ALGIERS
Julze 8 t b 1786
THOMAS
JEFFERSON
Esq! HONOURED
SIR I take the Liberty of addressing these letters to
you hoping you will excuse the freedom of an American kc. and unfortunate captive at present. No doubt but Mr Lamb has given
you and M: Adams every articular information respecting the state
of affairs in Algiers. I am much s rized when I look a t the date
of your letter to us being the 4'Q o s o v e m b e r & with orders to ME
Lamb to redeem us Americans. I am surprized that from the 4'4
of November until the 2oth of March that Mr Lamb did not get our
redemption ascertained by some person in Algiers. But he retarding

2

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1785 TO 1801

the time until he could make it convenient to come himself and not
informing himself of the method generally used towards the redemption of captives, but on the contrary comes to Algiers and gives out
that he came to redeem the Americans.
I t was immediately signified to the Dey that Mr Lamb had brought
money for that purport, it became such a town talk that the Dey
hard1 knew what sum to ask. after a few days the Dey asks what
sum ! k r Lamb would give. M? Lamb signified he would give ten
thousand dollars. the Dey then said 50,000. I think the demand
was very a propos to the offer of Mr Lamb. Mr Lamb tried to get
the Dey to lower his price, but the Dey was determined not to lower
his price any thing worth mentioning.
We are much surprized that Mr Lamb should bring so trifling a
sum as five or six thousand dollars to redeem 21. Even if the Dey
had let us go agreeable to your calculation he could not have redeemed
us. But Mr Lamb when he first arrived told us he would get us
along in a few days, which much disappointed us, for he afterwards
told us he had no money to redeem us. what he had was for presents
if he succeeded in a cessation of hostilities with this Regency. one
time he would say his funds were in Holland - then in Spain, and
then that you & Mr Adams had given no power only to draw for £3300
stie & that Mr Randal must write the order. so that in his own
language his hands were tyed by the ministers. I believe the Dey
of Algiers was well convinced that Americans would give the sum he
asked. I have reason to suspect that the Dey had a hint conveyed
to him by the British Consul, who you may be assured is an inveterate
enemy to the Americans. about 5 months ago I wrote Mr Carmichael
that the British Consul had put himself to great trouble in sending
expresses to his court. about that time was the first time that he
knew that it was the intention of the Americans to sue for a peace
with the Barbary States. I t is not the interest of any commercial
nation that the Americans should obtain a peace with the Barbary
States, whilst they reap such benefits in being the carriers of our
commerce, particularly the English, French & Spanish being jealous
of us. Consider Sir what great insurance we pay in getting our
vessels insured. in a short time the great insurance we pay would
obtain us a peace, or our ships obliged to be sold or with the greatest
difliculty in procuring English registers and passes - if not soon
remedied our trade must fall into some other chanel. and with the
greatest difficulty we shall retrieve it again, our seamen having no
longer employment in the United states but must through necessity
seek a living in some other country. The British Consul I think
informs his court respecting the time when the Algerine cruisers
generally go out by that means the people of England take the greatest advantage on insurin American property. and is their policy
& benefit to spread the f a m much greater than i t really is. there
er of our commerce being prevented by the Algerines if
we
keep c ear of the streights, coasts of Spain &Q Portugal and the
is no
Madeiras. we may trade to France, England, Holland, Sweden
and any where to the N. of 44' N. LatdP
The Algerine cruisers generally go out in April but uncommon
they went out the 25th of May this year. they generdly make three
crwses a year finish about the 20t5 November & then unrig & ly b
until the next year. the Algerines have no merchant ships or vesse

dY

for trade excepting a few coasting craft which go along shore with
wheat &c the French b u g thew carriers in commerce & nothing
great. their marine strength is nine sail of xebecs, one of 32 guns,
one of 30. three of 24 and three of 18. and one of 12 guns - the
vessels are small to the metal they carry. X of the crews are Turks.
the remainder Algerine Moors.
A war with the Algerines would be a very expensive war they
having no merchant men ~t would be attended m t h a very great
expence, on our slde the expence of building a force adequate to the
Ugerines to get men to keep that force in commission. and still
it would be a great risque to trade, you are fully sensible the sum i t
would take ta redeem a few - and then it would dter the insurance
but trifling.
The United States should use every means to obtain a peace with
the Barbary States, although it would cost vast sums, for until all
obstacles are removed that prevent commerce we cannot expect to
be a commercial nation. it is bad policy to use any threats or make
any parade with cruisers if we intend suing for a peace, but on the
contrary let these people see that we are inclinable for a peace - no
doubt but it was great policy in the Dey to refuse Mc Lamb a t first
on the terms of peace. consider Sir the policy of this Regency in all
their transactions with the Christian nations. but I believe they are
inclinable to a peace with the Americans but should for political
views be negotiated very private, particularly by the Americans. I
believe they gave Mr Lamb su5cient reason to believe so. they seem
well inclined to a peace with us, and I believe would take some naval
stores as masts, yards, planks, scantling, tar & turpentine. the
English, French, Dutch, Danes & Swedes and I may say all nations
are tributary to them - making them valuable presents & supplying
them. The Algerines would never redeem or make an exchange with
any nation they should be at war with. the Dey of &em cares not
about his people particularly the Moors. the Turks he sets a little
store by. those nations that he has been at war with for ages have
experienced it. i t is the policy of Christian nations to keep those
nations of Turks & Moors at war with other Christian Nations. and
the people in general here wish for a war with those nations in the
streights, for I am sure that nothing but so great s sum as the Spaniards
are to give would reconcile those people to the Spaniards, they having
such an inveteracy against them for persecuting the Mahometan
religion -but money is the God of Algiers & Mahomet their prophet.
they like those nations that they are afraid of & that give them most.
But should the Algerines be influenced by the commercial Christian
nations not to make a peace with the United States, then we should
exert ourselves & fit out ships mounting about 24. guns. nine of that
force and two brigs, a schooner also -fast sailing vessels & have them
coppered for the sooner we would harrass those people the better for
we ~houldif so lucky as to take two or three of them. they would be
mclmable to a peace and on easier terms for us. To rendezvous at
Mahon & Gibraltar, and often to come in sight of Algiers. and I
make no doubt when they found a spirited nation against them they
would alter their opinion. not to be afraid of them like unto those
dastardly natiops, that have given them such reason to boast of a
superiority in courage to Christians. The Algerines have 55. gun
boats in case of an invasion or attack on the city which is very strong

4

being well fortified & I think they are a tolerable smart active people,
spirited in an attack, but with any thing of a warm reception easily
repulsed. they put great confidence in boarding therefore ought to
be well barracked. if they can avoid an action it is their choice to be
off.
The Algerines do not expect to derive any great advantage by
being at war with the Americans, our country being so far situated
from them, they will not attempt to approach our coasts. they have
very little Idea of America and I believe the British Consuls used their
influence in signifying to the Algerines the unjustness of our cause,
but since we arrived here we used our influence to convince them of
the justness of our quarrel which they say that if they were in our
situation they would do the same. There is a great difference between
negociating with those people and a Christian nation. the foundation
of all treaties should be laid by some person or Consul in Algiers that
knows how to treat with them for there are certain times & seasons
for those affairs. The Dey's sentiments aIways ought to be well
sounded and the sentiments of his ministers and head men for it is
by them all business is transacted with him for they have the Dey's
ear at command particularly the Causennage who is head minister.
the Micklassha is the next. he is son in law to the Causennage and
is Generalissimo of all the Fortiiications - entire direction of the
Marine - a particular favorite of the Dey, and I think no man fills
his office better. a valuable present to the Micklassha & Causennage
chosen by some man that is well acquainted with what suits those
men best. I am sure it would be very requisite & not hove away.
The Dey is well advanced in years, and I am sure when he goes to
his long home that there will be a very great change in the state of
affairs in this Regency. The Causennage will be his successor & the
Micklassha will be the prime minister. If anyone knows those peoples
policy I should think the Count DIExpilly does; being a year here
negociating the Spanish peace & has had so many conferences with
the Dey & his ministers. he has got the great men in office on his
side. Give a Turk money with one hand & you may take his Eyes
out with the other.
Since the Brig arrived from Tunis which is the brig which Mr Lamb
came to Algiers in, the brig was overhawled & the Captain examined
by the Micklassha respecting the property. I am credibly informed
by a Gentleman by the name of Capt. Bassline, who is a great favorite
of the Micklassha's, that the Micklassha was well convinced by the
information he had that the brig was an American property, which I
heard the evening the brig arnved in &em.
but the Micklassha
despised any such mean action but s i m e d to the Dey that the
report was false. I hope this particular favor shewn the Americans
by the Micklassha will not escape your notice but by every prudent
step cultivate the friendship of so great & so good a man. The
information by all I can learn & I have every reason to believe was
given by the British Consul, Mr Lamb's bosom friend. it is said
& I have been credibly informed that Mr Logie had the information
from a M? Gregory British Consul in Barcelona, and I should think
it a very dangerous affair for the brig to come to Algiers again particularly with money for or redemption as there is no knowing the
policy and political views of those people in Algiers. Permit me to
mention to you that if it was not convenient to redeem US when the

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS

time is advanced which Mc Lamb signified to the Dey that it would
be good policy to get us on the Spanish list as the Spaniards have
not yet agreed on the price for their people; and inasmuch as the
Count DIExpilly may get us for less than what the Dey asks, and as
we were taken on the time when the Spaniards were about settling a
truce unknown to the Americans. Delays breed danger & opportunity
once lost is not easily recovered, and our captivity will become an
old affair and here we shall remain.
The American peace hangs on a thread but I make no doubt if well
planned but the United States will obtain it.
The Neapolitan & Portuguese Ambassadors are shortly expected
here, it is uncertain that they will obtain a peace, but if they do I will
engage the Portuguese particularly will pay well for lt. The Spaniards
have not surmounted all their difficulties yet with those people.
but I believe i t will take some time yet - a few days ago arrived a
Venitian & a French Vessel with shot &c. for the Dey. The Venitian
brought their tribute which was about 10,000 Algerine sequins and
about 5,000 dollars worth of presents, but they accepted the tribute &
I believe would not accept the presents. so that it is supposed when
the Algerines settle with the Spaniards that they will be apt to commit
hostilities on the Venitians. such tricks are very common to them.
I t is believed Mr John Wolfe will not get to be Spanish Consul in
Algiers, but I am very sure he is a very good man; no one in Algiers
better acquanted with the ways & policy of this Regency and would
be a very fit man to transact an business for any nation. I refer you
to M: Carmichael & Mr Itand& for his character and must observe
that there is no doing any thing among those people without mone
all the crowned heads in Europe to write to the Dey of Algiers wo&
avail but very little. to negotiate a peace with the Algemes should
be a statesman well acqunnted with the different languages. but as I
have said before the foundation should be laid by some Consul in
Algiers whom the United States could depend on and then an American
to come & conclude it. A good Consul is very requisite here.
We are much surprized at M: h b ' s ungentleman like behaviour
whilst he was in Algiers & could hardly believe Congress would [have]
sent such a man to negociate so important an affair as the making a
peace with the Algerines where it required the most able Statesman
& Politician.
The Count disapproved of his behaviour much & said he was a very
uncapable man to treat for the redemption of us & worse for making the
Peace. A man tbat has no regularity in small affairs m 4 l have none in
great ones. There is no Consul or man that has the least friendship
for the Americans but says he was a very unable man & not the
gentleman, which I believe sir, when we can make such an observation
On him we are sensible that a man of your abilities can have no great
opinion of him.
Mr Lamb's unguarded expressions, his hints, threats &c. despising
the French & Spaniards, signifying their deciet & in fact every thing
that he possibly could utter in the most vulgar language that i t was
mth pain we see him so unworthy of his commission & the cloth he
wore. his particular intimacy with Mc Logie the British Consul,
M! Iamb's bosom friend who I believe got all his secrets frqm
~ a l doften that the Americans had taken two forts on the M ~ s s ~ s s l p ~
from the Spaniards and often in the hearing of some servants who

NAVAL OPERATIOhTS FROM 1786 TO 1801

6

spoke English that if the Spaniards did not assist the Americans in
making their peace that we should take some of their territory from
them. no doubt but the Count was informed of all this. for one of
Mr Lamb's servants is servant to the Count a t present, & Mr Lamb
often said in my presence to Mr Wolfe that he (meaning M' Wolfe)
or the Count would have all the honor of laying the foundation of the
peace.
Sir we are very sensible of your particular attention to us, & through
your & Mr Carmichaels care of us, we are indebted for the particular
civility & attention of the Ct D'Expilly & French Consul. But still
it is impossible for us to be content whdst we are under the character
of slaves, so disagreeable is confinement to the men of the Land of
Liberty. My crew go through the severities of slavery that is possible
for men to endure. Capt? Stevens & Coffi have families. & a t
present unknown how provided for. I have an aged mother, brother
& sisters. that their whole dependance & subsistence was on me.
certainly the longer we stay here the greater expence we shall incur
on our country. If we do not make our grievances known to you sir I
am sure who can we apply to we have wrote to America when we were
first taken, but not one of us has received a letter & cannot tell what
our country has resolved on respecting us. we must submit to our
hard fate & trust to God & our country to extricate us from Algiers.
I hope Mr Barclay will succeed with the Maroccians - their situation
being more in the way of annoying us than the Algerines. I am surprized M': Lamb did not pay Mr Logie the small sum of about 5 guineas
which Mr Logie paid to the marine for excluding us from it. M'
Lamb often insisted Mr Logie to make some charge, but at last Logie
made a charge & Mr Lamb did not pay him.

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1786 TO 1801

To John Adams, U. 8. Minister to London, England, from Thomas Jefferson,
V. S . Minister to Paris, France

PARIS,
July 11, 1786.
DEAR
SIR,-Our btrurtions relative to the Barbary States having
required us to proceed by way of negotiation to obtain their peace, it
became our duty to do this to the best of our power. Whatever might
be our private opinions, they were to be suppressed, and the line,
marked out to us, was to be followed. It has been so, honestly and
zealously. I t was, therefore, never material for us to consult together,
on the best plan of conduct towards these States. I acknowledge, I
very early thought it wodd be best to effect a peace through the
medium of war. Though it is a question with which we have nothing
to do, yet as you propose some discussion of it, I shall trouble you
with my reasons. Of the fonr positions laid don- in your letter of
the 3d instant, I agree to the three first, which are, in substance, that
the good offices of our friends cannot procure us a peace, without
paying its pnce; that they cannot ma.terially lessen that price; and
that payiDg it, we can have the peace m spite of the intngues of our
enemies. As to the fourth, that the longer the negotiation is delayed,
the larger will be the demand; this will depend on the intermediate
captures: if they are many and rich, the price may be raised; il few
and poor, i t will be lessened. However, if it is decided that we shall
buy a peace, I know no reason for delaying the operation, but should
rather think it ought to be hastened; but I should prefer the obtaining
i t by wm.
1. Justice is in favor of this opinion. 2. Honor favors it. 3. I t
will procure us respect in Europe; and respect is a. safeguard to interest.
4. It wiU arm the federal head with the safest of all the instruments of
coercion over its delinquent members, and prevent i t from using what
would be less safe. I think that so far, you go with me. But in the
next steps, we shall m e r . 5. I think i t least expensive. 6. Equallv
effectual. I ask a fleet of one hundred and fifty uns, the one-half of
which shall be in constant cruise. This fleet, bui t, manned and victualled for six months will cost four hundred and fifty thousand pounds
sterling. Its annual expense will be three hundred pounds sterling a
gun, including everything; this will be forty-five thousand pounds
sterling a year. 1 take British experience for the basis of my calculation: though vie know, from our own experience, that we can do in
this way, for pounds lawful, what costs them pounds sterhg. Were
we to charge all this to the Algerine war, i t would amount to little
more than we must pay, if we buy peace. But as it is proper tmd
necessary that we should establish a small marine force, (even were
we to buy a peace from the Algerines,) and as that force, laid up in
our dock-yards, wodd cost us half as much annually, as if kept in
order for service, we have a right to say that only twenty-two thousand
and five hundred pounds sterling, per annum, should be charged to
the Algerine war. 6. It will be as effectual. To all the mismanagements of Spain and Portugal, ur ed to show that war against those
people is ineffectual, I urge a sing e fact to prove the contrary, where
there is any management. About forty years ago, the Algerines
having broke their treaty with France, this court sent Monsieur de
Massiac, with one large, and two small f ' ates; he blockaded the
harbor of Algiers three months, and they su scribed to the terms he

f

proposed. If it be admitted, however, that war, on the fairest prospects, is still exposed to uncertainties, I weigh against this, the greater
uncertainty of the duration of a peace bought with money, from such
a people, from a Dey eighty years old, and by a nation who, on the
hypothesis of buying peace, is to have no power on the sea, to enforce
an observance of it.
So far, I have gone on the supposition that the whole weight of this
war would rest on us. But, 1. Naples wiU join us. The character of
their naval minister (Acton), his known sentiments with respect to
the peace Spain is officiously trying to make for them, and his dispositions against the Algerines, give the best grounds to believe it. 2.
Every principle of reason assures us that Portugal will join us. I
state this as taking for granted, what all seem to believe, that they
w i l l not be at peace with Algiers. I suppose, then, that a convention
might be formed between Portugal, Naples and the United Stabs, by
which the burthen of the war might be quotaed on them, according
to their respective wealth; and the term of it should be, when
em
should subscribe to a peace with all three, on equal t e r r n s . ~ h i s
might be left open for other nations to accede to, and many, if not
most of the powers of Europe, (except France, England, Holland, and
Spain, if her peace be made) would sooner or later enter into the confederacy, for the sake of having their peace with the piratical States
guaranteed by the whole. I suppose, that, in this case, our proportion of force would not be the half of what I first calculated on.
These are the reasons which have influenced my judgment on this
question. I give them to you, to show you that I am imposed on by a
semblance of reason, at least; and not with an expectation of their
changing your opinion. You have viewed the subject, I am sure, in
dl its bearing. You have weighed both questions, with all their circumstances. You make the result different from what I do. The
same facts impress us differently. This is enough to make me suspect
an error in my process of reasoning, though T am not able to detect it.
It is of no consequence; as I have nothing to say in the decision, and am
ready to proceed heartily on any other plan which may be adopted, if
my agency should be thought useful. With respect to the dispositions of the State, I am utterly uninformed. I cannot help thinking,
however, that on a view of all the circumstances, they might be united
in either of the plans.
Having written this on the receipt of your letter, without knowing of
any opportunity of send in,^ it, I know not when it will go- I add nothing, therefore, on any other subject, but assurances of the sincere
esteem and respect with which I am, dear Sir, your friend and servant.

DEARSIR,- I have received the ratification of the Prussian treaty,
and next Thursday shall set off for the Hague, in order to exchange i t

with the Baron de Thulemeier.
Your favor of the 11th instant I have received. There are great
and weighty considerations urged in it in favor of arming against the
Algerines, and, I confess, if our States could be brought to agree in the
measure, I should be very willing to reaolve upon extarnal war with

12

vigor, and protect our trade and people. The resolution to fight them
would raise the spirits and courage of our countrymen immediately,
and we might obtain the glory of f i n d breaking up these nests of
banditti. But congress will never, or at east not for years, take any
such resolution, and in the mean time our trade and honor suffers
beyond calculation. We ought not to fight them at all, unless we
determine to fight them forever.
This thought, I fear, is too rugged for our people to bear. To f i ~ h t
them a t the expense of millions, and make eace, after all, by g i m
more money and larger presents than wo d now procure perpetua
peace, seems not to be economical. Did Monsieur de Massac carry
his point without making the presents? Has not France made presents ever since? Did any nation ever make peace with any one
Barbary state without making the presents? Is there an example of
it? I believe not, and fancy you w i l l find that even Massac himself
made the presents.
I agree ~n opinion of the wisdom and necessity of a navy for other
uses, but am apprehensive it will make bad worse with the Algerines.
I will go all lengths with you in promoting a navy, whether to be
applied to the Algerines or not. But I think, at the same time, we
should treat. Your letter, however, has made me, easier upon this
point. Nevertheless, to humble the Algerines, I think you have
undercalculated the iorce necessary. They have now fifty gun-boats,
which, being small objects against great ships, are very formidable.*
None of these existed in the time of Monsieur Massac. The harbor
of Algiers, too, is fortified all round, which i t was not in M. Massac's
time, which renders i t more difficult and dangerous to attempt a
blockade. I know not what dependence is to be put upon Portugal
and Naples, in case of I-L war with the barbarians; perhaps they might
assist us in some degree. Blocking Algiers would not obtain peace
with Morocco; so that our commerce would still be exposed.
After all, though I am glad we have exchanged a letter on the subject, I preceive that neither force nor money will be applied. Our
States are so backward, that they will do nothing for some years.
If they get money enough to discharge the demands upon them in
Europe already incurred, I shall be agreeably disappointed. A disposition seems rather to prevail amon our citizens ta give up a11 idem
of navigation and naval power, and ay themselves consequent1 a t
the mercy of foreigners, even far the prices of therr produce. f t is
their concern, and we must submit; for your plan of fighting will no
more be adopted, than mine of treating. This is more humiliating to
me than 'ving the presents would be. I have a letter from Mr. Jay
but an acknowledgment of
of 7th J&, by packet, oontabng not*
our letter of 25th April. New Hampshm and Rhode Island have
suspended their navigation acts, and Massachusetts, now left alone,
w i l l suspend theirs. So that all will be left to the convention, whose
system, if they form one, will not be completed, adopted, and begin to
operate, under &eve& years. Congress have received the answer,
which you saw, to my memorial of 30th November; and Mr. Ramsay
writes me he is not &tressed a t it, because it will produce a repeal of
all the laws against recovering private debts.

Four weeks ago we learned by the master of a Swedish Ship from
Alicant that M' Lamb had sent the brig with his despatches for Congress $ that he expected an answer shortly. We recieved a letter
from him yesterday dated in Alicant of the 7t@Inst. he informs us that
matters turned out so that he sent the brig for America, & that he
expected shortly to have new orders. I am v e y confident that MI
Adams & M Jefferson acted for the best, but take the liberty of
mentioning to you that it was badly planned & worse executed, but I
am much s u ~ r b e dthat they were not better informed respecting
From Mc Jefferson's letter he expected that we

would be redeemed & wished us a happy sight of our country. Mr
Lamb said & shewed me his orders that M Lamb's limits were only
100 dollars for a sailor. I am sure no man could think we possibly
could be redeemed at that price. M' Lamb declared he had but 6000
dollars, & that was not appropriated for us, but for presents to these
peoples. I have mentioned you in the proper manner to ME Wolfe.
he has been unwell these five weeks. M' Wolfe also has mentioned

14

you.@ very friendly language to us, & has a very great opinion of your
abihties & that you had behaved m t h great zeal to serve your country.
We are losing a very favorable opportunity in Algiers respecting
paving the way towards our peace which is of very great importance
to the United States. perhaps the ministers have some other plan in
view. M: Lamb's plan was to set all Europe a fighting or to take some
of the Spanish territory in America & thereby oblige the Spaniards to
make our peace. he ought not to have thought it much more say it.

* * *

I am informed that Mr Barclay has effected a peace with Morocco.
I hope it may be so, their situation being more detrimental to our com-

merce than the Algerines. The Algerine cruisers of nine sail of chebecks sailed the 14th of August and to this date has but sent in one
prize which was a s m d vessel of 40 ton belonging to Sardinia. their
number on board was 14 men & a woman, supposed of some rank. I
hope no American will be so unlucky as to fall in their way as nothing
would be more detrimental to the peace & our redemption. I am informed by the master of a vessel lately from Gibraltar that there had
been a ship belonging to Baltimore or Philadelphia there loaded with
flour & that after discharging her cargo, she sailed for Malaga. I wish
they would be more sparing of their American colours in the streights.
I t is well known in Algiers that such vessels are in Spain.

Respecting the Portuguese Mr Logie says the Dey would not listen
to any proposition the Count made, for he said & they generally say
here that they have made too much peace, & that if they were to make
a peace with the Portuguese that they would have no nation worth
cruising against. I t seems reasonable to me this regency will be always
at war with some nations that they are not a f r ~ dof being invaded
by, & it is greatly in favor of the American peace that we are so far
situated from them that they cannot go on our coasts, not like those
nations in the streights that the Algerines in 36 hours are on their
coasts & successful in taking prizes. The Dey said to the Count
when he asked for a peace for the Neapolitans that be would miramus,
or see about it. Those people will not have many negotiations on hand
at one time; they want to get done with one thing first, before they
begin another. * * *
We are treated with a great deal of civility by the French consul
and Mr Gimong a French merchant here. Monsr Ford the gentleman we are boarded with is a worthy respectable character & does
every thing in his power to make our situation agreeable. I hope the
French & Spanish will experience the like return & be treated with
much lenity in America. We are four at Mr Ford's, five in the Dey's
house and one at the Swedish consuls and eleven in the marine, where
the poor men endure the severities of slavery. I wrote a long letter
by the Count to Mr Jefferson, but have no answer a s yet. * * *

employed on fhe most laborious work & so much exhausted that if some
speedy measure is not adopted to redeem them from slavery I am
afraid they will all be carried off by the pest, as it rages much, on the
226 of this month there died 215 people in Algiers, & in those three
months past there have died 200 Christian slaves. The Spaniards &
Neapolitans having redeemed their people there are a t present but
800 slaves belonging to Bylicke & about 120 slaves belonging to privata
property. Therefore we expect to be called to the marine as there is
a scarcity of slaves at present to do the requisite duty on board the
Algerine cruisers. One of my crew is dead and another after having
the pest 14 days with two large buboes on him i t has pleased God
that he should recover. * * * I t is my sincere opimon that the
Dey & his Ministers consider that they made a regular bargain with
M Lamb for our ransom, & I believe it is recorded so on the public
books of this regency, & should not be surprized if another American
Ambassador was to come to Algiers, at the Dey's t e b g him he hsd
made one bargain already with the Americans, which they did not
fulfill.
I t seems the Neapolitan Ambassador had obtained a truce wit,h
this Regency for three months, & the Ambassador wrote his court
of his success, but about the l U tof April when the cruisers were fitting
out the Ambassador went to the Dey & hoped the Dey would give
the necessary orders to the Captains of his cruisers not to take the
Neapolitan vessels. the Dey said the meaning of the truce was for
not to take the Neapolitan cruisers, but if his chebecs should meet
the Neapolitan merchantmen to take them & send them for Algiers.
The Ambassador said that the Neapolitan cruisers would not want a
pass on those terms. the Dey said if his chebecks should meet either
men of war or merchant vessels to take them, so gave orders accordingly. The Blgerines sailed the 9%inst. & are gone I believe off the
coast of Italy. This shews there is very little confidence to be put
in the ro al word. no principle of national honor will bind those
people & believe not much confidence to be put in them in treaties.
The Algerines are not inclinable to a peace, with the Neapolitans.
I hear of no negotiation. when the two frigates arrive with the
money for the ransom of the slaves I believe they are done with the
Neapolitans. Theb] being so handily situated to them, in 24 hours
the cruisers are on the coasts of Italy, which is a great inducement for
not making s peace. On the 2 3 G s t . anived a Neapolitan prize to
the Algerines, & on the 25'h arrive a Neapolitan Jittan [or Jithan]
a prize. They were taken near the gulph of Genoa. The crews of
them escaped with their boats. This is a great inducement to the
Algerines not to make a peace with the N e a p o l i t ~ &
, the Algerines
being under no dread of a bombardment on them city, therefore if
they should obtain a peace, the terms will certainly be very high.
I t certainly makes a great difference with these people, a making
peace with Naples or America. for they well know we are situated
a t a great distance from them, & if we do not come in their way they
will not go on our coasts being a great dmtance & navigation that
they are not acquainted with. The Neapolitans are very handy to
them & having many merchant vessels, the Blgerines are generally
attended with success in taking some every cruise.

!I

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1786 TO 1801
The Spaniards have paid a great sum for their peace 1,200,000
dollars is the sum paid m Algiers. The Government is very rich &
the Dey is very political. No nation can fit out an equal number of
cruisers so cheap as the Dey of Algiers. In Algiers the cruisers are
not all public vessels, there me about three out of the nine that belong
to Bylic, the rest belong to head-oscers as Prime minister, General
of the Marine, & General of the County, Lord of the Bed-chamber &c.
Those great men owning the cruisers, they do not wish for peace with
these nations in the Streights. The present Dey is very old, & I
believe cannot live many ears. when he goes to his long home I dare
say there will be a great c ange in the policy of this Regency, making
war on some & making peace with others. It is a great thing in a
peace with Algiers to make the treaty with the Dey that has just got
the government in his hands as i t may be more likely he might keep
to the treaty he made himself & they generally do not mind what
treaties the former Deys make. I t is customary with every Dey to
renew all treaties. Tunis being tributarg to Algiers it would be
requisite in the treaty with Algiers to notice Tunis. I t is not very
easy to know the proper way of laying the foundation of a treaty with
those Algerines. Be assured that the foundation of all treaties should
be laid by some person that could be depended on in Algiers, & then a
wise man to come & conclude the treaty. I should not put much
confidence in any Consul in Algiers to have the managing of the
American treaty. for i t is well known that those nations that are a t
perace with the Barbary States do not wish that any other nation should
obtain a peace, that they should not reap part of those advantageous
branches of commerce in the Mediterranean. Before the mar the
Americans used to employ 200 sail of merchantmen in the streights
trade, & used to reap great advantages by it, but a t present our
trade is but smaIl being cramped on all quarters, which must certainly
hurt the Americans much, & when once commerce gets into mother
chanel, it is a long time before i t is brought back again. Certainly
the Indies of the French is their trade in the Mediterranean. The
French are too knowing to admit us to be sharers of this valuable
trade. They & many more trading nations will leave many obstacles
in the way of the Americans obtainkg a peace with the Barbary
States. The Algerines are in no measure depending on the Grand
Seignor. They reverence him on account of his being the head or
protector of their religion. a little from him to the Dey of Algiers
has some weight in favor of the nation whom the Grand Seignor writes
about but letters from the Christian Kings have no weight. Money
is their God & Mahomet their Prophet. The Dey of Algiers must
conduct himself agreeably to the Parliament or the Soldiery, he not
being absoIute in every affair. Those great men here must give their
voice, & i t must be attended to by the Dey. The Causnagee, that is
the prime minister $ second Dey, it is beheved will succeed the Dey,
in the government of this regency. The Mickelhassee, or general of
the marine & fortifications, ~sson in law to the Causnagee, & it is
supposed will be prime minister. This man has very great influence
& no man can fill his office better than he does, it is he who directs the
cruisers where to cruise, & I believe that any thing he mentions or
advises the Dey to has much weight. Amongst all those great men
the Mickelhassee I believe is most in favor of the Americans. There
should [be] some man that could be depended on here, have power to

E

17

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS

lay the foundation of the American treaty & those great men should
be paid much attention to that have the Dey's ear a t command. A
few valuable resents given in a proper season to these p e a t men
would not be ove away, as I am sure no nation can obttLln a peace
here without they gain some of those great men in their favour.
When Mr Lamb asked for a peace the Dey undoubtedly mid he would
not treat, the Dey not knowing the minds of his ministry then had some
of those great men been in favour of America they would have shewed
the Dey that a war with America could not be athnded with m y
advantage to the Algerines as we were so far off & they would have
courted the Dey to make a peace with America, & once you get those
great men in favour of s nation a s they rise in office, they have the
more influence & are more apt to keep the treaties that i t was their
wish the former Dey should make than to keep treaties that they
wished the Dey had never made.

Message of President George Washington to the Congress of the United States
PRISONERS AT

ALGIERS.

Message from the Presided of the United Stafes to Congress, communicating a report of the Secretary of State, in relation to American
prisoners a Algiers.
UNITEDSTATES,
December SO, 1790.
Gentlemen of the Senate and House of Representatives:
I lay before you a report of the Secretary of State on the subject of
the citizens of the United States in captivity at Algiers, that you may
provide on their behalf, what to you shall seem most expedient.
GEO.WASHINGTON.
[Report]

The Secretary of State, having had under consideration the situation of the citizens of the United States in captivity at Algiers, makes
the following report thereupon to the President of the United States:
When the House of Representatives, at their. late session, were
pleased to refer to the Secretary of State, the pehtion of our citizens
in captivity a t Algiers, there still existed some expectation that
certain measures, which had been employod to effect their redemption,
the success of which depended on their secrecy, might prove effectual.
Information received during the recess of Congress has so far weakened
those expectations, as to make it now a duty to lay before the President
of the United States, a full statement of what hm been attempted for
the relief of these our suffering citizens, as well before, as since he

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS

19

came into office, that he may be enabled to decide what further is to
be done.
On the 25th of July, 1785, the schooner Maria, captain Stevens,
belonging to a Mr. Foster, of Boston, was taken off Cape St. tTincen$s,
by an Algerine corsair; and, five days afterwards, the s h p Dnuphzn,
captain O'Brien, belonging to Messieurs lrvins of Philadelphia, was
taken by another Algerine, about fifty leagues westward of Lisbon.
These vessels, with their cargoes and crews, twenty-one persons in
number, were carried in to Algiers.
Congress had some time before commissioned ministers plenipotenfor entering into treaties of amity and commerce with the
Bar ary Powers, and to send to them proper agents for preparing
such treaties. An agent was accordingly appointed for Algiers, and
his instructions prepared, when the hfhisters Plenipotentiary received
information of these captures. Though the ransom of captives was
not among the objects expressed in their commissions, because at
their dates the case did not exist, yet they thought it their duty to
undertake that ransom, fearing that the captives might be sold and
dispersed through the interior and distant wuntries of Africa, if the
previous orders of Congress should be waited for. They therefore
added a supplementary instruction to the agent to negotiate their
ransom. But, while acting thus without authority, they thought
themselves bound to offer a price so moderate as not to be disapproved.
They therefore restrained him to two hundred dollars a man; which
was something less than had been just before paid for about three
hundred French captives, by the Mathurins, a religious order of France,
instituted in ancient times for the redemption of Christian captives
from the infidel Powers. On the arrival of the agent at Algiem, the
Dey demanded fifty-nine thousand four hundred and ninety-six
dollars for the twenty-one captives, and could be brought to abate
but little from that demand. The agent, therefore, returned in 1786,
without having effected either peace or ransom.
In the beginning of the next year, 1787, the minister plenipotentiary
of the United States at Paris procured an interview with the general
of the religious order of Mathurins, before mentioned, to engage him to
lend his agency, at the expense of the United States, for the redemption of their captive citizens. He proffered at once, all the services
he could render, with the liberalit and the zeal which distinguish his
character. He observed, that he ad agents on the spot, constantly
emploped in seeking out and redeeming the capt i ~ e of
s their own country; that these should act for us, as for themselves: that nothing wuid
be accepted for their agency; and that he would only expect that the
price of redemption should be ready on our part, so ns to cover the
engagement into which he should enter. He added, that, by the time
all expenses were paid, their last redemption had amounted to near
two thousand five hundred livres a man, and that he could by no
means flatter us that they could redeem our captives as cheap as their
own. The pirates would take advantage of its being out of their
ordinary line. Still he was in hopes they would not be much higher.
The proposition was then submitted to Congress, that is to say,
in February, 1787, and on the 19th of September, in the same year,
their minister plenipotentiary a t Paris received their orders to embrace
the ~ffersof the Mathurins. This he immediately notified to the
generd, observing, however, that he did not desire him to entar into

tiaT

K

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1786 TO 1801
any engagements till a sugcient sum to cover them should be actually
deposited in Paris. The generd wished that the whole might be
kept rigorously secret, as, should the barbarians suspect him to be
acting for the United States, they would demand such sums as he
could never agree to give, even with our consent, because it would
injure his future purchases from them. He said he had information
from his agent at Algiers, that our captives received so liberal a daily
allowance as to evince that i t came from a public source. He recommended that this should be discontinued; enga g that he would
have an allowance administered to them, much s ort indeed of what
they had hitherto received, but such as was given to his own countrymen, quite sufficient for physical necessities, and more likeIy to prepare the opinion, that as they were subsisted by his charity, they
were to be redeemed by it also. These ideas, suggested to him by
the danger of raising his market, were approved by the minister
plenipotentiary; because, this being the first instance of a redemption
by the United States, i t would form a precedent, because a high price
@en by us might induce these pirates to abandon all other nations
in pursuit of Americans; whereas, the contrary would take place,
could our price of redem~t~ion
be fixed a t the lowest point.
To destroy, therefore, every expectation of a redemption by the
United States, the bills of the Spanish cons111 at Algiers, who had
made the kind advances before spoken of for the sustenance of our
captives, were not answered. On the contrary, a hint was given that
these advances had better be discontinued, as i t was not known that
they would be reimbursed. It was necessary even to go further, and
to suffer the captives themselves and their friends to believe for a
while, that no attention was paid to them, no notice taken of their
letters. They are still under this impression. It mould have been
unsafe to trust them with a secret, the disclosure of which might for
ever prevent their redemption, by raising the demands of the captors
to sums which a due regard for our seamen, still in freedom, would
forbid us to give. This was the most trying of all circumstances,
and drew from them the most afflicting reproachcs.
It was a twelve month afterwards before the money could be deposited in Paris, and the negotiation be actually put into train. In
the mean time the general had received information from Algiers of a
very considerable change of prices there. Within the last two or
three years the Spaniards, the Neapolitans, and the Russians, had
redeemed at exorbitant sums. Slaves were become scarce, and would
hardly be sold at any price. Still he entered on the business with an
assurance of doing the best in his power; and he was authorized to
offer as far m three thousand livres, or five hundred and fifty-five
dollars a man. He wrote immediately to consult a confidential agent
at Marseilles, on the best mode of carrying this business into effect;
from whom he received the answer No. 2, hereto annexed.
Nothing further was known of his progress or prospects, when the
House of Representatives were pleased, a t their last session, to refer
the petition of our captives a t Algiers to the Secretary of State, The
preceding narrative shows that no report could have then been made
without risking the object, of which some hopes were still entertained.
Later advices, however, from the charge des daires of the United
States, a t Paris, informs us, that these measures, though not yet
dwperate, are not to be counted on. Besidea the exorbitance of

f?

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS

21

price, before feared, the late transfer of the lands and revenues of
the clergy in France to the public, by withdrawing the means, seems
to have suspended the proceedings of the Mathurins in the purposes
of their institution.
It is time, therefore, to look about for something more promising,
without relinquishing, in the mean while, the chance of success through
them. Endeavors to collect information, which have been continued
a considerable time, as to the ransoms which would probably be
demanded from us, and those actually paid by other nations, enable
the Secretary of State to lay before the President the following short
view, collected from original papers now in his possession, or from
information delivered to him personally. Passing over the ransoms
of the Mathurins, which are kept f a r below the common level by
special circumstances:
In 1786, the dey of Algiers demanded from our ngent 59,496 dollars
for 21 ca tives, which was 2,833 dollars a man. The agent flattered
himself t ey could be ransomed for 1,200 dollars apiece. His secretary informed us, at the same time, that Spain had paid 1,600 dollars.
In 1787, the Russians redeemed a t 1,546 dollars a man.
I n 1788, a well informed inhabitant of Algiers assured the minister
plenipotentiary of the United States at Paris, that no nation had
redeemed, since the Spanish treaty, a t less than from 250 to 300
pounds sterling, the medium of whichis 1,237dollars. Captain O'Brien,
at the same date, thinks we must pay 1,800 dollars, and mentions a
Savoy captain, just redeemed at 4,074 dollars.
In 1789, Mr. Logie, the English consul a t Algiers, informed a
person who wished to ransom one of our common sailors, that he would
cost from 450 to 500 pounds starling, the mean of which is 2,137 dollars.
In December of the same year, Captain O'Brien thiTlks our men w i l l
now cost 2,920 dollars each, though a Jew merchant believes he could
get them for 2,264 dollars.
I n 1790, July gth, a Mr. Simpson, of Gibraltar, who, a t some
particular request, had taken pains to find for what sum our captives
could be redeemed, h d s that the fourteen will cost 34,792.28 dollars,
which is 2,485 dollars a man. At the same date, one of them, a
Scotch boy, a common mariner, was actually redeemed at 8,000 livres,
equal to 1,481 dollars, which is within 19 dollars of the price Simpson
states for common men: and the charge des affaires of the United
States a t Paris is informed that the whole may be redeemed at that
rate, adding fifty per cent. on the captains, which would bring it to
1,571 dollars a mm.
I t is found then that the prices are 1,200, 1,237, 1,481, 1,546,
1,571, 1,600, 1,800, 2,137, 2,264, 2,485, 2,833, and 2,920 dollars a
man, not noticing that of 4,074 dollars, because i t was for s cap*.
In 1786, there were 2,200 captives in Algiers, which, in 1789, had
been reduced by death or ransom to 655. Of ours six have died, and
one has been I-ansomed by his friends.
From these facts and opinions, some conjecture may be formed of
the terms on which the liberty of our citizens may be obtained.
But should i t be thought better to repress force by force, another
expedient for their liberation may perhaps offer. Captures made on
the enemy may perhaps put us into ossession of some of their mariners,, and exchange be substituted or ransom. It is not indeed a
fixed usage with them to exchange prisoners. It is rather their

%

P

22

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1785 TO 1801

custom to refuse it. However, such exchanges are sometimes effected,
by allowing them more or less of advantage. They have sometimes
accepted of two Moors for a Christian, at others they have refused
five or six for one. Perhaps Turkish captives may be objects of
greater artiality with them, as their government is entirely in the
hands o Turks, who are treated in every instance as a superior order
of beings. Exchange, too, wiU be more practicable in our case, as
our captives have not been sold to private individuals, but are retamed
in the hands of the Government.
The liberation of our citizens has an intimate connexion with the
liberation of our commerce in the Mediterranean, now under the
consideration of Congress. The distresses of both proceed from the
same cause, and the measures which shall be adopted for the relief
of the one, may, very probably, involve the relief of the other.

[NDA. Am. State Papers, Foreign Rel., Vol. 1.1

[28 December 17901
Report of Secretary of State to the Congress of the United States
MEDITERRANEAN TRADE.

Report of the Secretay of State relative to the Mediterranean Trade.
Communicated to the House of Representatives, December SO, 1790,
and to the Senate, January 3, 1791.
The Secretary of State, to whom was referred by the House of
Representatives so much of the speech of the President of the United
States to both Houses of Congress, as relates to the trade of the United
States in the Mediterranean, with instructions to report thereupon to
the House, has had the same under consideration, and thereupon
makes the following report:
The loss of the records of the custom houses in several of the States,
which took place about the commencement and during the course of
the late war, has deprived us of official information as to the extent
of our commerce and navigation in the Mediterranean sea. According
to the best which may be obtained from other sources meriting respect,
i t may be concluded, that about one-sixth of the wheat and flour
exported from the United States, and about one-fourth in value of
their dried and pickled fish, and some rice, found their best markets
in the Mediterranean ports; that these articles constituted the principal part of what we sent into that sea; that, that commerce loaded
outwards, from eighty to one hundred ships, annually, of twenty
thousand tons, navigated by about twelve hundred seamen. It was
abandoned early in the war. And after the peace which ensued, it
was obvious to our merchants, that their adventures into that sea
would be exposed to the depredations of the piratical States on the
coast of Barbary. Congress, too, was very early attentive to this
danger, and by a commission of the 12th of May, 1784, authorized
certain persons, named ministers plenipotentiary for that purpose, to
conclude treaties of peace and amity with the Barbctry Powers. And
it b e ' i afterwards found more expedient that the negotiations should
be carried on a t the residences of those Powers, Congress, by a further
commission, bearing date the 11th of March, 1785, empowered the
same ministers plenipotentiary to appoint agents to repair to the said

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS

23

Powers a t their proper residences, and there to negotiate such treaties.
The whole expenses were limited to eighty thousand dollars. Agents
were accordingly sent to Morocco and Al 'ers.
Before the appointment of the one to h?orocco, i t was known that a
cruiser of that State had taken a vessel [*I of the United States; and
that the Emperor, on the friendly interposition of the court of Madrid,
had liberated the crew, and made restitution of the vessel and cargo,
as far as their condition admitted. This was a happy presage of the
liberal treaty he afterwards concluded with our agent, still under the
friendly mediation of Spain, and at an expense of between nine and
ten thousand dollars only. On his death, which has taken place not
long since, it becomes necessary, according to their usage, to obtain
immediately a recognition of the treaty by his successor, and wnsequently, to make provisions for the expenses which may attend it
The amount of the former furnishes one ground of estimate; but the
character and dispositions of the successor, which are unknown here,
may influence it materially. The friendship of this Power is important, because our Atlantic as well as Mediterranean trade is open to
his annoyance, and because we carry on a useful commerce with his
nation
The Algerines had also taken two vessels of the United States,
with twenty-one persons on board, whom they retained as slaves. On
the arrival of the agent sent to that regency, the Dey refused utterly
to treat of peace on any terms, and demanded 59,496 dollars for the
ransom of our captives. This mission therefore proved ineffectual.
While these negotiations were on foot at Morocco and Algiers, an
ambassador from Tripoli arrived in London. The ministers plenipotentiary of the United States met him in person. He demanded for
the peace of that State thirty thousand guineas; and undertook to
engage that of Tunis for a like sum. These demands were beyond
the limits of Congress and of reason, and nothing was done. Nor was
it of importance, as, Algiers remaining hostile, the peace of Tunis and
Tripoli was of no value; and when that of the former should be obtained, theirs would soon follow.
Our navigation, then, into the Mediterranean, has not been resumed
at all since the peace. The sole obstacle has been the unprovoked war
of Algiers; and the sole remedy must be to bring that war to an end,
or to paKiate its effects. Its effects may, perhaps, be palliated by
ensuring our ships and cargoes destined for that sea, and by forming
a convention with the regency, for the ransom of our seamen, according to a fixed tariff. That tariff will, probably, be high, and the rate
of ensurance so settled, in the long run, as to pay for the vessels and
cargoes captured, and somethmg more. What proportion will be captured, nothing but experience can determine. Our commerce differs
from that of most of the nations with whom the predatory States are
in habits of war. Theirs is spread all over the face of the Mediterranean, and therefore must be sought for all over its face. Ours must
all enter at a strait only five leagues wide; so that their cruisers, taking
a safe and commanding position near the strait's mouth, may very
effectually inspect whatever enters it. So safe n station, with a certainty of receiving for their prisoners a good and stated price, may
tempt their cupidity to seek ovr vessels particularly. Nor is it certain that our seamen could be rnduced to engage in that navigation,
though with the security of Algerine faith that they would be hber-

24

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1785 TO 1801

ated on the payment of a fixed sum. The temporary deprivation of
liberty, perhaps chains, the danger of the peat, the perils of the engagement preceding their surrender, and possible delays of the ransom,
might turn elsewhere the choice of men, to whom all the rest of the
world is open. In every case, these would be embarrassments which
would enter into the merchant's estimate, and endanger his preference of foreign bottoms not exposed to them. And upon the whole,
this expedient does not f a our wish of a complete re-establishment
of om commerce in that sea.
A second plan might be, to obtain peace by purchasing it. For this
we have the example of rich and powerful nations, in this instance
counting their interest more than their honor. If, conforming to their
example, we determine to purchase a peace, it is proper to inquire
what that peace may cost. This being merely a matter of conjecture,
we can only compare together such opinions as have been obtained,
and from them form one for ourselves.
Mr. Wolf, a respectable Irishman, who had resided very long a t
Algiers, thought a peace might be obtained from that regency, and
the redemption of our captives included, for sixty or sevenhjTthouswd
pounds sterling. His character and opinion both, merited respect.
Yet his estimate being the lowest of all who have h a z d e d an oplnion
on this subject, one is apt to fear his judgment might have been
biased by the hope he entertained that the United States would charge
him with this negotiation.
Captain O'Brien, one of our captives, who had been in Algiers four
yeam and a half a t the date of his last lettef, a very sensible man, and
to whom we me indebted for very minute mformation, supposes that
peace alone might be bought for tahat sum, that is to say, for three
hundred and twenty-two thousand dollars.
The Tripoline ambassador, before mentioned, thought that peace
could be made with the three smaller Powers for ninety thousand
pounds sterhg, to which were to be added the e enses of the mission and other incidental expenses. But he cou d not answer for
Algiers: They would demand more. The ministers plenipotentiary
who conferred with him, had judged that as much must be paid to
Algiers as to the other three Powers together; and consequently,
that, according to this measure, the peace of Algiers would cost from
an hmdred to an hundred and twenty-five thousand pounds sterling;
or from four hundred and sixty to five hundred and seventy-five
thousand dollars.
The latter sum seemed to meet the ideas of the Count de Vergennes,
who, from a very long residence a t Constantinople, was a good judge
of whatever related to the Porte, or its dependencies.
A person whoso name is not free to be mentioned here, a native of
the continent of Europe, who had long lived, and still lives a t Algiers,
with whom the minister plenipotentiary of the United States a t Paris
had many and long conversafiops, and found his information full,
clear, and consistent, was of opizuon the peace of Algiers could not be
bought by the United States for less than a million of dollars. And
when that is paid, dl is not done. On the death of a Dey (and the
present one is between seventy and ~ i g h t yyears of age) respeotable
presents must be made to the successor, that he may recognise the
treaty;. and very often he takes the Iiberty of alterin it. Whm a
co11~ul~ssent or changed, new presents must be made. f these eventa

7'

f

WARS WlTH BARBARY POWERS

25

leave a considerable internal, occasion must be made of renewing
presents. And with all this they must see that we are in condition to
chastise an infraction of the treaty; consequently, some marine force
must be exhibited in their harbor from time to time.
The late peace of Spain with Algiers is snid to have cost from three
to five millions of dollars. Having received the money, they take the
vessels of that nation on the most groundless pretexts; counting, that
the same force, which bowed Spain to so hard a treaty, may break
it with impunity.
Their treaty with France, which had expired, was about two years
ago renewed for fifty years. The sum given a t the time of renewal
is not known. But presents we to be repeated every ten yearn, and
a tribute of one hundred thousand dollars to be annually paid. Yet
perceiving that Prance, embarrassed at home with her domest.ic
affairs, was less capable of acting abroad, they took six vessels of that
nation in the course of the last year, and retain the captives, forty-four
in number, in slavery.
It is the opinion of Captain O'Brien, that those nations are best
treated who pay a smaller sum in the beginning, and an annual
tribute afterwards. In this way he informs us that the Dutch,
Danes, Swedes, and Venetians pay to Algiers from twenty-four to
thirty thousand dollars a year, each; the two first in naval stores,
the two last chiefly in money. It is supposed that the peace of the
Barbary States costs Great Britian about sixty thousand guineas, or
two hundred and eighty thousand dollars a, year. But i t must be
noted that these facts cannot be authentically advanced; as, from a
principle of self condemnation, the governments keep them from the
public eye as much as possible.
Nor must we omit finally to recollect, that the Algerines, attentive
to reserve always a sufficient aliment for their piracies, will never
extend their peace beyond certain limits, and consequently that we
may find ourselves in the case of those nations to whom they refuse
peace at any price.
The third expedient is to repel force by force. Several statements
are hereto annexed of the naval force of Algiers, taken in 1785, 1786,
1787, 1788, and 1789, differing in small degrees, but concurring in the
main. From these it results, that they have usually had about nine
chebecks of from ten to thirty-six guns, and four alleys, which have
been reduced by losses to six chebecks and four gaif eys. They have a
forty gun frigate on the stocks, and expect two cruisers from the Grand
Se' nior. The character of their vessels is, that they are sharp
b$t and swift, but so light as not to stand the broadside of a good
frigate. Their guns are of different calibres, unskilfully pointed and
worked. The vessels illy mapoeuaed, but crowded with men-one
third Turks, the rest Moors, of determined bravery, and resting their
sole hopes on boarding. But two of these vessels belong to the
government, the rest being private property. If they come out of
harbor together, they separate immediately in quest of prey; and it is
said they were never known to act together in any instance. Nor do
they come out at all, when they know there are vessels cruisin
them. They perform three cruises a year, between the middfe of
A p d and November, when they unrig and lay up for the winter.
When not confined within the straits, the rove northwardly to the
channel, and westwardly to the Western Is ands.

r'

26

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1786 TO 1801

They are in peace a t present with France, Spain, England, Venice,
the United Netherlands, Sweden, and Denmark; and at war with
Russia, Austria, Portugal, Naples, Sardinia, Genoa, and Malta.
Should the United Statas propose to vindicate their commerce by
arms, they would, perhaps, think i t prudent to posess a force equal
to the whole of that which may be opposed to them. What that equal
force would be, w i l l belong to another department to say.
At the same time it might never be necessary to draw out the whole
a t once, nor perhaps any proportion of it, but for a small part of the
year; as it is reasonable to presume that n concert of operation might
be arranged among the powers a t war with the Barbary States, so as
that, each performing a tour of a given duration, and in given order, a
constant cruise during the eight temperate months of every year, may
be kept up before the harbor of Algiers, till the object of such operations be completely obtained. Portugal has singly, for several years
past, kept up such a cruise before the straits of Gibraltar, and by
that means has confined the Algerines closely within. But two of
their vessels have been out of the straits in the last five years. Should
.Portugal effect a peace with them, as has been apprehended for some
time, the Atlantic will immediately become the principal scene of
their piracies; their peace with Spain having reduced the profits of
their Mediterranean cruises below the expenses of equipment.
Upon the whole, i t rests with Congress to decide between war,
tribute, and ransom, as the means of re-establishing our Mediterranean
commerce. If war, they will consider how far our own resources shall
be called forth, and how far they will enable the Executive to engage,
in the forms of the constitution, the co-operation of other Powers.
If tribute or ransom, it will rest with them to limit and provide the
amount; and with the Executive, obse~vingthe same constitutional
forms, to make arrangements for employing it t o the best advantage.

NAVAL OPEBATIONS FROM 1786 TO 1801
[Enclosure]

To the Congress of the United States from Richard O'Brien, Algiers

CITYOF ALGIERS,
April 28,1791.
MOSTHONORED
SIRS: I t affords the Americans in captivity some
consolation to hear that his excellency the President has drawn the
attention of Congress towards Barbary affairs, and to consider of the
decrease of American commerce to the Mediterranean.
One of your most unfortunate subjects takes the liberty of humbly
submitting to your consideration the following particulars on Barbary
affairs.
I n December last, the Philanthropic Society sent orders to Europe
to t for a peace with this regency; these orders came to Monsieur
~ a t ~ofnMarseilles,
,
who commissioned Monsieur Parnet, a French
merchant in Algiers, and agent for the chamber of commerce, Marseilles. Monsieur Parnet, made application to the Dey and ministry
on this important subject, but was not enabled to obtain any answer
of importance until the 18th of December, when he immediately
despatched a vessel for Marseilles. Monsieur Parnet was authorized
by his orders to treat for the ransom of the Americans; but as our
redemption had been ascertained the 7th of last July, by Abraham
Bushara and Dininio, for the sum of 17,225 Algerine sequins, nearly
equal to 34,450 Spanish dollars, Monsieur Parnet could only return
for answer, that our ransom was finally ascertained, and is so recorded
by the regency a t the above sum. Monsieur Parnet informed me
that his orders relative to the peace did not authorize him to make the
ministry any promises for them to use their influence with the Dey:
for if he made any promises, he must fulfil them, and by his not being
fully empowered, he could not take the proper channel for laying the
foundation of the peace, and that the Dey signified that, when the
Americans made good their agreement of the 7th last July, that then
he would consider of the peace.
I take the liberty, honored sirs, to observe, that there is no doing
any business of importance in this country, without Grst palming the
ministry; and by taking this proper channel, be assured, honored sirs,
that there is no great difficulty to carry any point.
I take the liberty of explaining that the Algerines had great reason
to think that the Americans considered them in a very singular light,
by sending orders, three different times, relative to ascertaining our
ransom and affairs that had been fixed on a few months past; then to
empower Monsieur Parnet, supposing the Algerines would lower their
rice, or deviate, in any respect, from the agreement made with
gushara and Dininio.
Be assured, honored sirs, that Monsieur Parnet found this to be a
very delicate subject to treat of, and by what I now hint to you,
honored sirs, your superior wisdom will perceive the impropriety of
an further propositions relative to ascertaining our ransom.
'$he prime minister sent to me, and desired that, when I wmte m
country, to write, that, if the Americans did not keep to their w o r z
on affairs so trifling as that of our release, that there was no great
dependence to be put in America, in affairs of more importance,
alluding to the peace. Be assured, honored sirs, that the prime
minister is a friend to America, and was the only one of the Algerine
ministry that countenanced Mr. Lamb, in 1786.

writing to Mr. James Simpson, a t Gibraltar, and Mr. Simpson, supposing the orders originated in Congress, wrote to Bushara and
Dininio, to have our redemption ascertained with the regency; so
that, if ever we are to be redeemed, i t must be through the channel
of Bushara and Dininio, as the Dey, in his answer to Monsieur Parnet,
signified fully as much, snd as they are Algerine subjects, the Dey and
ministry of course will determine the affair in their favor.
At present there are but 700 Christian slaves in Algiers, and the
two-thirds of these are deserters from the Spanish garrison of Oran ;
and as the captives are much wanted to do the public work, the
regency does not seem inclinable to permit slaves to be redeemed on
any terms: for without the slaves, those people could not well fit out
their cruisers.
I n 1786, there were three thousand Christian slaves in Algiers; but
the Spaniards, Neapolitans, and other nations redeeming thew people,
and the pest, that great storm of mortality, which happened m this
city in 1787-8, which carried off nine hundred Christian captives amongst this number were six Americans - our redemption is but
trifling higher than the terms on which the Spaniards and other nations
redeemed their people, and, since those redemptions and the pest, the
price of slaves is continually rising.
Those lads that are pages to the Dey, were solicited to turn Mahometans, but they would not, which makes their prices somewhat exorbitant.
When I consider the fatal consequences that would happen to
America, if the Portuguese should make a peace with this regency,
i t makes the greatest impression on me of any thing whatsoever that
can possibly occur to a patriotic mind; and although at present the
Portuguese keep up a fleet of cruisers to protect their own commerce,
yet experience shews (by Spain) that t.hey may be negotiating a
peace underhand.
Since my captivity, the Portuguese have made two attempts to
try to obtain a peace, and fortunate (thank God) for America they
did not succeed. Should they succeed, America would be put to a
vast expense to build and fit out eight or ten cruisers; and to keep this
squadron in Europe for a few years, would he attended with a vast
expense, which Ainerica could not vell afford. Should the Portuguese make a pence, and America to abandon the Straits to the
Algerines, the alarm would be so great that no American property
would be ensured under twenty-five percent. The first cruise, they
would go as far as the Western Islands, and, by being acquamted with
the navigation that far, would be induced to go on to the coasts of
America; then, honored sirs, what would be the fatal consequences what would be the alarm! and it is well known that there is nothing
to be derived by being a t war with the Barbary States; but, by being
at peace, many adt-antages, and extended and beneficial commerce.
I t has cost Spain full four and a half millions 01 dollars to make
their eace, and redeem their people, notwithstanding Spnin acted
somet ing wisely not to be the dupe of all the commercial nations of
Europe.
Honored sirs, in my opinion, the United States may obtain a peace
with this regency for tiity or sixty thousand pounds sterling, all
expenses included; that is, if the affair is well managed; and with

Tunis for fifteen thousand pounds sterlin . I n making a peace with

is a tribut
State to t b regency, and under its influence.
Instead o America giving a sum of money for the peace, I believe
this regency would find it to their interest to take, in lieu, maritme
dares, masts, yards, plank, tar, pitch, turpentine, scantling, for
constructing crmsers; and, by giving maritime stores, I believe the
peace would not cost America twenty thousand pounds sterling.
Or to purchase one hundred and fifty or two hundred passports of
the regency, at a certain fixed price, and tor these, to pay a certain
sum every two years, and those that wanted those passports, that
traded to Europe, to purchase them of the Government, so that the
passports would defray the expenses incurred in obtaining the peace.
I have frequently, these four years, had some hints of these subjects
communicated to the Algerine ministry, and ha.d favorable answers
which I wrote to the American ambassadors in Europe.
The present time is favorable for America to try for the peace;
and I further take the liberty, honored sirs, to observe, that those
nations, the Dutch, Danes, Swedes, and Venetians, that pay a tribute
annually, that their peace is on a more solid and lasting basis than
those nations that give large sums for making the peace, and not to be
tributary: for i t is the annual tribute those nations pay the Algemes
is the bait that secures their peace, and not any sentiment of national
honor or regard to treaties, but for their own interest in being supplied
with naval and military stores.
Most honored sirs, we hope you will consider what our sufferings
must have been in this country, during that trying period of nearly
six years captivity; but we now hope that you wiU give such powers
to your representatives in Europe, so as to finally extricate your
fourteen unfortunate subjects from their present state of bondage
and adversity.

SIR YOUare appointed by the President of the United States to
go to the Court of Morocco for the purpose of obtaining from the new
emperor a recognition of our Treaty with his father. As it is thought
best that you should go in some definite character, that of Consul
has been adopted, and you consequently receive a Commission as
Consul for the United States in the dominions of the Emperor of
Morocco, which having been issued during the recess of the Senate
will of course expire a t the end of their next Session. I t has been
thought best however not to insert this limitation in the Commission
5s being unnecessary, and i t might perhaps embarrass. Before the
end of the next Session of the Senate it is expected the objects of your
mission will be accomplished.
Lisbon b e i i the most convenient port of correspondence between
us and Morocco, sufficientauthority will be given to Col. Humphreys,
Resident for the United States at that place, over funds in Amsterdam
for the objects of our mission. On him therefore ou will draw for
the sums herein adowed, or such parts of them as s aU be neceastq.
To that port too you had better proceed in the first vessel which shall

thence to Morocco.
On your asrival in Morocco sound your ground, and know how
things stand at present. Your former voyage there having put you
in possession of the characters through whom this may be done, who
may best be used for approaching the Emperor and effecting your
purpose, you are left to use your own knowledge to the best advantage.
The object being merely to obtain an acknowledgment of the
treaty, we rely that you will be able to do this, giving very moderate
presents. As the amount of these will be drawn into precedent on
future similar repetitions of them, it becomes important. Our distance, our seclusion from the ancient world, it's politics and usages,
our agricultural occupations and habits, our poverty, and lastly our
determination to prefer war in all cases to tribute under any form and
to any people whatever, will furnish you with topics for opposing
and refusing high or dishonoring pretentions, to which may be added
the advantages their people will derive from our commerce, and their
Sovereign from the duties laid on whatever we extract from that

writing by every possible occasion, detailing to us particularly your
conferences either private or public, and the persons with whom they
are held.
We think that Francisco Chiappe has merited well of the United
States by his care of their peace and interests. He has sent an account of disbursements for us amounting to 394 dollars. Do not
recognize the account, because we are unwilling, by doing thrat,to
give him a colour for presenting larger ones hereafter, for expenses
which it is impossible for us to scrutinize or controul. Let him
understand that o w laws oppose the application of public money so
informally; but in your presents, treat him handsomely, so as not
only to cover this demand, but go beyond it with a liberality which
may fix him deeply in our interests. The place he holds near the
Emperor renders his friendship peculiarly important: Let us have
nothing further to do with his brothers or any other person. The
money which would make one good friend, divided among several will
produce no attachment.
The Emperor has intimated that he expects an Ambassador from
us. Let h m understand that this may be a custom of the old world,
but it is not ours: that we never sent an Ambassador to any nation.
You are to be allowed from the day of your departure till your
return 166% dollars a month for your time and expenses, adding
thereto your passage money and sea stores going and coming.

succeeded by M i Hassan who after having ordered the Aga to be

not desire nor recomend my eing sent there a t first as if by order of
Congress for being Merchant I could go over as such and on the perticu1ar business of my house for which I can easily get permission from
the Dey and be well received by Soliman, they both already know my
hearty desire to bring about a Concdliation and this would naturaly
be our topic of Conversation; I should then let him know that the
few slaves they have of ours were picked up by accident when they
apprehended no danger but that they must expect no more now we
are on our guard, and that the profits tbey can have in continuing a
war like this can never be equal to the solid advantages the must
reap from making a peace with us on such terms as we cod afford
besides that I know his Excellency wishes to do me service he could
never have so good an opportunity as the present by enabling me to
have the honour of bringing about a peace between him and the
United States: This language and what else your Excellency might
think more proper to advise I should make use of to him and as he
understands Spanish very well I should not require. an Interpreter,
which might make him less cautious to develope his rmnd to me on the
business As no Nation has been able to make peace with this Regency without paying for it in some manner or other we of courso need not expect
to do i t for Nothing but it may be done in the manner the [United]
States will suffer least by it; some armed Vessels for Corsairs and such
Naval stores as are the produce of America would I dont doubt be
made to do; but a visit to Algiers will be necessary before anything can
be said on the business with certint at which time our prisioners there
could also be thought of - Sho d your Excellency approve of m y
part of what has struck me on this important business and honour me
with your Confidence I should immediately go to Algiers and purchass
some wheat for this market, when I should have an opportunity of
informing my self pretty fully without discovering any such intention
after which I shall comunicate such advices as may be laid before
Congress and if in the business you chuse to correspond in cyphers a

Russian war is ended; the seige of Oran continues with very little

America.

-

Sometime before the Death of the Late Emperor, which happened
on the 11" of April 1790, his Son Muley Yezid took refuge in a Sanctuary near Tetuan, t o avoid the resentment of his father, who ordered
Muley Slama a younger Son by the Same Mother to invest the
Sanctuary, which he was afraid to violate in a more direct manner,
So as to Cut off all communication between it and the Camtry, and
consequently in the end compel Muley Yezid from the want of Subsistance to Surrender himself to his father, before this could be
effected, the Emperor died at Saffy, and the Prince quitted the
Sanctuary having been proclaimed his Successor in the North, as well
as in the Cities of Fez, Mequinez, and Morocco, while Muley Slema,
by one of these changes of fortune not uncommon in his Country, to
escape the power of his brother, placed himself in the Sanctuary
where he Still remains. The new Emperor, who has sssumed the name of Mabomet El
Mehedy El Yezid has had pressing Solicitations to appear at the great

Petition of Prisoners at Algiers

The Petition of the Prisoners st &em, Sheweth That we were Captured nearly Seven Years ago b Cruisers belonging to the Regency of Algiers, while we were avigating Vessels
belonging to Citizens of the United States. That we were for a Considerable time flattered with the expectation held u to us that we
would be redeemed from Captivity, as soon as it Co d be done Consistant with propriety, and the mterest of our Country. That to
Effect this Redemption M' John Lamb was sent to Algiers on the
part of the United States, and that he entered into an agreement with
the Regency at Algiers for our ransom, in consequence of which, the
terms were recorded on the Books of the Regency, But M' Lamb
never returned to fulfill them by the payment of the Ransom Money,
though he promised in the Name of the United States to do it in four
Months. That we understand severd persons have since been employed to make inquiries whether the Ransom agreed upon by Mr
Lamb, might not be reduced, but all attempts of that sort have hitherto proved inefectud, the Regency declaring that the Contract made
by the Agent on the part of the United States ought to be discharged That we were for some time supplied with such sums of Money as
served, together with the prospect of Redemption held up to us, to
alleviate in some degree the rigor of our Captivity, but those supplies
have Ceased for a Considerable time, during which we have been
reduced to the Utmost distress, and we are Compelled in a great
Measure to depend on the Charity of Transient people That owing to the Meioncholy situation to which we are reduced,
one of us, James Hormet, has been deprived of his senses, and Confined in a Dungeon, the rest remain destitute almost of all the necessaries of lfe, and in this Deplorable situation we have resisted any
temptations to Enter into the service of the Regency, that might
hereafter be attended with Repentance or Remorse, trusting in the
Justice and Humanity of Congress that we shall never be reduced to
the Necessity of abandoning our Country and our Religion Your Most humble petrtioners further pray you will Consider
what our sufferings must have been for Nearly seven Years Captivity,

To Admiral JOHN
PAUL
JONES.

PHILADELPHIA
June 1. 1792'.

SIR The President of the United States having thought proper

to appoint you Commissioner for treating with the Dey and Govern-

ment of Algiers on the subjects of Peace and ransom of our captives,
I have the honor to enclose you the Commissions, of which Mr Thomas
Pinckney now on his way to London as our Minister Plenipotentiary
there, d l be the bearer. Supposing that there exists a disposition
to thwart our negotiations with the algerines, and that this would
be very practicable, we have thought i t adviseable that the knowledge of this appointment should rest with the President, Mr Pinckney
and myself: for which reason you will perceive that the Commissions
are all in my own hand writing. for tho same reason, entire secrecy
is recommended to you, and that you so cover from the public your
departure and destination, as that they may not be conjectured or
noticed; and at the same time that you set out after as short delay as
your affairs will possibly permit.
In order to enable you to enter on this business -4th full information, it will be necessary to give you a history of what has passed.
On the 25. July 1785. the Schooner Maria,Captn Stevens, belonging to a Mr Foster of Boston, was taken off Cape St Vincents by an
Algerine Cruiser; and five days afterwards, the Ship Dauphin, Capt?
Obrian, belonging to MessTs Irvins of Philadelphia was taken by
another about 50. Ieagues westward of Lisbon. These vessels with
their cargoes and crews, twenty one persons in number, were carried
into Algiers. M' John Lamb, a pointed Agent for treating of peace
between the United States an$ the Government of Ahgem, was
ready to set out from France on that business, when M' Adams and
myself heard of these two captures. The ransom of prisoners, being
a case not existing when our powers were prepared, no provision had
been made for it. We thought however we ought to endeavor to
ransom our countrymen, without waiting for orders; but at the same
time, that, acting without authority, we should keep within the
lowest price which had been given by any other Nation. We therefore gave a supplementory instruction to M' Lamb to ransom our
captives, if it could be done for 200. dollars a man, as we knew that
three hundred French captives had been just ransomed by the
Mathurins, at a price very little above this sum. E e proceeded to
Algiers: but his mission proved fruitless. He wrote us word from
thence, that the Dey asked 59.496. dollars for the 21 captives, and that

WARS WITI1 BAHL'ARY POWERS
it was not probable he would abate much from that price: but he never
intimated an idea of agreeing to give it. As he has never settled the
accounts of his mission, no further information has been received.
I t has been said that he entered into a positive stipulation with the
Dey to pay for the prisoners the price above mentioned, or something near it; and that he came away with an assurance to return
with the money. We cannot believe the fact true; and if i t were,
we disavow i t totally, as far beyond his powers. We have never
disavowed it formally, because it has never come to our knowledge
with any degree of certainty.
I n Peb? 1787. I wrote to Congress to ask leave to employ the
Mathurins of France in ransoming our captives, and on the 19. of
Septem' I received their orders to do so, and to call for the money
from our bankers at Amsterdam as soon as it could be furnished. I t
was long before they could furnish the money, and, as soon as they
notified that they could, the business was put into train by the
General of the Mathurins, not with the appearance of acting for the
United States or with their knowledge, but merely on the usual
ground of charity. This expedient was rendered abortive by the
Revolution of France, the derangement of ecclesiastical orders there,
and the revocation of church property, before any proposition perhaps
had been made in form by the Mathurins to the Dey of Algiers. _
I have some reason to believe that Mr Eustace, while in Spain
endeavored to engage the Court of Spain to employ their Mathurins
in this same business, but whether they actually moved in it, or not,
I have never learned
We have also been told that a M': S i p s o n of Gibraltar, by the
direction of the Mess~"ulke1eys of Lisbon, contracted for the ransom
of our prisoners (then reduced by death and ransom to 14) a t 34,792
28/38 dollars. By whose orders they did it we could never learn.
I have suspected it was some association in London, which finding
the prices far above their conception, did not go through with their
purpose, which probably had been merely a philanthropic one: be
this as i t may, i t was without our authority or knowledge.
Again, Mr Cathalan, our Consul a t Marseilles, without any instruction from the Government, and actuated merely, as we presume,
by a willingness to do something agreeable, set on foot another
negociation for their redemption; which ended in nothing.
These several volunteer interferences, though undertaken with
good intentions, run directly counter to our plan; which was to apold
the appearance of any purpose on our part ever to ransom our caphves,
and by that semblance of neglect, to reduce the demands of the algerines to such a price as might make it hereafter less their interest to
pursue our Citmens than any others. On the contrary they have
supposed all these propositions, directly or indirectly, came from us:
they inferred from thence the greatest anxiety on our part, where we
had been endeavoring to make them suppose there was none; kept
up their demands for our captives at the highest prices ever paid
by any Nation; and thus these charitable, though unauthorized
interpositions, have had the double effect of lengthening the chains
they were meant to break, and of making us at last set a much higher
rate of ransom, for our Citizens present and future, than we probably
should have obtained, if we had been left alone to do our own work,
in our own way. Thus stands this business then a t present. A

33

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1785 TO 1801

f o m d bmgain, as I am informed, being registered in the books of the
former Dey, on the part of the Bulkeleys of Lisbon, which the
Buppose to be obhgatarg on us, but which is to be utterly disavowed:
as having never been authorized by us, nor its source even known to us.
In 1790. this subject was laid before Congress fully, and a t the late
Session monies have been provided, and authority given to proceed
to the ransom of our captive Citizens at Algiers, provided it shall not
exceed a given sum, and pro$ded also a peace shall be previously
negotiated within certain b u t s of expense. And in consequence of
these proceedings your mission has been decided on by the President.
Since then no ransom is to take place without a peace, you will of
course take up first the negotiation of peace, or if you find ~t better
that peace and ransom should be treated of together, you will take
care that no agreement for the latter be concluded, unless the former
be established befoye, or .in the same instant.
As to the condit~ons,it is understood that no peace can be made
with that Government but for a larger sum of money to be paid at
once for the whole time of its duration, or for a smaller one to be
annually paid. The former plan we entireIy refuse, and adopt the
latter. We have also understood that peace might be bought cheaper
with naval stores than with money: but we will not furnish them naval
stores, because we think it not right to furnish them means which we
know they will employ to do wrong, and because there might be no
economy in it, as to ourselves in the end, as it would increase the
expense of that coercion which we may in future be obliged to practice
towards them. The only question then is, what sum of money will
we agree to pay them annmUy for peace?
By a letter from CaptF Obrian, [dated 27 September 17911 a copy of
which you receive herewith, we have his opinion that a peace could be
purchased with money for £60,000 sterling, or with nu& stores for
100,000. dollars. An annual payment equivalent to the k t , would be
£3000. sterling, or 13,500. dollars, the interest of the sum in gross.
If we could obtain it for as small a sum as the second in money, the
annual payment e uivalent to it would be 5000. dollars. In an other
part of the same etter Capt? Obrian says "if maritime stores and
two light cruisers given and a tribute p a d in maritime stores every
two years amounting to 12,000. dollars in America", a peace can be
had. The p f t of stores and cruisers here supposed, converted into an
annual equvalent, may be stated at 9000. dollars, and adding to i t
half the biennial sum, would make 15,000. dollars to be annually paid.
You will of course use your best endeavors to get it a t the lowest sum
practicable, whereupon I shall only say, that we should be pleased with
10,000. dollars, contented with 15,000., think 20,000. a very hard
bargain, yet go as far as 25,000. if it be impossible to get it for less;
but not a copper further, this being fixed by law as the utmost limit:
these are meant as annual sums. If you can put off the first annual
payment to the end of the first year, you may
exceeding that in presents to be paid down: but
to be m d e in hand, that and the presents
25,000. dollars.
And here we meet a d%cult4y, arising from the small degree of information we have respecting the Barbary States. Tunis is said to be
tributary to Algiers; but whether the effect of this be that peace being
made with Algiers, is of course with the Tunisians without separate

I

W&S

treaty, or separate price, is what we know not. If i t be possible to
have it placed on this footing so much the better. At any event it will
be necessary to stipulate with Algiers that her influence be interposed
as strongly as possible with Tunis, whenever we shall proceed to treat
with the latter; which cannot be till information of the event of your
negotiation, and another Session of Congress.
As to the articles and form of the treaty in general, our treaty with
Marocco was so well digested that I enclose you a copy of that to be
the model with Algiers, as nearly as it can be obtained, only inserting
the clause with respect to Tunis.
The ransom of the captives is next to be considered. they are now
thirteen in number, to wit, Richard Obrian, and Isaac Stevens, Captains, Andrew Montgomery and Alexander Forsyth, Mates, Jacob
Tessanier, a French passenger, William Patterson, Philip Sloan,
Peleg Lorin, James Hull, James Cathcart, George Smith, John
Gregory, James Hermit, seamen. I t has been a fixed principle with
Congress to establish the rate of ransom of American Captives with
the Barbary states at as low a point as possible, that it may not be the
interest of those States to go in quest of our Citizens in preference to
those of other Countries. Had it not been for the danger it would
have brought on the residue of our seamen, by exciting the cupidity
of those rovers against them, our Citizens now in Algiers wouId have
been long ago redeemed without regard to price. The mere money
for this particular redemption neither has been, nor is an object with
any body here. I t is from the same regard to the safety of our seamen
at large that they have now restrained u s from any ransom unaccompanied with peace: this being secured, we are led to consent to terms
of ransom, to which otherwise our government would never have consented; that is to say, to the terms stated by Captq Obrian in the following passage of the same letter - "by giving the Minister of the
Marine (the present Deys favorite) the sum of 1,000. sequins. I
would stake my life that we would be ransomed for 13,000. sequins &
all expenses included". Extravagant as this sum is, we will, under the
secunty of peace in future, go so far; not doubting a t the same time
that you will obtain it as much lower as possible, and not indeed without a hope that a lower ransom will be practicable from the assurances
given us in other letters from CaptWbrian, that prices are likely to be
abated by the present Dey, and particularly with us, towards whom
he has been represented as well disposed. You will consider this sum
therefore, say 27,000. dollars, as your ultimate limit, including ransom,
duties, and gratifications of every kind.
As soon as the ransom is completed, you will be pleased to have the
captives well cloathed, and sent home at the expense of the United
States, with as much economy as will consist with their reasonable
comfort.
I t is thought best that Mc Pinckney, our minister at London should
be the confidential channel of communication between us. He is
enabled to answer your draughts for money within the limits before
expressed: and as this will be b redrawing on Amsterdam, you must
settle with him the number o days a f t e ~sight a t which your bills
shall be payable in London so as to give him time, in the mean while,
to draw the monev from Amsterdam.
We shall be anxious to know as soon and as often as possible, your
prospeats in these negociations. You will receive herewith a cypher

9

40

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 17'85 TO 1801

which will enable you to make them with safety. London and Lisbon
(where Col. Humphreys will forward my letters) will be the safest and
best ports of communication. I also enclose two seperate commissions
for the objects of peace and ransom. To these is added a commission
to you as Consul for the United States a t Algiers, on the possibility
that it might be useful for you to remain there till the ratification of
the treaties shall be returned from hence; though you are not to delay
till their return, the sending the Captives home, nor the necessary
payments of money within the limits before prescribed. Should you
be willing to remain there, even after the completion of tho business,
as Consul for the United States, you will be free to do so, giving me
notice, that no other nomination may be made. These Commiss~ons,
being issued during the recess of the Senate, are in force, by the
Constitution, only till the next Session of the Senate; but their renewal then is SO much a matter of course, and of necessity, that you
may consider that as certain, and proceed without interniption. I
have not mentioned this in the Commissions, because it is in all cases
surplusage, and because it might be difFicult of explanation to tbose
to whom you are addressed.
The allowance for d l your expenses and time (exclusive of the ransom, price of peace, duties, presents, maintenance and transportation
of the Captives) is a t the rate of 2000. dollars a year, to commence
from the day on which you shall set out for Algiers, from whatever
place you mag take your departure. The particular objects of peace
and ransom once out of toheway, the 2000. dollars annually are to go
in satisfaction of time, services, and expences of every kind, whether
you act as Consul or Commissioner.
As the duration of this peace cannot be counted on with certainty,
and we look forward to the necessity of coercion by cruises on their
coast, to be kept up during the whole of their cruising season, you will
be pleased to inform yourself, as minutely as possible, of every circumstance which may influence or guide us in undertaking and conducting such an operation, making your communications by safe
opportunities.
I must recommend to your particular notice Captg Obrian, one of
the Captives, from whom we have received a great deal of useful
information. The zeal which he has displayed under the trying circumstances of his present situation has been very distinguished, you
will find him intimately acquainted with the manner in which and
characters with whom business is to be done there, and perhaps he
may be an useful instrument to you, especially in the outset of your
undertaking, which will require the utmost caution, and the best
information. He will be able to give you the characters of the European Consuls there, tho' you will probably not think it prudent to
repose confidence in any of them.
Should you be able successfully to accomplish the objects of your
mission in time to convey notice of i t to us as early as.possible during
the next Session of Congressl which meets in the beginmug of November
and rises the 4. of March, i t would have a very pleasing effect.

J ~ n e11.1792.
SIR Congress having furnkhed me with means for procuring peace,
and ransomug our captiv? c~tizensfrom the government of Algiers,
I have thought it best, whde you are engaged at Marocco, to appoint
Admiral Jones to proceed to Algiers, and therefore have sent him s
Commission for establishing peace, another for the ransom of our
ca tives, and a third to act there as Consul for the United States, and
f u 8 in~tructionsare given in a letter from the Secretary of State to
him, of all which papers, Mr Pinckney, now proceeding to London as
our Minister Plenipotentiary there, is the bearer, as he is also of this
letter. It is sometime however since we have heard of Admiral Jones,
and as, in the event of any accident to him, it might occasion an
injurious delay, were the business t~ await new Commissions from
hence, I have thought i t best, in such an event, that Mr Pinckne
should forward to you all the papers addressed to admiral Jones, wit
this letter, signed by myself, giving you authority on receipt of those
papers to consider them as addressed to you,. and to proceed under
them in every respect as if your name stood m each of them in the
place of that of John Paul Jones. You will of course finish the business
of your mission to Mnsocco with all the dispatch practicable, and then
proceed to Algiers on that hereby confided to you, where this letter
with the Commissions addressed to Admiral Jones, and an explanation
of circumstances, will doubtless procure you credit as acting in the
name and on the behalf of the United States, and more especially when
you shall efficaciously prove your authority by the fact of making, on
the spot, the pa ents you shall stipulate. With full confidence in
the prudence a n g t e g r i t y with which you will fuliill the objects of the
present mission, I give to this letter the effect of a Commission and
full powers, by hereto subscribing my name this eleventh day of June
one thousand seven hundred and ninety two.

To CoI. DAVIDHUMPHREYG
SIR,The deaths of Admiral Paul Jones first, and afterwards of M?
Barclay, to whom the mission to Algiers explained in the enclosed
papers [letter dated June 1, 17921 was successively confided, have led
the President to desire you to undertake the execution of i t in person.
These papers, being copies of what had been delivered to them will
serve a0 your guide. But M' Barclay having been also charged with a
mission to Morocco, it will be necessary
- to -e v e-you some trouble with
respect to that also;
Mr Nathaniel Cutting. the Bearer hereof, is dispatched s~eciallv.
first to receive from Mc f i c h e y in London a'ny papers or infohatioh;
which his Agency in the Al erine Business may have enabled him to
communicate to you: He WI% then proceed to deliver the whole to you,
and accompany and aid you in the character of Secretary I t is thought necessary that you should, in the first instance settle
Mr Barclay's accounts respecting the Morocco mission, which will
probably render it necessary that ou should go to Gibralter. The
communications you have had wit Mr Barclay in this mission will

g

43

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS

assist you in your endeavours a t a settlement. You know the sum
received by M' Barclay on that account, and we wish as exact a statement as can be made of the manner in which it has been laid out, and
what part of it's proceeds are now on hand. You will be pleased to
make an Inventory of these proceeds now existing. If they or any
art of them can be used for the Algerine mission, we would have you
all means apply them to that use, debiting the Algerioe fund, and
crediting that of Morocco with the amount of such application. If
they cannot be so used, then dispose of the perishable articles to the
best advantage, and if you can sell those not perishable for what they
cost, do so, and what you cannot so sell, deposite in any safe place
under your own power. In this last stage of the Business return us an
exact account I"! of the specific articles remaining on hand for that
mission, and their value. 2"g of it's cash on hand. 3 d of any money
which may be due to or from Mr Barclay or any other person on account of this mission, and take measures for replacing the clear
balance of cash in the hands of Messr! W. & I. 'CVillinks and NichQ&
Jacob Van Staphorsts and Nubbard This matter being settled, you will be pleased to proceed on the
mission to Algiers. This you will do by the way of Madrid, if you
think any information you can get from Mr Carmichael, or any other
may be an equivalent for the trouble, expense and delay of the journey.
If not, proceed in whatever other way you please to Algiers Proper powers and Credentials for you addressed to that government
are herewith enclosed. - The Instructions first given to Admiral
Paul Jones are so full that no others need be added, except a qualification in one single article, to wit: Should that Government h a l l y
reject peace on the terms in money, to which you are authorized to go,
you may offer to make the first payments for peace and that for ransom
m nuvd stores, reserving the right to make the subsequent annual
payments in money You are to be allowed your travelling expences, your salary as
Minister Resident in Portugal going on. Those expences must be
debited to the Algerine Mission, and not carried into your ordinary
account as Resident. Mr Cutting is allowed one hundred Dollars a
month, and his expenses, which as soon as he joins you, will of course
be consolidated with yours. We have made choice of him as parhcuIarly qualified to aid under your direction in the matters of account,
with which he is well acquainted. He receives here an advance of
One thousand Dollars by a draught on our Bankers in Holland in whose
hands the fund is deposited. This and aJl other sums furnished him,
to be debited to the Algerine fund. I inclose you a letter to our Bankers giving you complete authority over these funds, which ou had
better send with your f i s t Draught, though I send a copy o it from
hence b another opportunity Tlis usiness belng done, you will be pleased to return to Lisbon,
and to keep yourself and us thereafter well informed of the transactions
in Morocco, and as soon as you shall find that the succession to that
Government is settled and stable so that we may know to whom a
Commissioner may be addressed, be so good as to give us the information that we may take measures in consequence.

NAVAL OPEBATIONS FROM 1785 TO 1801
To Secretary of State from James Simpson, U. S. Consul, Gibraltar

GIBRALTAR
Is! June 1793 SIR: Contrary Winds having detain'd the Vessel this goes by,
affords me an opportunity of adding to my advices under 224 last
Month, forwarded by same conveyance, the intelligence we have
since received of the American Schooner Lark Captc Pulling from
Carthagena, having been captured off Cape de Gat, by an Algerine
Row Boat; - fortunately the Master & Crew escap'd in their Boat,
and landed in Spain. By our latest advices Muley Soliman remained a t Rhabat - most
of the Provinces sent him deputies, and he has been encouraged to
send part of his Army forward to Shauia or Tremecena, in order to
give the Alcaydes Ben Assar & Bellaroni an opportunity of joining
him if they should be inclined to do so - those Men have for some
time back lived in a state of Independency, and not taken part with
any of the contending Princes When Spain supported Muley Ishem in opposition to Yazid &
Islema they had no communication with any other part of the Empire
but that under his dominion - permission has lately been given for
their Vessels to trade as before to all the Ports, and I have it from the
best authority that the Court of Madrid will be one of the first to
send an Ambassador to Soliman, so soon as he can establish himself in
Morrocco.
The report of the Toulon Fleet having sailed has not been confirmed. The allied Army has enter'd France - by our latest advices they
were before Cond6 and Valenciennes. [SDA. CL, Gihmltar, Vol. I, April 1791-Dec. 1795.1

LISBON224 Septr 1793
SIR Col1 Humphreys with M Cutting embarked the 17" Inst: on
bg a Swedish Vessel called yVostillion commanded by Ab* Herbst
bound first for Gibralter. - The Algerine Corsairs are (unfortunately for us) more at Liberty just at this time than heretofore, the
Portugueze Ships of War, which were stationed on that Coast, being
obliged to quit it, to follow the orders of their Masters the English;
it is therefore to be feared that this circumstance may increase the
dBculties of the proposed negotiation, as the Algerines only wanted
this obstacle removed to have become Masters long ere this of many
of our Vessels and fellow-Citizens - Coll H. has probably informed
you that an American Vessel was taken by the Aulgerines the 18tP
UltQ& that the Men fortunately escaped in thee boat to the opposite
Shore near Malaga, had the men been taken, it E more than probable
that the great object in view would have been defeated, the Algerines
were in an American Vessel which they had taken some time before
and armed for the purpose, the Crew of this Vessel had also effected
their escape in the same way. - An American Vessel from Boston
sailed from this Port last Week bound for Malaga, it is of the utmost
importance that She also she escape, for should one other American
Crew fall into the Dey's hands, our Friend's means would be totally
inade uate, & his mission of c o v e fruitless. Un er the most favourable c~rcumstance.~,
with his present means,
We have no great reason to be very sangme of his success - The

1

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS
extreme ignorance and imprudent conduct of one of the precursors on
the same errand, have great1 magnified the expectations and demands of the Dey, and the tri ute paid by other Nations far exceeds
the Sum prescribed by the U. S. - Fortunately for America She
has every thing possible to hope from the present Agent, who goes
with a heart tremblingly alive to the Sufferings of the unfortunate
Captives, and who also possesses every other reqmsite conducive to
the success of such an Enterprize; but when we consider that he has
to treat with a rapacious Despot who is probably actuated solely by
self-interest, and restrained only by fear, that it is palpably for the
interest of all the European maritime Nations that We should be
excluded from a share m the mediterranean trade, and therefore
that all the Barbary Powers should be our Enemies; I would hope,
whatever may be the issue of this negociation, that my Countrymen
will give Col! Humphreys all the credit due to a Man who has done all
that Man can do. - No man is more thoroughly convinced than I
am of the importance,.and vast c o ~ e r c ~advantages
al
to the U. S.
of Amy of a free Mechterranean Navigation, but I am by no means
convinced that these advantages can possibly be secured to Us in our
present Situation; the faith of Puates - whose only support is plunder,
and who have hitherto contemned all those times and obligations
which clash wth their interest, and we sometimes bind more civilized
Despots, - seems to me to be but a feeble dependence on which to
place a large Stake.
When wc can appear in the Ports of the various Powers, or on the
Coast, of Barbary, with Ships of such force as to convince those
nations that We are able to protect our trade, and to compel them if
necessary to keep faith with Us, then, and not before, We may probably secure a large share of the Medit-rade, which would largely
and speedily compensate the U. S. for the Cost of a maritime force
amply sufficient to keep all those Pirates in Awe, and also make it
their interest to keep faith. We are here almost as ignorant of what the belligerent Powers are
doing as if We were in the moon, being excluded from all communication with France, and having only the garbled accounts in the London
papers, calculated in general to tickle the Ears, and drain the pockets
of that duped, and almost mimd Nation. This Nation seems in general extremely averse to engaging in the
War, both Nobles & People, but the Prince Regent is said to be under
the absolute guidance and controul of one Man, Martin de Mello,
who is the Creature and Idolator of the English - 6000 Troops are
just embarked to join the Spanish Army, and the Portug?~have some
time since furnished their Quota of Ships to the English, but it seems
the French still consider this nation as not involved in the War
against them, as .a Portugueze Ship is lately arrived from Bayonne in
France laden with pitch, tar, and paper - All the portugueze
vessels lately arrived, as well as many tl;mericans, complain bitterly
of the insults and pillage of the british privateers which they meet at
Sea, and of the pobteness of thefrench - but it is probably more wise
and prudent for both, to pocket the abuses a t present, than to resent
them. * * *

SIR Yesterday ye l l t p I rec* the following note from Coll Humphreys, our Minister Resident at this Court, but now at Gibraltar.
"DEARSIR" "We have advice of a Truce between the Portuguese
"and Algerines, and that an Algerine Fleet has gone into the Atlantic,
"Pray forward the inclosed with the intelhgence and believe me"
Your's
(Signed) D. HUMPHREYS
Immediately on receipt of this very alarming news, I called together
all the American Captains now in this Port, and communicated the
Contents of the above Letter, with such farther information as I had
a few minutes after obtained from a friendly and always well informed
Portuguese Gentleman - which was, that on the 5t@ instant an
Algerine Fleet consisting of eight armed Ships had been seen by a
Portuguese Frigate (just arrived) sailing out of the Mediterranem,
there were 4 Ships carrying 44,36,30, & 28 Guns - 3 Xebecs 20,24 &
26 Guns and one Brig of 22 Guns,
Their Signals to the Portuguese & English are said to be an English
Jack at the fore-top-gallant-Mast-head, and a Flag with blue and
white, or blue & Yellow stripes, at the Main top gallant mast head. Early this Morning I waited on his Excellency Luiz Pinto de Sousa
Minister & Secretary of State for foreign Affairs, on the subject of
in which i t had
this unexpected Event, and the unfortunate sit~at~ion
placed not only the American Ca tmnow here, but our Nation at large,
whose injury seems to have teen particularly meditated in this
nepociation: The Minister received me with great politeness, and anticipating
the cause of my visit, informed me that he was a t the moment of my
arrival occupied in writing to me on the subject, but was better
pleased to see me, as he could more fully and particularly explam the
nature of this business to me viva voce, than b letter, and assured
me that he would candidly communicate to me ow far the Court of
Portugal were concerned, or chargeable for the Mischiefs resulting from

g

48

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1786 TO 1801

this Truce, to all other Powers not at peace with Blgeirs, he declared
that it was as unexpected to the Court of Portugual as it could be to

us, and if it was not quite so unwelcome, yet it was by no means
agreeable to their Court, who never intended to conclude either a
Peace or Truce with the Dey without giving timely notice to all their
friends that they might avoid the dangers, to which they might otherwise be exposed by trusting to the Protection of the Portuguese Ships
of War stationed in the Mediterranean, - He acknowledged that
the Court of Portugal had about 6 Months past, expressed to the
Courts of England and Spain, a desire of their friendly cooperation to
induce a disposition in the Dey towards the establishment of a firm
and lasting peace with her most faithful Majesty, but having appointed
no Person directly or indirectly to negotiate in behau of her Majesty
they considered the business as only in embryo; but the british Court
zealous over much for the happiness of the two nations Portugal and
Algeirs, in order to precipitate this important business, very officiously
authorized Charles Logie the british Consul-General and Agent a t
Algiers, not only to treat, but to conclude, for and in behalf of this
Court,notonlywithout any Authority, butwithoutevenconsultingit ;A Truce was accordingly concluded between the Dey, and the british
Agent (for twelve Months) in behalf of her most faithful Majesty, for
the performance of which on the part of her Majesty the
British Court is Guarantee - the Condition is, that this Court shall
pay to the Dey one third as much as he receives, annually from the
court of Spain, - When this Court received information of this
proposed Condition from hl':Walpole the british Envoy to this Court;
They informed him, that however desirous they might be of a Peace
with Algiers, they were so far from being disposed to submit to such a
condition, that it was the determination of her most faithful Majesty
not to pay one farthing, but in the interval the Truce was signed by the
self constituted Agent Mr Logie, - The Minister Mr Pinto farther
informed me that this Court had ordered an Augmentation of their
Number of Armed Ships on the Mediterranean Station, so little mas
their expectation of a Truce or Peace with Algiers, and intimated that
the Algerines would probably ere long be less at liberty to cruise than
at present, and mentioned less than a Month but though I have great
confidence in his sincerity, and in the good wishes and disposition
towards us of many of the Portuguese Nobility, and of their sincere
hatred of the Enghsh, yet the Prince is young, weak, and obstinate,
and can, and probably mill determine as his own Caprice or Martin
de Mello may direct, - The Conduct of the british in this business
leaves no room to doubt, or mistake their object, which was evidently
aimed at Us, and proves that their envy, jealousy, and hatred, will never
be appeased, and that they will leave nothing unattempted to effect
our ruin, - as a farther confirmation it is worthy of remark, that the
same british Agent obtained a Truce at the same time between the
States of Holland and the Dey, for Six Months, whereby We and the
Eanse towns are now left the only prey to those Barbarians, - This
last Truce has in all probability cost the English very dear] as the
Algerines had profited much by Captures from the Dutch, slnce the
commencement of the late hostilities between the two Nations, This will I fear give a fatal Stroke to the advantages which we
might otherwise have derived from our Neutrality. -

I am a t this place interrupted by intelligence from A staunch friend
to America, who has information from the fountain head -it has
greatly shocked me -I have reason to fear that there is an infernal
combination in Europe against Us, France excepted, - and that we
have no other hope or resource but in our own Strength. Monday 14" I have just received a letter from Gibraltar of the 8'?
with orders to charter a Vessel to carry the intelligence to you Copy
of which letter I send herewith - At this moment a Sweedish Vessel
axrives - on the 94'' in Lat: 38. 13, She was boarded by an Algerine
Frigate, a t a small distance She saw another, which had just Captured 4 Americans, 2 Brigs, 1 Ship & 1 Schooner, - and one Genoese
ship She was informed of the Truce, and that it was for 12 Months with
Holland & Portugal - I have forwarded letters by Express wherever
I thought it necessary to notify our Citizens of their Danger, - We
are betrayed and many, many of our Countrymen will fall into the
Snare, - I send you a list of those in this port, - I have chartered
a Ship this Moment for £800 Sterle to carry my Dispatches, She sails
tomorrow - they will be delivered to you by Mr Livingston to whom
refer you for farther particulars, which In my great hurry I may omit;
I have not slept since Receipt of the news of this h e h h plot, - pardon
me for such Expressions - Another Corsair is in the Atlantic, God preserve Us, - News is just arrived P Post, that the French
have retaken Toulon - have repulsed the Duke of Brunswick with
great Slaughter; and that the Prince de Cobourg is in great Danger
of a total defeat, being hemmed in by a very powerful Army, whch
he dares not attack, Cetera desunt, - I have chartered the Vessel to
go, and return with a Cargo of wheat, or Flour to this Port or Cadiz,
for $800 Stlf, her freight back will go far to pay the Expence of her
hire - - God grant her a safe and speedy passage - Small hopes
now of a peace with Algiers - I t is currently reported here, that 3
or 4 some say 2 & some but 1 of the Algerine Frigates now cruising
against Us, were a late present from the british King, but for this I
have no other Authority than common report; if it should be thought
I have chartered the Vessel at a high price, I wish the Governmr to
be informed that all the protected Ships demand at least double since
the confirmation of this Algerine News, and I have been rather
favoured in the Contract which I have made, and therefore, hope no
blame will fall on me, but that I shall be enabled by the Government
to fulfill my Engagement, Upon farther e n q u q I am sorry to inform you that the letter cont a h g the above french News, comes from doubtful Authority. - I t
is a matter of certainty, which I have received from undoubted
Authority, though contradicted by the Minister Luiz Pinto, and at
present a great Secret, that one of the present Portg:" Ministers is in
this execrable plot, a plot loudly and publickly execrated by this
Nation - I asked if i t wns Martinio de Mello? and was answered
that all his consequence & his pecuniary Resources were derived from
the Meditefl fleet, or Algerine War, and of course no suspicion could
justly fall upon him - Was it the Secretary Luiz Pinto? my Informant only knew at present that one of the four Ministers had been
p r i z to the whole transaction, but could not fix it, but could and
wo d tell me very soon, at present he seemed disposed rather to suspect the first Minister, the Marquis Ponte-de-Lima, because he was

the inveterate Enemy of Martinho de Mello, whom my Author heard
say on a former occasion to An Ambassador on his taking leave of the
Court to go to Algiers to Negociate a peace, Sir! the Ships attend you,
you will therefore proceed without delay on your Embassy, but
remember what I have said, and what I now repeat, as of the greatest
consequence (meaning to himself) if you succeed in making a peace
you will do well, but if you should not succeed you will do much
better - the relation of these circumstances tho' trivial in themselves, may possibly enable ou to form a more adequate idea of this
Court than I should be ab e otherwise to give you, i t is with this
view I trouble ou with them, One of the rigates now Cruising under Algerine Colours was a
present from the King of Spain but not very lately - and one is
certainly a very late present from the british King - I write in
great haste, and perturbation of mind, yet hope and believe I have
omitted nothing in my power to communicate for the public good &
Safety, to promote which, I pray you to believe me ever most firmly
and sincerely devoted - If by the harshness of some of my expressions I should appear to ou to be more strongly prejudiced against
the british, or british po iticlrs, than my Countrymen in general, I
trust it is only because I know them better; Few of my Countrymen
having been so much conversant with them for 30 years last past,
the Interval of the late War excepted, and Fewer perhaps have observed & Studied them so much, I am convinced they were making
large Strides again in America, and would probably ere long have
possessed an influence there which sooner or later would have proved
our ruin, but Heaven I hope has timely interposed, and doomed them
to fall into the pit which they were digging for Us, and that great good
will ultimately be derived to Us from this great Evil, it is greatly to
be deplored that so many of our Citizens must be doomed to perpetual
Slavery, but better so, than the whole Nation, of which there seemed
to be not a little danger. I keep this letter open to make such additions as occasions may
offer, 'till the moment the Vessel weighs Anchor, She has nothing to
do but to take in Water I send you by this opp? a large Packet of letters from Col! Humphrey~which doubtless contain the most important intelligence -

SIR I have the honour to transmit you by the Brig Fair Hebe

for Philad" a Copy of my Letter to you of yesterday
[referring toMr. Humphreys' circular of 8 October 17931 by the Two
Sisters' Cap' Sheffield. - both vessels go out together, which affords'
a better chance of the Dispatches reaching you which I have received
from Mr Humphreys', & of which a duplicate goes heremth. While I am writing there are two American vessels' beating in,
which I have advised of their danger; - they are within the reach of
our Guns. We labour under great difEculty on account of a ractice which
calls' loudly for redress. whatever English ships' of orce come into
this Bay strip all American Vessels of their Men, the Natives of that
Kingdom they take out of them by main force, tho' these always'
enter as American Citizens', & Swear themselves to be Such, & the
Americans they use every endeavour to entice away. - There is
now here an English Frigate, the Adomache CapWones, which has
hardly left two Men on board of any American Vessel, & we have the
mortification to see Cap' Sheffield threatend with being deprived of
3 of his, which if executed, he will not be able to get away. - 1.m
endeavouring to prevent it, but as there is no Person here.authonsed
to represent the American cause, there is no redress of grievances to
be obtain'd.
My exertions on these occasions' proceed not from Officiousness,
but from a sincere attachment to a Country in which I have reaided
upwards of 3 year's, & of which I became a Citizen, & shall ever consider myself as such tho' Establish'd here in Trade. - My House is
extensively connected in Business with the United States, & the
grievances which I complain of bear hard on it. The Dispatches with which you entrusted me in November 1791
for Mc Carmichael at Madrid were duly forwarded & received by
him. [SDA. CL, Cadiz, Vol. 1-1791-1805.1

SIR 011 Saturday the 19" Instant, the Vessels belonging to the
Hanseatic Towns were ordered to be in readiness to sail the 25" under
Convoy of Two Portugueze Frigates, ordered by her Majesty to
Convoy them to a certain Latitude. - One of the Articles of the
Truce with Algiers which was communicated to me on the 12t!'
Instt by Luiz Pinto the Minister for foreign Affairs, expressly restricted the Portugueze from affording protection (without exception)
to any one Nation, Nevertheless the Consul and Agent for the Hanseatic Towns, petitioned for a Convoy, apd strongly .Urged a right
founded on a prior Treaty of a very ancient date exlsting between
the two Nations, this was generally understood to be the principle
upon which the Convoy was granted, and was so publickly declared
by the Agent, - but I had strong reasons to believe that this Government were by no means pleased with the conditions of the truce, or
the manner in which it had been negociated FOR and not BY this
Nat'ion, and that tho' they did not think proper formally to disavow
and reject it., yet that they wou'd not be displeased if a plausible
retence shou'd offer to break it, - I was also convinced that a great
LajoritY,if not the whole Nation, were extremely offended for various
reasons, they conceived it intended not only to throw on them the
odium of the manifest treachery in the business, but that it was also
aimed at their Navy, which was now an object of their particnlar
attention, and which for want of some employment, wou'd again sink
into neglect, which they suppose to have been one object of the
English in so eagerly precipitatin this Truce. - Upon the presumption that such was the genera opinion, and my knowledge that
the Spanish Ambassador when at Court on the 15t? Instt had been
treated rather roughly by all the Nobility present when he congratulated the Prince on the happy event of the Truce; - I wrote
a letter to the Minister Yesterday, of which transmit you a Copy pr
this opportunity, and as I have been diligent, i n my Enquiries prior
to my writing, and am particularly favoured m t h the mterest and
support of two very distinguished Personages here, who have honored
me with some particular attentions, I am greatly flattered with
hopes of Success; if I find there is a prospect of a speedy and favorable
Answer, it is probable I may detain the Vessel a day or two in order
to Convey such intelligence which will be so very important and
acceptable to the United States. * * *

P. S. I cannot give a stronger proof of the Sincerity of the disgust
and disappointmt of this Court on account of the Truce w* Algiers,
than that the Spanish & British Ministers were unsuccessfully opposed
to the granting Us a Convoy, this comes from the best Authority,
even Martin ho de Mello favoured Us in this instance - in short the
British have lost ground by this left-handed policy, and the general
opinion that I do not love them over-much is now no small recommendation of me; I think this would not be an unfavblemoment to
propose a commercial Treaty upon a broad & liberal Basis
the
advantage could not fail in every view to preponderate in our favor I wish this may be taken into immediate and serious consideration as
our Commerce wtF this C o u t r y holds out very many advantages to

may benefit their navigation or commerce as far as may be compatible

that the vessels of the said states shall enjoy m their passage the same
protection which she has ordered to be extended to the vessels of the
Hanseatic towns until the conclusion of the ratification of the truce
adjusted between her M. F. Majesty $ the regency of Algiers: provided nevertheless that the vessels of the US. which shall desire to
shelter themselves under the protection of the said convoys, shall
unite & assemble in sufficient nuplber to merit to be convoyed; as
this measure cannot be practised m favor of a few, for clear reasons
which manifest themselves.

well, these articles having risen considerably in Consequence of what

to take Shelter from the Algerines The sum of four Hundred thousand Hard Dollar's has been just

purpose of speculating on the American Property which may be taken
by the Algerines, The Merchant's of Gibraltar are disposed to do
the same, & I am sorry to observe many among them there & here,
who owe much to America, This I fear will encourage these in their

but it would seem as if the Ho e had arrived after it was written. ALI the Cruisers were a t dgiers save one Ship and ready to sail

been at anchor 12'Vnst off Larach with an American Brig loaded at

being Captured the llth[see 3 November] of Oct. by an Algirine
Frigate of 26 Guns 50 Leagues S W. of Cape SVincent and brought
to this place where I arrived the 30* of Oct. when we were all put on
shore, where I found the unfortunate Crews of 10 more Americans all
captured in October, On our landmg we were all put into Chains
without the least distinction and put to hard labor from daylight
untill night with only the allowance of two small black loaves and
Water & close confined a t night we suffered much on board the Cnriser,
for when they boarded us they even took the clothes from our backs
& brought us on board almost naked in this s~tuationthey put us
into the Cable Tier without any thing, not even a blanket to Cover
us where we remained untill our m v a l here without even a shirt
to shift us. Death would be a great relief & more welcome than a
continuance of our present situation, without a peace you may be
assured that the whole coast of Europe will be blockaded by their
Cruisers, as they have been as far as Cape Ortegal, and it is not a
doubt but they will go as far next Sp
as the Channel of England,
as they are building more Cruisers, T ey have now four Frigates
from 26 to 46 Guns. Two Brigs of 24. four Zebecks of 20 p & four
smaller ones which have all been at sea since their Truce w?th Porm more
tugal. The Cruisers that are now at sea we expect will b
Prizes tho' God forbid for the situation of the Convicts at t e Castle
would be happiness to our situation, for we think ourselves happy if
we escape through the day being beat by our drivers, who c m e s a

SIR, Since my letter N G , of which the foregoing is a Copy, I have
been deprived of a Conveyance from hence to America to have the
honor of addressing you. Captain Gooch of the Deboniar was chased
by an Algireen which obliged him to put into Gibraltar and continued
there till the 28'" of November when he Sailed with four other American Ships bound home under convoy of a portugueeze Frigate of war
destined for Lisbon: I had the pleasure of seeing Colonel Humphreys at Malaga very
soon after he sent me the express from Gibraltar mentioned in my
former letter, from hence he proceeded on by land to Alicante where
he has been waiting for an answer from Algiers to know if he would be
allowd to go and treat with the Dey of that Regency. I have no
advice from the Colonel on the Bussyness, but advices have come
here lately from Alicante that he has received a most arrogant Denial
forbidding his going to Algiers, I wish the report may not be true. By advlces from Algiers of the 4'p November I am informed that y9
Algereen fleet that Saded the 6" of October through the streights into
the Atlantic were all returned to that Port and had brought m t h them
thirteen American and three Genoeese prizes, but no list of the Names
thereof have yet appeared excepting one Capital Ship called the Hope,
John Burnham that was coming to Malaga from Rotterdam in ballast
and was met by the Enemy at the entrance of the streights, this Ship
is of four hundred Tons measurment her crew consisted of eighteen
men and two British Passengers one of which has a house of bussyness
Established at this place to whom he gives a very deplorable account
of the treatment given to the American and other prisoners taken by
them Barbarians. I t is well known that her Faithfull Majesty is much displeased with
the Algereens having so suddenly committed a breach of the truce
agreed for her with the Regency, for i t would appear that the latter
was bound not to send a Cruizer into the Atlantic until1 the expiraand the Comtion of four months after exchangeing the prelemina
mander of her naval force that was Stationed in t e Strelghts was
blamed for letting their fleet pass on the 6'p october. -

Algerines first Cruize, notwithstanding the reports to the contrary. I am Sorry to tell you, he advises Capture of the Brig Minema of

600,000. ---to the Dey & Family 600,000. --- to the Officers of the Regency Ambassadorial & Consular presents, which he Estimates at 600,000.

[SDA. CL, Gibraltar, Vol. 1, April 1791-Dec. 1795.1
Concerning Naval Force adequate to protection of commerce of the United States
against Algiers

Communicated to t h House of Representatives, 20 Januanj, 1794
Mr. Fitzsimons, from the committee appointed to report the naval
force adequate to the protection of the commerce of the United States
against the Algerine corsairs, together with an estimate of the expense,
and the ways and means for defraying the same, made the following
report:
THAT,
by the best information the committee could obtain, it
a pears that the naval force of the Algerines consists of light vessels,
of' different size and force, (exclusive of galleys) carrying in the whole
two hundred and eighty-two guns; and that it has not varied considerably for many years past; that the vessels (except two*or three)
are slenderly built, smaller in size than vessels of war belongmg to the
Christian Powers, c a m the same number of guns, and principally
manned with people bttle accustomed to the management of large
ships.
From a consideration of these circumstances, the committee are of
opinion that four ships, capable of carrying forty-four guns, each, and
two ships, carrying twenty-four guns, each, will be sufficient to protect
the commerce of the United States against the Algerine corsairs.
That the cost of the naval armament aforesaid, including six months'
stores and provisions, and three months' pay to the officers and
seamen, will amount to- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - $600,000
That the annual expense of the said armament, as the same may
probably be kept in service, will amount to - - - - - - - - - - - - - 247,960

.

WARS WITH BARBARY POU'ERS

61

The particulars of which estimate are detailed in the papers submitted with this report.
The ways and means proposed by the committee for defraying the
cost and annual expense of all the said armament are,
An additional duty of one per cent. on all goods which now pay a
duty of seven and a half per cent.
An additional duty of five per cent. on all stone and earthen ware,
and marble and slate, bricks, k c . imported. An additional duty of
three cents per bushel on salt; of twenty-five cents per ton on alf ships
or vessels, other t n ships or vessels of the United States; and of six
cents per ton on a ships or vessels of the United States, employed in
foreign trade; which said several duties they estimate to produce three
hundred and three thousand seven hundred and thirty-two dollars,
agreeably to the estimate No. 1, herewith.
In pursuance of all which, the committee submit the following
resolutions:
Resol~ed,That a naval force, to consist of four ships of forty-four,
and two ships of twenty guns, each, be provided, for the protection of
the commerce of the United States against the Algerine corsairs.
Resolved, That, for the purpose of defraying tohecost of a naval
armament, and the annual expense thereof, after the - - - - - - day of
------,------,
there be levied, collected, and paid, upon all goods,
wares, and merchandise, imported into the United States, and on
which a duty of seven and a half per cent. is now payable, an additional duty of one per cent.
Upon all marble, slate, and other stone; on bricks, tiles, tables,
mortars, and other utensils of marble or stone; and, generally, upon
all stone and earthen ware, an additional duty of five per cent. Upon
salt, three cents per bushel, estimating the bushel at fifty-slx pounds.
On ships or vessels of the United States, employed in foreign trade,
six cents per ton; on all other ships and vessels, twenty-five cents
per ton.
That the like drawbacks and allowances be mado of the said additional duties as are now made of the duties upon go,~dsexported from
the United States, and upon fish and salted provisions.
That a separate account of the said duties be kept.
That the President of the United States be authorized to receive,
on loan, a sum not exceeding - - - - - - dollars, to be applied towards
the building and equipment of the said naval armament, a t an interest
not exceeding - - - - - - per cent. per annum; and that the said l o a ~be
open to any individual, body politic or corporate, within the United
States. That the revenues herein before recited he pledged for the
payment of the interest on the loan aforesaid, and the annual expense
of the said armament; and that the surplus of such revenue be applied
to the repayment of the principal, and to no other purpose whatever.
That a committee be appointed to bring in a bill or bills in conformity with the foregoing resolutions.

tually transmit to you the state of things a t the moment, whensoever,

I shall receive notice from this port, New-York, or Baltimore, in consequence of the arrangements, which I am taking, that any vessel is

sailing for your residence.
I did not expect to have troubled you with another letter, before
an answer was prepared to that of compliment from her Majesty.
But being just informed that the vessel expedited with the Algerine
intelligence, is returning directly from New-York to Lisbon, and that
the mail of to morrow is the last, which will reach her, I cannot neglect
the opportunity of enabling you to anticipate by your informal and
occasional interviews with the Ministry those sentiments of regard,
which her Majesty's late conduct has inspired, and which the President
will soon embrace an occasion of interweaving in the reply to her letter.
By advices from several respectable quarters, we dady learn, that
some one or other of the powers of the Mediterranean, who have
hitherto contributed to keep the pirates of Algiers in check, are withdrawn, by negotiation, terror, or actual invasion from hostility against
them. If our correspondents had been even silent as to the original
author of this defection, our general suspicions would have directed us
to the B d i s h government. But all doubts would vanish ij it be true as
it it represented, t h d a british Consul, without authority from the @een
of Portugal, has presumed to conclude a truce with the Algennes,
imposing a heavy tribute upon her, and annihilating the principal
cause of vigor to her marine.
It cannot, therefore, be too strongly impressed upon the Court of
Lisbon, how highly the President of the United States esteems the
ma animity with which that t m e , has been resisted by her Majesty,
wit what satisfaction he discerns in her o position an attention-to
the welfare of the United States - how apt y it reciprocates our m h
to bind the two natiolls more closely together; how grateful the
Citizens of the United States have shewn themselves to this instance
of her favor; and how much i t must be an object with the American
shipping to resort to her ports, where they will find such ample
protection. The arrogance of the British Consul, in forming the truce,
if he acted without orders from home, and the indignity to the Portuguese
nution, if no previous assent was given to the measure, - strike us here
very forcibly. But you, who are on the spot can alone determine,
whether t h sensibility qf the Court be enough alive, and circumstances
permzt. thud remarks of this kind may be used. I t is the earnest desire
of the President, that nothing be omitted, which is conciliato~y,and
that every thing which may irritate, be avoided.
We entertain a hope, founded upon your zeal and knowledge, that
Algiers before the receipt of this letter, will have been soothed into
terms, proper for our acceptance. But as this is uncertain, and a
peace with those, who are educated in Sea-robberies, is very unstable,
altho' sanctioned by every profession and solemnity; we ought to
obtain a statement of some facts, which we do not seem yet to possess
with accuracy. I am anxious therefore to be precisely informed.
1. What are the nations, bordemg on the Mediterranean, who are
generally exposed to the ravages of the Algerines 2. What naval force those nations have been accustomed to employ,
or can, in case of exert.ion, employ against the Algennes.
3. Is it probable, that they would associate with us, to restrain the
Algerines; and upon what terms?

f?

f'

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS

4. Upon what terms, is i t probable, that they would furnish a
stated armament, equal to the object, without any Ships being supplied b the United States.
5.
ch of the Mediterranean Powers, who are commonly a t war
with Algiers, have been debauched from it, by the interposition of
Great Britain, or any other Go~ernment.
Portugal, however, is the best bulwark which any alliance on
our part can find against those Rovers. Let me entreat you therefore,
to enter freely into discourse with her Minister, and fix with precision,
his ideas of the mode, which promises most success. We cannot
doubt his candor; but the ascendancy of Great Britain, is too often manifested in her Councils. Hence you will impose no restraint on yourself,
in your conversation with him, except sofur, as there may be a danger of
injurious communications being made to the Court of London.
The President has instructed me to urge you to seize the present
moment for discovering what may be expected from an attempt to
accomplish a treaty of commerce. With the omen of a good disposihon
in Portugal; with the intrinsic importance of our trade with her,
increased by the multiplication of our Citizens, and secured by a
neutrality, which a convulsion in Europe, although nearly mversal,
cannot compel us to abandon; - Portugal must discover inducements
to a connection with us now, which perhaps may not be so strongly
felt, when the other nations are less engaged in war, and thelr bpleasure may fall more sorely. * * *

To Secretary of State from Nathaniel Cutting, Lisbon, Portugal
(Duplicate.)

SIR,Knowing that Colonel Humphreys has beed very assiduous in
improving every opportunity to acquaint the Executive of the Umted
States with the steps he has taken in pursuance of his mission to the
Dey & Regency of Algiers, I have hitherto thought i t unnecessary
for me to give you the trouble or perusing anything on that Subject: - but as I had the honor of bemg employ'd by tbe Department
of State, in a subordinate capacity [Secretary of David Humphreys],
on the same mission, I hope ou will not think me impertinent @
communicating to you some o servations reJative to the busmess m
question which have occurred to me in its progfess. The only
Letter I have written relative to my proceedings m ~t was from this
City soon after my arrival here last year, - giving a simple narrative
of my progress towards Algiers, and of the circumstances which had
unexpectedly impeded it. - I beg leave to refer you to that Letter,
and to resume the subject a t the period when it is datad. The intelligence that I received soon after my arrival a t Lisbon,
and a comparative view of all the information I previously possessessed,
confirmed me in the opinion I had long entertained that the mission
to Algiers would prove fruitless. As a proof that my mind was then
imprest with that idea, I take the liberty to observe that m 8 Letter
which I wrote to John Vaughan Esq' - Philadelphia, under date
Lisbon 9*) Septl ultQ,without giving any indication of my real pursuit,

g

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1786 TO 1801

I exprest my apprehension that Coercion would be an indispensible
preliminary to a Treaty of Peace with Algiers on reasonable terms.
The Event but too fully justifies my opinion. I presume that Colonel
Humphreys has given you in detail, as far as was necessary, an account
of the slow & tedious jobb wh[ic]h I undertook a t Gibraltar; I mean
that of adjusting the affairs which the late Thomas Barclay Esq: had
at that place, (in his capacity of a Public agent.) - As he left no
books of accounts nor any regular Invoices, to direct us, I had to
proceed on such detached documents as happened to be deposited
with M' James Simpson of that City, with whose friendly and unremitted assistance, I was enabled to make the arrangement which
Colonel Humphreys has, I suppose, transmitted to your office, and
which I hope is honored with your approbation. We had to examine
and repack every article of merchandlse left there by Mt Barclay, in
order to select such as might be useful in the negotiation we had in
hand, - and likewise that we might ascertain precisely, & obtain
a specific receipt for, the merchandise that might still remain deposited
a t Gibraltar. Before this business was accomplished, we had the mortification to
hear of the Truce between Algiers & Portugud, and to see the Pyratical
Flag display'd in the Bay of Gibraltar by one of those Ships of War
which the insidious policy of certain European Powers has let loose
to ravage the Commerce of America in the Atlantic. Though from
that moment i t might naturally be concluded that our mission would
prove abortive, yet Colonel Humphreys, whose attachment to, and
zeal in support of, the True Interests of his Country is not to be
shaken by any common obstacles, - thought it indispensibly necessary for us to proceed on our expedition as far as we could with any
degree of safety to ourselves, or prospect of advantage to the United
States.
A previous step to be taken was to dispatch Expresses both by
Sea & Land to convey intelligence to Cadiz, Lisbon & Malaga respecting this unforseen occurrence, which threatened such terrible depredations on the Commerce of the United States.
Mr James S i son of Gibraltar, seconded all our opperations with
that indefatigab e zeal and activity which indicates sincere amity
and an invincible attachment to the cause of humanity. * * * * * *
We had reason to apprehend that certain British Agents, either
authorized by Government, or self-constituted in the hope of promoting their own interest by injuring that of the United States, had vgilantly regarded our proceedmgs and had transmitted such
intelligence to the Algerines as might render it particularly dangerous
for us to proceed up the Mediterranean by Sea, though under the
protection of a Flag now respected by the Dey & Regency of Algiers; - and the property of the United States aboard the Vessel,
it was thought, would pass more securely to Alicante without us, in
case of being examined by any of the Pyrates, than if Colonel Humphreys and myself were on board. For if any of the Renagadoes discovered that we were Americans i t would immediately excite their
suspicions respecting the property on board; and discovering so large
sn amount in Specie, they would probably have been induced to
disregard the neutrality of the Flag we were under, and either take
us and the property out, or carry the Vessel and all into Algiers. I t
was therefore thought expedient for us to proceed to Alicanta by

P

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS

Land; - t h being the Port where we could have the most ready
communication with Algiers. After a tedious & fatiguing Journey of
above four hundred miles, over the worst roads, perhaps, in the
Universe, we arrived a t Alicante on the 2e November. - We found
in Mr Montgomery the American Consul there, a shady, zealous
and active friend, firmly attached to the interest of the United States,
and disposed to co-opperate in our pursuits even to the neglect of his
private affairs. - Doubtless Colonel Humphreys has transmitted
you in detail the account of his dispatching run Express Boat to
Algiers - Of the haughty and insolent reply of the Dey to the person
who acquainted him with our mission, - and finally, of his utter
refusal to receive Colonel Humphreys as Commissioner Plenipotentiary
from the United States, or to treat with him on any terms whatever.
The property which we had in charge belonging to the Unitad States,
yet remained on board the Swedish Vessel which convey'd i t to
Alicante; - and as the object of our mission appeared now to be
unattainable, it became necessary to deposite this property in other
hands. The pressing necessities of those unfortunate Americans who
had been recently carried into Algiers, a9 well as those who had been
years in Captivity there, demanded an appropriation of a considerable
proportion of the Specie. Colonel Humphreys, whose humanit was deeply interested on this
occasion, naturally judged that not on!ry the Executive of the United
States, but the Citizens at large, would applaud the exercise of his
discretionary power in applying such a sum to the immediate relief
of the suffering prisoners as might prevent their sinking under the
hardships which they must inevitably encounter. - He therefore
determined to take immediate order for that benevolent purpose. On
mature deliberation it was thought proper thus to appropriate Sixteen
thousand dollars, - as being a supply sufficient for one year, in the
course of which the Government of the United States might make such
further arrangements as should be found expedient. Intelligence
from Madrid, & the critical situation of the political Connection between Europe and the United States of America, excited some suspicion that a rupture might soon take place between the latter &
Spain: - I therefore took the liberty of advising Colonel Hurnphreys
not to leave the remaining twenty-four thousand dollars in specie,
within the power of the Spanish Government; but to authorize Mr
Montgomery to invest i t immediately in good B a s on London,
which were then under par at Alicante; -by which means it might be
transferr'd to Lisbon so as to gain about ten p: Cent whenever i t should
be necessary to re-invest the amount in mexican dollars. - My advice
was seconded by the opinion of Ms Montgomery, - but Colonel
Humphreys, no doubt for very good reasons, did not think proper to
follow it; - and postponed any final decision on the subject till he
should have consulted M' Carmichael and Mr Short at Madrid.
Therefore by direction of Colonel Humphreys I had both the specie
and rnerchandize landed; the former deposited with Mr Montgomery;
the latter in the Custom House. What ulterior arrangements Colonel
Hmphreys has made in the business, I do not know, - as he has not
honored me with any communication on that subject since we left
Alicante. - We returned via Madrid, and arrived safe at this City
on the night of the 24'? ultv -

66

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1786 TO 1801

Pennit me now to make a few observations which occur on the subject of the foregoing narrative. From the best intelligence I have obtained, and from comparing circumstances, I am fully of opinion that the English Government has
been the principal and primary cause that our mission to Algiers has
proved abortive. The Portugueze Cabinet of itself has had but little
hand in bringing about the melancholly catastrophe which has added
so greatly to the number of our suffering Citizens - to the actual loss
of property as well as to the general injury of our Trade.
The Success which the Corsairs of Algiers have already had, has
confirmed the Dey in his exorbitant conhtions for a Peace, & rendem
it more necessary than ever that the principal preliminary on our part
be a respectable naval armament. If Colonel Humphreys had been so
fortunate as to arrive in Algiers previous to the Portugueze Truce
being agreed on, he might possibly have retarded that Event, or have
contrived some means to prevent its immediate ill consequences to
the Commerce of the U. S. A. ;- but I M y believe that neither the
Logic or Eloquence of an Angel would have prevailed on the Dey &
Regency to have agreed to a peace with the U. S. A. on any of the
Terms prescribed by our Legmlature. The pecuniary consideration
was not sufficient, - no, not by some hundreds of thousands of dollars! - I wish, however, very sincerely, that the experiment could
have been tried. * * * * * *
In my opinion it would be more to the honor and advantage of any
nation which is determined to keep up a naval establishment, to expend ten times the sum in supporting a Squadron of Ships of War in
the Mediterranean sufficient to protect its Commerce, than tamely to
comply with the insolent demands which the chief of a gang of Robbers
is leased to make. !he grand principle that has hirtherto opperated upon all the maritime Powers of Europe in this business, appem to me to be not so
much the offspring of fear and avarice, as of jealousy & envy. - A
miserable spirit of illiberality has induced them to practice all the
infamous arts offinesse rather than openly and steadily to pursue a gallant warfare against those petty villains who wantonly infringe the
rights, and impede the social intercourse between different members,
of "the great family of mankind". - Each one seems to entertain the
contemptible apprehension that some other, or perhaps all the other,
Commercial Nations might profit of its exertions, and enjoy the advantages of a peaceful Commerce without being at any trouble or
expense in protecting it; - therefore each aims seperately to bribe the
common aggressor, whom they might easily Crush, - in the expectation of gainmg some exclusive advantage by it: or rather, actuated by
the despicable motive abovemention'd, no one of them is w d h g disinterestedly to promote the general welfare of mankind; - but occasionally plays off this scourge of Commerce upon each other, according
as particular passions or interests may happen to predominate. How small a proportion of the immense amount that has been received by the States of Barbary as the price of peace with this last
half Century, would support a naval armament sufficient to annihilate
their Marine! This, I am aware, would not be so eas an achievement
as many imagine; - but still I think it within the k e of possibility
if proper methods are ursued. It is not great f o ~ c ethat is so necessary
to effect this desireab e purpose, as great vigihnce, activity, p h m t ~ .&

persevereance.
Portugal, by keeping a small Squadron on this
service for some years past, has demonstrated that the depredations
of the Pyratical Corsairs of Algiers & Tunis may easily be confined to
the Mediterranean. The Portugueze Naval Commanders though
brave, & their mariners though probably capable and obedient, yet
are supposed to have been rather remiss in pursuit of the object for
and
which they were, ostensibly, stationed in the Mediterranean;
are known to be very timid with respect to cruizing where time or
place presents any djfllculty. If the Portugueze so effected much,
what might be expected from a similar force, the opperations of
which would be directed by skill & intrepidity, stimulated by resentment of unprovoked injury, - by a
of obtaining exemplary
revenge, - and above aLl actuated by the noble desire of serving the
cause of humanity & promoting the interests of Universal Commerce! -

-

Another proof of the envious and .rindicti~redisposition of the
English Government towards us is the unjust capture & detention of
so many of our ships on false or frivolous pnetences. - And, finally,
to cramp our flourishing Commerce still further, and to do us irreparable injury, I am convinced that the same Government, by its
malevolent machinations, has paved the way for, and incited the
Algerines to, actual Hostdities against our nation; for the consequences of which, it is impossible in the nature of things that we can
ever obtain adequate compensation. The l a o m and immediate agent in this infernal conspiracy against
our peace and prosperity is at this instant walking in the Garden
beneath my window, with all the apparent composure & self-complaoency that can be inspired by successful villainy: Mr Logie, late
the British Consul a t Algiers, - who, unsolicited by the Court of
Portugal, negotiated the fatal Truce which has eventually wrested
from a considerable number of our industrious Citizens their Liberty,
from others their property - and from some, both: - and probably
has deprived their sympathizing Country & Connexions of the services
of many of them forever!
Mr Logie the other day in conversation
with Colonel Hurnphreys had the impudence to attempt excr~lpating
himself and the British Government from the blame cast upon them
by every disinterested person, - and, so far as I can learn, by the
Court of Port?lgul itself - for this nefarious and abominable transaction. He asserts that this Court earnestly prest lum to it; but
I do not believehim. * * *
After maturely weighing in my own mind actual circumstances and
their consequences, I feel confident that if my Fellow Citizens at
large in the U. S. have the WILL,they will find no deficiency in the
POWER, immediately to equip a naval Force that would be sficient
to defeat the malicous purposes of their enemies abroad, and be the
surest parrantee of peace and prosperity at home. -

As I have hinted above, some politicians, - as shallow, perhaps,

may think it premature to launch into the expence of a
naval expedition against the Algerines, till we have by Treaty secured
certain privileges in any or all of the European Ports. - I n my
humble opinion no other possible circumstance nor argument could
give so much efficacy to our negociations for those privileges, or any

other of a Commercial nature, as our having a respectable naval armament ready to put to sea. - This spirited & necessav exertion on
the part of the United States, though expensive in the h t instance,
would eventually prove good economy, - and must opperate every
way in their favor. It would, I am persuaded, preclude much useless discussion that now protracts the negociations of their Agents
with foreign Courts - it would almost instantaneously liberate our
valuable Commerce in the Mediterranean, and greatly facilitate our
intercourse with other markets where many productions of our Country would meet an advantageous sale;-and i t is evident that the
result would be a reduction of expence in some instances and an
increase of revenue in others. -

SIR An Act being under consideration of the Legislature of the
United States, for the equipment of some Ships of War, to check the
depredations of the Algerines upon the Commerce of America, and
understanding that it will rest in the option of the President, either to
build the proposed Armament here, or to procure them in any way,
that he may judge most elegible. - You have promised to excuse me,
while I take the liberty to communicate such information as fell under
my notice when I was last in France. - I was a t Bourdeaux iil June
last when I saw a number of fine large Copper-bottomed Frigate built
ships, from 26 to 30 Guns - some of which were quite new - these
Vessels had been built for the East India and Guinea trade, and which,
from the situation of that Country were become useless to the Ownersmany of whom would have been happy to have disposed of them, for
less than half their first cost - I had certain information that a t
Brest, there were several ships mounting forty Guns, under similar
circumsta~lceswith those a t Bourdeaux I cannot indeed say whether
the French Government will permit those Ships to be fitted under the
Flag of the United States - but I will venture an opinion, that if this
permission could be obtained, those ships might be put to sea a t an
expence far below what such Vessels would cost here, & several Months
earlier a t sea. I am just now about sailing upon a Voyage to Havana shall be
ready on my return to answer any questions you may think proper
to ask respecting this business. I will esteem it as a particular honour, if You will be pleased to
mention my name to the President of the United States, for the
Command of One of the Armed Vessels - my character is well known
in this City, Yet should it be necessary to present a recommendation
my Friends Gurney & Smith will procure i t and act for me during my
absence which I don't expect will exceed two Months. [SDA. CL, Algiers, Vol. 1, Part 1, April 1785-July 1795.1

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1785 TO 1801

It appears to be of indispensable necessity that immediate arrangements should be made to obtain the articles contained in the estimate
and to have them transported to the ports before mentioned - excepting such articles of the timber as may be obtained at, or in the neighbourhood of, the said places.
The live oak and red cedar must principally be obtained from the
islands on the coast of Georgia. Some parts however may be obtained
in North Carolina, although it is alledged that the farther South the
live oak the better
Different opinions are entertained as to the most certain, and the
most occonomical mode of obtaining the live oak and cedar from
Georgia, and transporting the same to the ports where the ships are
to be built.
Some persons recommend that one or more persons in whom due
confidence may be placed, should repair to the Islands of Georgia,
and contract with the proprietors of the timber as it stands for such
parts as will serve the moulds, and that a sufficient number of axe-nzen
with their provision, be sent from the northward, in order to cut the
same, and transport it to the places where it is to be used. These
persons assert that any contract made in Georgia or other parts to the
Southward, will be executed by negroes, whose indolence and carelessness will inevitably produce disappointment or loss.
The moulds for the timbers of both sized ships are preparing and
nearly finished. These must be transported to the places where the
timber is to be cut, otherwise mistakes would arise and disappointment of course ensue.
Besides the mode before mentioned, there are ersons who recommend a contract with some persons, if such coul be found, which is
said to be the case to procure the timber in Georgia, and transport it
to the respective ports or places.
You will please to judge which of these two modes will be preferable.
I have understood that in 1776 or 1777 the frames of two 74
were cut under the authority of the United States, part at unbury
ships
and part a t a place called Eilkenny near the mouth of Savannah River,
and that as the said timber was very large, part of it yet remains it may
therefore be proper to look it up, and if it should answer for the frames
of the proposed frigates as probable it would be excellent from its
long seasoning.
I have the honor to submit to you a letter from M' Wereat of Georgia
upon this subject, the purport of which is confirmed by Brigadier
General Gunn of the same state.
The manner in which these vessels ought to be built has been under
consideration, that is whether the hull and other parts susceptible of
the measure should be built by a contract, or by a capable agent or
agents appointed for the purpose of procuring the labor and materials.
Upon enquiry however it a pears improbable that a contract could
r s this place for the one directed to
be formed with the ~ h i ~ b u g d ein
be built here. They alledge that if a contract was offered and accepted by two or more it would excite the ill will and envy of those
who had no part in it, and as the frigate would require many hands
the price of that sort of labor would rise, and that therefore it would
be in the power of those not employed to raise the wages of the Journeymen a shilling or two per day, which would occasion great embarrassments, if not ruin, to the undertakers. Hence it would appear to

f

6

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS

73

follow as a consequence that if the Shipbuilders of Philsdelphia, some
of whom have considerable capitals, would decline a contract, that it
would be almoat or quite impracticable to obtain the building by contract elsewhere. If this should be so, then Agents respectable for
their int.elligence, activity, and integrity must be sought in the places
in which the said frigates are directed to be built.
The President of the United States has approved of the said vessels
being built under the directions of some agent or a ents which I presume it will be in your department to nominate to $,
I suppose however if you should find it practicable to build them by
contract, that the subject will still be reconsidered by him,and as for
myself I should find great satisfaction in a contract, if one, upon solid
principles, could be obtained.

inconveniences, when they arise in the course of their functions, I c m
compensate it only by a promise not to heap such business upon you
unnecessarily. But I trust, that you will take the proper measures,
respecting the public money in M' Montgomery's hands at Alicant,
and reimburse the Swedish Consul, according to the ideas, which you
have expressed on that occasion We were fearful from your letter of the 17" of Februarg 1794,
that the important, interesting, and never to be forgotten su ject of
our fellow citizens in Algiers would suffer from the want of some person
who might embrace any favorable moment. You then declared, that
you considered yourself as discharged from the Algerine mission. But
a subsequent indication of hope, and your reassumption of the &air,
until you should be relieved, have banished much of the anxiety which
- - entertained. In truth, Sir, it is impossible to dismiss you from
was
this service The enclosed letter from M' Gouvr Morris, connected with your
former instructions, this letter and your own operations mark the
sense of the Executive and the point at which the Algenne buslpess
has arrived. Col. Monroe, the Successor of Mr Morris as our mlnlster
in France, has been written to on this subject. He has been informed,
that the President learns with great satisfaction the new testimony,
given by the French Republic of attachment to the interests of the
United States; not doubting at the same time, that it must prove
beneficial to the supplies of France from hence: that the powers derived
from Mr Morris to the Agent who was to accompany on our part, the
French Commissioner, though as yet unknown to us, have no doubt
been judicious, and the acts in conformity with those powers will be
confirmed if they be found to come within the plan hitherto adopted:
that you were however appointed to this business in a special manner,
possess a full knowledge of our views and our means, and have been
particularly conversant in our attempts for peace with Algiers: that
you will therefore instruct, if you shall find it necessary, the Agent
appointed b Mr Morris; that we trust the auspices of the French
be continued to the efforts under your guidance; and
Republic
that as an evidence of our confidence in the French Government Col.
Monroe is empowered, if he thinks proper, to impart the terms, upon
which we offer to buy peace.

You will therefore consider yourself, as again charged with this
important interest of our country, according to the former instructions.
A power is lodged with Messp Willinks, Van Staphorsts and Hubbard
to borrow 800,000 dollars, and to hold the same to your draught.
Whensoever therefore the money can be used in our objects at Algiers,
you will draw for it. I t must be submitted to your discretion, upon
the view of all circumstances, as well of personal danger as public
benefit, whether you will go over yourself: a measure which unquestionably would enable you to seize more certainly, than when at a
distance, one of those moments of good humour and caprice, which
the letters transmitted through you from Algiers designate as the
lucky seasons for impressing the Dey, and consider, as having unfortunately for our country escaped without being caught. If however you
find it unsafe or impracticable to undertake the mission yourself, it
will then be proper to use the instrument, selected by Mr Morris and
to instruct him accordingly; maintaining always perfect cordiality
and concert with the French Commissioner, but a t the same time not
hesitating to follow your own ideas, when they shall seem preferable;
and resorting to the Swedish Consul at Algiers, his brother, or any
other individual or expedient according to your judgment on the best
mode of accomplishing success The President has under consideration the mode, in which the 800,000 dollars may be expended in the purchase of a peace; that is how
much shall be applied to the ransom and how much to the peace The newspapers will be sent by this conveyance. The letters whose
receipt I have to acknowledge since my last are the following. N Q
117. 118. April lo'!' 121. April 20. with sundry duplicates and triplicates I should not have closed this letter, before an addition, which I contemplate on the general state of our &airs was completed; were it not
for my solicitude for our friends in Algiers. I will however add at present, that finding a loss to the United States by the exchange of bills on
Amsterdam, I have determined to remit for the use of our ministers
at Lisbon and Madrid in an order from the Commissioners of his
Catholic Majesty here on the public treasury at Madrid. I have
accordingly sent to Ma Short a draught from them for 9,000 dollars;
u on which you wiU be pleased to draw; and I shall continue this mode
o remittance half yearly, unless you should disapprove it.
