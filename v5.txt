SHIP President
Malta 7 . Sep. 1804
SIR,I regret extremely that the circumstance of my having spoken
a Barbary cruiser on my passage from Gibraltar bars the pleasure
of offering you my personal respects previously to leaving this port;
at the same time I feel a pleasure in expressing a grateful sentiment
for the hospitality and tenders of friendly offices you have manifested I cannot, Sir, give you any interesting intelligence from America;
nor any thing European so late as you will have received through
more distinct channels - But a circumstance occurred on the
passage which cannot be altogether uninteresting to a naval Commander; as it may, perhaps, account for some of the innumerable
dangers marked on the charts of the Mediterranean On the 24. ult. at past 3. p.m. the W. point of Almaria bay bearing
N. about six leagues distant, and the small Island of Alboran S.
about eleven leagues - the ships President and Constellation sailing
in Company, with a light westerly wind and uncommonly smoth
sea, having about three knots way, were alarmed by a violent shock
like striking on an uneven, rocky bottom, which at every stroke seemed
to lift & let fall the ship about one foot - We were then at dinner
in the cabbin; and, supposing the ship aground, ran immediately
upon deck; but we discovered no appearance of a shoal, nor had
the ship lost her way - At the same instant the people of the
cutter, which was towing a stern, cried out in great consternation,
that The boat had struck something!
The weather had been so remarkably h e , Captain Campbell of
the Constellation had visited us, and was still on board - His ship,
being about a mile distance, made signal to speak us - On coming
along side - On coming along side, she reported that she had struck
upon rocks - I t appeared from enquiry, however, that she felt the
same shock, at the same instant, and in the same manner as above
described - I soon spoke a Spanish ship, then a league and an
half distant, whose master informed that he had felt the shock at the
same time At past 8. a.m. the next day, at least five leagues distant from
the place where this shock was felt, both ships, being distant from
each other 1% mile, experienced another similar shock, attended with
a rumbling noise resembling a vessel running over a shoal - The

+

continuation of the first shock was about 40 seconds - that of the
second a minute The effect which these singular occurrences seemed to have on the
feelings of the ship's people was also remarkable: the alarm, agitation,
and amazement appeared much greater than would have been created,
I believe, had the ship been actually aground.

MALTASeptr Yth 1804.
DEARSIR Having arrived in those seas with an additional force
to the Squadron here before me I cannot deny myself the pleasure
of addressing you ever grateful for the polite and hospitable attention I experienced a t your house while in Leghorn, 1 hope in the
course of the winter to pay you my personal respects. I have been mortified extremely by the contrary winds which has
lengthen'd our passage in an uncommon degree, it being now two
months since we left the United States, this has compel'd me to call
here for a supply of water, I shall this day proceed with the President
& Constellation for Tripoli but fear the season is too far advanced
to bring the Bashaw to terms before the arrival of the Congress and
Essex which I left a t Gibraltar until the views of the Emperor of
Morocco are ascertain'd in equiping for sea his whole marine force:
this circumstance threatens hostiIity somewhere, & if the commerce
of the United States should be his object great indeed would be the
havock if left unprotected, he has again demanded a free passage for
a vessel loaded with wheat for (as he says) the poor of Tripoli, this
has been refused in the most unequivocal terms, & it is thought that
this will be a pretext for war. I have no news being quarantined
here in consequence of having examined a Tunisian Corsair on my
passage up the mediterranean. - I assure you it will give me pleasure to hear from you, & if I can in any way serve you command me
freely; be so good as to present my respects to MrWathcart & your
charming children & believe me to be with much esteem. [NA. SDA. CL, Tunis, Vol. 2, Part 2, 1803-1806.1

Dr SIR, I am on board the Squadron in Character of Navy Agent
of the United States for the several Barbary Regencies. - but for
the special purpose of reviving & giving effect to the plan of operation
formed yourself & me in conjunction with Hamet Bashaw. - I
candidly confess I entertained an individual wish that we should
find affairs a t Tunis in such a situation as to afford me an opportunity
of gratifying a righteous resentment against that Regency. - But
that Bashaw is as wise as wicked; & times his measures by too certain
a calculation to commit himself; there is now no prospect that he
will provoke chastisement while the means of giving it himself are SG
convenient. - I regret that he could not be prevailed on to accredit

you a t his court, and more particularly since I have taken an agency
in an affair of enterprize which could be materially assisted by your
light .
Morris is dismissed the service. - Murray is supported by a
mighty phalanx of mighty friends; but they have wisdom enough to
keep him out of sight. He ought to have been cashiered for disobedience of orders. - During the storm which has broken around
me, I have suffered a wreck of fortune; but don't know that my
reputation bears any marks of the shafts which were aimed a t it. I
have certainly had the gratification to see all the measures adopted
which you & I had so long recommended concerning the intercourse
of the United States with the Barbaxy Regencies - And I am satisfied
with the expression of the national opinion of my conduct as their
representative at Tunis. - Thus far I have sketched my story. and hope it will induce you to reciprocate yours. With very sincere respects to Mrs Cathcart your lady, believe me
to remain,

On the first of Septr arrived here an English Frigate, the Narcistws,
CaptQonnelly, from Lord Nelson, with a letter to the Dey, which,
it is said, was written in a friendly Stile; saying that a New Consul wd
be sent out, as soon as peace shg take place between France & Engg;
but demanding the release of all the Maltiese, taken under British
protections. - This was, however, not complied with; but no altercation took place. The Ship recd a supply of Stock &? and sailed it is
said for London. - I did not see the Commander; being at m
Garden on his arrival, and not expecting him to Sail so soon as he di$
which was the third day after his arrival, when I had gone to town to
see him. - We have various reports of the Marabout, some say he is
powerfull; others that he has retired to the Mountains, with few
followers. - I t is Certain, however, that the land communication
between this &- Tunis, has been stop'd for almost two months, By my last letters from Tunis, the Bey was fitting out all his
Cruizers; but our Charge dlAffaires Expresses no apprehensions of a
rupture with us while we are so strong in this sea as we are at present. - I enclose the copy of a letter from CaptQBainbridge of the
loth of July, which will shew his situation at that time, as well as that
of his unfortunate Companions. I have not heared from our Squadron since I wrote you last. I
presume, ere this, they have commenced their Operations against
Tripoli; and I am in daily expectation of the arrival of a Frigate from
them to take me up.
I trust our differences with Spain will be amicably settled. A
rupture with the U States would be inevitably followed by the loss
of the Floridas, and their Mexican Territories; not more from the
situation and disposition of our Citizens, than from the opportunity
it would give her Subjects to become indipendant

any Other Vessel, 4 or 5,000, good Corks which are an article not to
he purchased here at present? The Bill of them shall be paid at

The Bashaw took me with him, and his suit to his country seat
where we spent the most of the day. About 5 o'clock P. M. we went
to see the great Marabewt, or Mahometan priest, in whom the Bashaw
had great faith, and thought he could foretel events. It was said by
the Turks, that he foretold the stranding and capture of the Philadelphia; and that he got offended with the Bashaw and caused and
foretold her being burnt. But I had heard nothing of these mysteries
until a little previous to this. He now said that the commodore's
ship, the Constitution, would never return to America; that she would
either be blown up, or run on shore; and that the Bashaw would have
success in his warfare with America.

THESQUADRON
OF COMMODORE

On the Capture of the Philadelphia, Congress passed Act of 25th
March 1804. - The President was authorized to employ such of the
armed vessels as he might deem requisite for protecting the Commerce
and Seamen of the United States and for carrying on warlike operations against the Regency of Tripoli, and any other of the Barbary
Powers which might commit hostilities against the United States.
Whereupon the President directed to be put in Commission, to be
under the Command of Commre S. Barron, the following Vessels,

President
Congress
Essex
ConsteUation
J . Adums - Store Ship, armed en Flute.
The President further directed that the United States' Vessels of
War in the Mediterranean under Commodore Preble, consisting of,

Condibution, Siren Brig, Argus Brig, Vben Schooner, Nautilus
Schooner, Enterprize Schooner, should be under the Command of
Commodore Samuel Barron.
On the 26 June 1804 the John Adam left the Capes and on the
5 July was followed by the Squadron which appeared off Tripoli the
beginning of September. On the lot@Commodore PrebIe resigned to
Comr"mon
the Command of the joint Squadron and returned to
the United States in the John Aakms. The Season being too far advanced for another attack on Tripoli
the Squadron was detached diffe~entways to protect our Commerce.
The Government having received information of the probable advantages of a co-operation with Hamet the ExBashaw of Tripoli
appointed William Eaton Esqr Agent for the Barbary Powers, to be
under the orders of Commodore Barron. M! Eaton took passage for
the Mediterranean on board the P~esident,& in Novr Sailed for Alexandria in Egypt in search of Hamet, who had joined the fortunes of
the Beys. Having proved successful in discovering & extricating the
ExBashaw from Egypt, M' Eaton with Lt OBannon of the Marines,
M i d s w a n n & Peck and some few other Americans, traversed the
Deserts of Lybia and on 15 Ap! [1805] arrived a t Bomba a Town about
120 Miles to the Eastward of the East Cape of the Gulf of Sidra and
there made a stand for the purpose of making arrangements with
the Squadron and collecting the Adherents of Hamet. Having collected 500 Arabs, Mr Eaton with 10 Marines, a Company of Greek
Christians, Lieu! OBannon $ Mids? Mann advanced with Hamet and
on 27 April 1805 attacked and took, in conjunction with the Argus,
LVaut&s, and Horneb, the Town of Derne in the Province of the same
Name. In this action M' Eaton was shot through the wrist, & Lt
OBannon & M: Mann planted the American Colours on the Walls.
Jussuf the Reigning Bashaw of Tripoli having received Information
of Mr Eston's movements dispatched a force against him which
arriving after the surrender of Derne, attacked & drove the Troops
of Hamet posted before the place but were finally repulsed from works
thrown up by the Americans. Several other Skirmishes took place
alike unfortunate to the Tripolitrtns. M' Eaton and his party were
then preparing to advance to Bengazi, but the Bashaw alarmed a t
the ill fortune of his Arms, threatened by the Squadron in front, and
dreading the progress of Mr Eaton, made overtures of peace through
the Spanish Consul a t Tripoli.
On the 226 May 1805 Commodore Barron resigned to Cspt John
Rodgers the Command of the S uadron, his I11 Health having incapacitated him from the duties the Station.
In May, the Government dispatched to the support of the Squadron,
Gun Boats h T P 2?3, 4, 5? 6, 7 , 8 , 9, & 10, which were soon followed by
the Spitfire and Vengeance, Bomb-Ketches.
The overtures of Peace having been received from the Bashaw of
Tripoli, Consul General Lear was sent from Malta to Tripoli, to
adjust the terms of pacScation: After a short time spent in discussion, Mr Lear offered his ultlrnatum which was accepted by the
Bashaw and on the 3 6 June 1805, PEACE
was made and signed. The
following are the preliminary articles,

01

WSL

I. There shall be a firm and issting Peace upon Principles of reciprocal
advantage.
11. The Exchange of Prisoners, man for man, and the payment of Sixty

SIR I am honored with a letter from the Secretary of the Navy
dated the 22d May, notifying me that you have been sent into these
seas to supersede me in the command of the U. S. Squadron - I have
therefore to request your permission to return to the United States
in such ship as you may think proper to allow me for that purpose The State & condition of this ship is such as to make it necessary
that she should go into Port to be thoroughly recaulked & her rigging
refitted - This ought to be done as soon as possible: in her present
situation she ought not to be exposed to the Hazard of a heavy gale
of wind, which we have.good reason soon to expect If not inconsistent wlth your plans of operation I wish your permission to go to Messina, Syracuse & Malta in her, to settle the
accounts of the Squadron & deposit the military stores loaned by the
Neapolitan Government - I t will also be necessary that I visit
Palermo & Naples in the Ship in which I return home to settle the
accounts of the Squadron at those places If you will please to appoint an officer to command this Ship, the
arrangements for delivering her up can be made either a t .Syracuse,
Messina or Malta & in the mean time the necessary repam can be
made about the Hull & rigging - I wish you health, Success &

SIR,the written orders, I here hand you, to proceed to the port of
Alexandria or Smyrna for the purpose of convoying to Malta any
vessels you may find there, are intended to disguise the real object
of your expedition; which is to proceed with Mr Eaton to Alexandria in
search of Homet Bashaw, the rival brother and legitimate sovereign
of the reigning Bashaw of Tripoli; and to convey him and his suitle]
to Derne or such other place on the coast as may be determined the
most proper for co-operating with tlle naval force under my command
against the common enemy: or, if more agreeable to him, to bring
him to me before Tripoli Should Homet Bashaw- not be found a t Alexandria, you have the
discretion to proceed to any other place for him where the safety of
your ship can be, in ?our opinion, relied upon.
The Bashaw may be assured of the support of my squadron a t
Bengazi or Derne; where you are at liberty to put in, if required, and
if i t can be done without too great risque. And you may assure him
also that I will take the most effectual measures with the forces under
my Command for co-operating with him against the usurper, his
brother; and for re-establishing him in the regency of Tripoli. Arrangements to this effect with h i are confided to the discretion with

TANGIER
15tb Sept: 1804. NO 82. - Duplicate. SIR N? 81 conveyed copy of my correspondence with Sidy Muhammed Selawy last Month. - I have not yet received any answer to
my Letter of the 26*",ut
my Friend at Rhabat advises me he had
read and explained it to him on the 2d Instant. - Captain Rodgers
went off Salk and at his return here on the 27th Ult? acquainted me
the Emperours three Ships had retired within the Bar of that River. As I knew that could not be done at this dry season of the year, until
a great part of their Artillery and Stores had been taken out, I was
induced to believe it had been determined they should be laid up. On this principle I did not see cause to offer any objection to the
strong desire Captain Rodgers expressed of joining Commodore
Barron.
By many subsequent advices it however appears the Ships did not
go within the Bar at any time since they assembled in Sall6 Road, and
that they put to Sea on the 30th August. - Captain Rodgers m i s ~
take must have proceeded from his not being acquainted with the
distance the Barrs lay from the apparent entrance of the River. The destination of these Ships is not certainly known, but generaly
supposed to be for Lisbon, and that the two largest are to be Coppered
and new rig'd there. On Tuesday last the Essex arrived here from Gibraltar. Captain
[James] Barron also expressed a wish to go to the Commodore, under
an Idea that his Services were no longer necessary here.
As we had no certainty of the destination of the Frigates, I gave it
as my oppinion it would be proper to ascertain that before he left us,
and I presume he is gone to the Westward in that view. - I cannot
but express my regret that other services should seem to these Gentlemen so urgent as to enduce this Station being left without any Vessel
of War, since by experience we have so fully seen the advantages
arise from a contrary conduct. I have now to advise that a sum of money in Spanish Gold said to
be about One hundred and forty thousand dollars arrived here this
morning, appropriated by Muley Soliman for encreasing his Marine. I t goes to Lisbon in a Portuguese Brig of War, as is pretended for
purchase of Naval and Ordnance Stores and Building Materials for
Sea Service. This measure so unexpected and unprecedented in this Country to
such an extent, must proceed from some imperious motive. - In my
oppinion the report of this money being destined for the purpose
mentioned, merits no sort of attention; besides many other arguments
might be offered for this being the case, it is notorious Muley Solirnan

26

has no Arsenals or Magazines for the deposit of such a quantity of
Stores. - I have not a doubt but we shall find the chief object in
view, is the purchase of Armed Vessels, with probably some essential
articles of Naval and Ordnance Stores; particularly Gun Powder; of
which the Emperour has but a very slender stock at this time. - I
have requested Consul Jarvis to be watchful on their opperations a t
Lisbon and to give you and Commodore Barron the earliest intelligence
thereof. The two Galleys of Tetuan have layen in this Mole perfectly
inactive for these last fifteen days. - during that time we have had a
fresh Gale a t East, with very little intermission. [NA. SDA.

deliver my Stores, and from thence to the United States, touching at
the Different Ports on the North Side of the Miditerranean to afford
Convoy.
You will perceive by my Instructions that I was first to go to Malta,
but the Commodore gave me verbal Orders afterwards to proceed
with the Gun Boats that I had in tow to this Place, in Company with
the Syren, Nautilles and Enterprize, where we all arrived Yesterday
Evening with all the Gun Boats and Bombards on a very short

15 September 1804.1. the result of deliberations after having advised
with and consulted Commodore Preble before Tripoli (Porcile released by the Government. Why?-) Commodore Barron
declares he does not consider any construction of the President's
instructions will justify him in furnishing cash, arms and amrnunition to Hamet Bashaw - I hoped, in some measure to remedy this
inconvenience by applying to that use cash which I expected to realize
on a claim I have against the Chevalier Antonio Porcile of Sardinia
for payments made as his surety, at Tunis, some years ago on account
of cash borrowed by him for the purpose of ransoming his daughter
Anna Maria Porcile - But I am astonished to learn, by the tenor
of his letter to the President, that he considers himself released from
this debt by an act of the Government of the United States - This
conclusion of his is, to me, altogether enigmatical; but I presume it
a misconstruction on his part of some instructions, unknown to me,
communicated to my successor at Tunis touching the release of the
chevalier's daughter from detention on account of his obligations However the fact may be, it has disappointed my last resort for the
means of assisting the operations of the plan in which I am at length
formally engaged - I am therefore compelled to draw on the Navy
de artment, on account of my salary, for the sum of one thousand
doears in order to meet the contingencies of my voyage to Alexandria,
and to aid me in putting that plan in motion (Rejerence to Comm? Preble d Con. OBrien.) I forbear adding
any thing to my former observations to government on the subject
of this cooperation - Commodore Preble and Consul OBrien, who
will be at Washington, will better satisfy enquiry whether my calculations concerning it have been correct and my arrangements judicious:
as they will also be the best commentators on my own statement to
Congress concerning my general agency on the coast of Barbary I cannot forbear, however, expressing, on this occasion, the extreme
mortification I suffer on account of my actual situation; destitute of
commission, rank, or command; and, I may say, consideration or
credit. And even without instructions for the regulation of my
conduct while ostensibly charged with the management of an enterprise on which, perhaps, depends the successful issue of this war. I
am not ignorant that I ought to ascribe this mortifying situation, as a
remote cause, to the indirect, undue influence of Captain Murray's
insinuations - There is not one statement made by Murray, relative
to Barbary affairs, in which my agency has been implicated and calculated to invalidate my truth and throw suspicion on my integrity,
but what has proved incorrect m matters of fact, if not maliciously
false; yet it has required the testimony of an experiment to work
conviction of his misrepresentations, and the force of demonstration
to do away the injurious impressions they stamped on the belief of
his powerful friends. In the issue I have been materially wronged,
both in my reputation and circumstances; so, indeed, has the public
service. - But, while I have a right to feel indignation towards his
hypocricy, and a regret for the influence it had over measures; I owe

34

nevertheless, to the candor with which you have listened to my statements, to the confidence you have placed in them, and to the uniform
inclination you have manifested towards the system of operations I
would have recommended, the sincerest acknon-ledgements.
And I beg you will be assured, Sir, that this confidence shall not be
disappointed; for, besides the concern I feel that my fellow citizens
in slavery as well as the general interest of my country should be
benefitted by the success of the enterprise now in view, there is s
bond upon my honor which I shall take care to discharge - Hamet
Bashaw is the only man in existence to whom I ever plight.ed my faith
without having succeeded in acquitting myself of the engagement However forlorn therefore the prospect before me may present itself
I am determined to place my breast in this unintentional breach of
good faith, and thus convince him and the world that though, as an
American, I may be unfortunate, as such, I cannot be unfaithful.
If my project succeed, the government will take the benefit of a
miracle;for I have, a t present, very little reason to ground its prospect
of success on ordinary agencies - If it fail, government sacrifices
nothing; though my family may feel a sacrifice - But I shaII continue
still to indulge the hope that some provisions, proportionate to the
magnitude of the object, will yet be made to assist my exertions before
the season for decisive operations commence next spring The requisite field artilery and small arms may be procured a t
Malta, and of the king of the two Sicilies: They did not come on
board at Hampton as was expected - A small fund should be established also at Malta on which requisitions may be made to answer
unavoidable necessities - I believe fifty thousand dollars will be
sufficient to the purpose (27vee U7beat prizes -) Three large polacca ships, laden with wheat,
have been captured attempting to enter the blockaded port of Tripoli,
and sent into Maltma,
within a few days - The cargoes amount, in all,
to about thirty six thousand bushels - This providential supply might
serve a ration to an equal number of arabs about seventy or eighty
days; and might be used as a most effectual bribe to detach those
prizes could be
famishing forces of the enemy from his interest, if t,l~e
adjudicated upon in season. I have no doubt of their being IegaIly
condemned, as the masters wnfess they knew of the blockade, and as
they were intercepted standing directly into port within an hours
sail (Fit time to treat with Tunis -1 I regret that I have not powers to
sieze this moment of distress a t Tunis to modify our treaty with the
Bey so as to place our intercource with that regency on the footing of
the most favored nations. I t may not be too late next year. On
the contrary, a successful termination of our controversy with Tripoli
will facilitate the event.
I sail tomorrow for Alexandria. If I can t,hereraise a small number
of mamlukes and embark them a t Egypt I intend to surprise Bengazi
on my return, if the place should be found accessible, bring off the
Governor, and place a garrison there of the troops of Hamet Bashaw Though under no injunctions to make communications officially,

Such was arrangement a t the date of the preceding. The Argus
returned into this port on the 236 inst., after having repaired a t
Messina. Found here the President, Constitution, John Adams,
Vben & Enterprize. The Congress, Constellation and Nautilus having
been ordered off Tripoli, and no account of them since a very severe
gale on the 20. 21. @ [&I 23d the Argus is dispatch in search of them;
and, of course, the expedition to Alexandria suspended - The Commodore tells me she will proceed thither immediately on her return
into port Information will be undoubtedly communicated by the ordinary
reports of the very imperfect state of health which has compelled
Commodore Barron to take lodgings on shore - His physician, Doc.
Cutbush, has been under serious apprehensions of alarm for him,
and, it seems, is not yet wholly relieved from them. I t appears
to me very improbable that he will be able to keep the sea this winter - And, I much fear, will not have sufficient health to transact the
business necessarily preparatory to the operations of next spring and
summer - Much is to be done which requires health and assiduity.
I cannot but repeat my earnest wish that something more explicit
may be expressed in the Cornr" instructions, and correspondent provisions made, concerning the aids to be advanced Hamet Bashaw,
in case this chief can be used to our advantage - He is cautious in
using a discretion on the subject - &, 1 believe, determined in any
situation of the Bashaw's affairs not to furnish any supplies without
special instructions.
Previously to leaving America
(Reform the consular character -)
I thought it my duty to suggest to the proper departments some
changes, which seemed indispensible with our national dignity, in the
consular appointments on the Mediterranean coast. I am still more
than ever convinced of the oecessity of the measure - The character
of our Government suffers through those representatives; so would
our interests if agents were not substituted to execute the duties properly attached to thcir offices - Mr Appleton a t Leghorn, though
harmless, wants character;
Barnes, at Sicily, probity; Mr Pulis, a t
Malta, national attachment and fealty; and Mr Matthieu, a t Naples,
wants every thing.
The navy agents a t those places appear to be judiciously selected I believe they would not disappoint the confidence of the President if
the national seal were placed in their hands - And, as they have the
laboring oar, it seems but reasonable they should enjoy the honor
& the profit of this confidence I have suspended the negociation of the bills mentioned on the 18.
ult. until the brig shall proceed aloft.
Allow me to repeat the assurance
of my perfect respect

(Advantages of co-operation with Hamet Bashaw)
Apparent advantages of co-operating with the deposed Bashaw of
Tripoli against the Usurper
l t By investing Tripoli in the rear, through the co-operations of
Hamet Bashaw, we cut off the enemy's retreat from the country and
effectually prevent him recieving supplies from any quarter whatever2@ Dread of retaliation, when thus invested, will deter the enemy
from treating our captives with cruelty 36 I n case of a close investment, the inhabitants of the city, seeing
their retreat cut off in the rear, will be very apt to open their gates to
the beseigers, to receive their legitimate sovereign, and to surrender
the usurper to punishment. We should thus get possession of the
enemy's person and suit; and our captives would be restored to us
without ranson 4th Preliminaries of peace are already agreed upon with Hamet
Bashaw, on our own terms; &, when definitely concluded, will, most
likely be permanent: for, if gratitude on his part be not a sufficient
guarantee, we hold his brother and chief admiral, Lisle, as hostages;
who may be used to turn the tables upon him whenever he becomes
faithless.
5tP The experiment will cost us very little, even if it fail of success;
nor shall we loose any ground by the failure; we shall then have the
enemy in the same position as at presentThe success of the
measure will save both life and cash: articles well worth economy in
a country where there is no redundancy of either. The general as
well as particular advantages to the United States equal all they coud
possibly realise from the most effectual coercion 6 % But to sum up all considerations in one, which ought to weigh
down all others, the faith of the United States is pledged to the friendly
Bashaw, by letter from M' Madison to me, by engagements of legitimate Agents of the United States and by conventions of several of
our commanders - By adhering to these engagements, we certainly
have the advantage of keeping faith and supporting a dignity of
character which would impress a high sense of our national perseverance and honor on the minds of the other Barbary regencies, as well
as to revive that sentiment among nations whose good opinion is more
to be desired (Disadvantages of acting against Tripoli without Harnet Bashaw)
Probable disadrantages of acting without his co-operation 1 % No doubt the enemy's town may be battered to the ground;
but he has a retreat in the rear.
2@ Our fellow citizens in captivity will most likely be placed on
the ramparts of the enemy's batteries and forced not only to expose
their breasts to our shot, but to fight against us; while we are compelled
to the painful alternative of cutting down the ranks of our own
brethren to get access to the enemy
36 I n case of forcing an evacuation of the tou-, by a bombardment, the enemy having a retreat in the rear, it neither secures to us
the release of our captives, nor our own terms of peace: the captives
will be carried away to the mountains, and pacification will be delayed
or evaded -

4 4 But should the enemy either find himself reduced to the necessity of yielding to terms; or prevailed on by policy to come to an
accommodation, his faith is an insufficient guarantee to the peace:
he will violate it as soon as he can do it with probable advantage and
security: examples are tpo numerous to leave the conjecture doubtful
The experiment is sure to cost us some expense of blood; and,
most probably, some sacrifice of time and money by the damages our
shipping may sustain; which would a t this moment be more sensibly
felt as we are threatned with war by a nation against whom all our
naval resourses would be reqdred, and might be more profitably
employed - But if defeated in the experiment the enemy gains a
decided advantage Whereas even the success of the measure would
fall short of the beneficial effects which might be secured at less hazard;
as it would leave us in perpetual apprehensions from the enemy's
known perfidy; as well as from the possible event of restoration of the
legitimate Bashaw, who would thus become a decided enemy 6 th Totally to abandon our engagements with the friendly Bashaw
because the indecision, inactivity, or bad generalship of certain of our
late commanders may have left him in a dubious situation would
stamp the shade of an equivocal mind on our government, which
would inflict a wound on the national sensibility and a blemish on our
portrait To Com. Barron 21. Aug. 1804.

EXHIBITB. to letter of Sep. 18
Is it not more consistent with the dignity and interest of the United
States to expend money in reducing than in pacifyin an open enemy?
With half the sum authorized, according to Co one1 Lear, to be
given for a precarious peace with the reigning Bashaw of Tripoli,
applied to assist the legitimate sovereign, the usurper may be made
prisoner; an honorable and permanent peace secured; and this expence saved to the United States by the re-embursement of Hamet
Bashaw Mr OBrien is decidedly in the opinion that this plan may be easily
effected. He says the rightful Bashaw- has a powerful party in Tripoli:
that the usurper has spread the report of his death with a view of
baffling their hopes; and that, in order to attack their superstition
and their desparation to his cause, he inculcates the idea into his
subjects that the Americans are infidels and savages, canibals and
monsters of cruelty - Whereas, were their lawful sovereign shown to
them in our fleet, with assurances that we are neither at war with their
religion nor their repose; but that we respect both, and seek nothing
more than that justice which would restore them to peace and to
their proper allegiance, the very soldiery called to the defence of the
enemy, would desert him and take an opposite part: the Arabs are
generally in favor of the friendly Bashaw - This opinion is general
where the circumstances are known But if fighting alone can secure our honor, I should nevertheless
object to taking a vicious horse by the heels when we have a bridle
In his mouth and can sieze the reins! Besides, it is the success of a
measure, more than the mode of effecting it, which secures public

To Secretary of the Navy from Captain William Bainbridge, U. S. Navy

NEW-YORK, 12th February, 1806.
SIR - In compliance with your letter of the 6th instant, which this
day came to hand, I hasten to detail the services rendered to the crew
of the United States' late frigate PhiJadelphia, by Nicholas C. Nissen,
Esq. his Danish l\1ajest,y1sconsul residing there.
In consequence of the mode of imprisonment, it was impossible for
the officers to procure the necessary articles of subsistence. They
were therefore necessitated to receive their daily provision, &c.
through another channel. Mr. Nissen generously offered his services
to obtain our necessary supplies, which he did in the most faithful
manner, for nineteen months and three days, the period of our captivity, and at times when the funds placed a t my command in Tripoli
were expended, he continued our daily supply by his own means,
until ours were renewed by the commodore of the Mediterranean
squadron, or George Davis, Esq. charge des affaires a t Tunis, to whom
we are ~ r e a t l yindebted.
Had it not been for the friendly aid of consul Nissen, we should
not have received our subsistence in so regular a manner as we did,
and should have been exposed at a great expense to the impositions
of the lowest class of our memy. His attentions were not confined
solely to the officers, but were equally extended to the seamen and
soldiers.

Consul Nissen was the first Christian we saw after landing on the

with the philanthropy of a man of feeling, and immediately administered to our wants, by sending provision and bedding from his
house, and ameliorated as much as possible our truly unpleasant
situation.
I carnot, in justice to his attention, omit mentioning a circumstance which shows the lively interest he took in our situation, and
the hazard he ran to serve us. When commodore Preble attacked
Tripoli, Mr. Nissen's house was as much exposed as any in the town,
and himself in danger from the bombardment. I solicited him frequently to leave his dangerous situation, and retire to the gardens,
where the consuls were. He requested me not to importune him more
to leave the town, for he preferred running the risk of the shot and
shells from our squadron, and attending to our wants, to resorting to
the gardens. In thus ursuing the dictates of a feehng mind, he was
very near losing his li e by a shot from the Consitution: Had he not
acted in this friendly manner towards us, it is very probable we should
have been several days without provisions, as the enemy were occupied and exasperated.
I have, sir, detailed to you generally, the services rendered to the
officers and crew of the Philadelphia, at Tripoli, by Nicholas C. Nissen,
Esq. but it is impossible for me to convey a just sense of them. Nothing but a perfect acquaintance with our situation, and the aid we
received, can truly estimate the services rendered.

Secretary of the Navy.
Having received this information, Congress passed the following
resolution:
Resolved by the Senate and House o Representatives o f the United

To Colonel Dwight from Willism Eaton, U. 8. Navy Agent for the Barbary Regencies

MALTA
Sep. 20 ch 1804
SIR,Commodore Barron's squadron arrived here on the 5Fn and fell
in with Commodore Preble off Tripoli on the gtb instant - The
enterprize of this judicious and gallant commander has effected astonishment here. You will undoubtedly have the facts in detail before
the public. With the small force under his command he has stamped
an impression on the Barbary mind which will not be erased this
generation and has restored the charracter of our arms to its proper
consideration among the ne~ghbouringnations - As evidence of this
conclusion I extract the following paragraph from a letter addressed
to the Commodore by a distinguished commander in the british navy
whose abilities and valor have raised him to high rank, great eminence,
and to the government of the most important port in this sea - [*I

This encomium has the more weight as it comes from a quarter too
independent to use adulation, and very capable of judging of the
merit of brilliant actions The Pope of Rome expresses himself on the subject - "The American
Commander, with a small force and in a short space of time, has done
more -for the cause of Christianity than the most powerful nations qf
Christendom have done .for ages!" I firmly believe the Holy Father is
correct. If I could obtain as handsome a certificate, and as fairly,
I should be apt to be very indifferent about an absolution for past
sins, and should be in danger of being so about committing fresh
ones - But this is a kind of selfish, sinful sentiment in which you
can take no interest - I %illassure you therefore, as I know you will
share the pride I feel on this occasion, that an American is no longer
ashamed of an American Uniform here - And that a Barbary cruiser
pews an American flag in this sea with as much caution as a scullung
debtor does a deputy sheriff in our country - The Bey of Tunis
twists his mustaches in sullen amazement. Dispair broods frowningly
on the dark brow of the pirate of Tripoli - And the whole coast of
these regencies seem astonished with the forebodings of uncommon
curses; for its is an inauspicious omen, but now known to them, that
the order of things should be so inverted that Christians should be
seen carrying Turks by the board, and Turks flying before Christians,
an hundred to one superior in number and on their own ground Hamet Bashaw is still in a situation to be brought on the enemy's
rear - I am now bound to Alexandria to arrange with him a plan of

co-operations; and in about forty days I hope to. organizing my
Saracen militia on the plains of Lybia in order to brlng them to the
field early next spring. If suitable supplies are furnished for this
enterprise I form sanguine expectations of realizing all my calculations
on this project. If these supplies are with held I shall be compelled
to draw on the enthusiasm of Arabian resentment and bigotry as a
substitute for field artilery, muskets, musket catridges, flints &c.
&c. - for I shall not abandon the object.
You will have an acquaintance with Commodore Preble - He has
too well distinguished himself to need private introductions - And
his talents are too. conspicuous to make i t necessary for me to say
that such an acquamtance is an acquision - Yet I cannot with-hold
from you an expressipn of my serious apprehensions that, however
justly we may appreciate the valor and abilities of his successor, the
service will suffer from his retiring - The unbounded confidence the
officers on the station have in his capacities as a commander, and the
very marked regrets they manifest a t his leaving it, render this apprehension natural without detaching any thing from the merits due to
the manly and amiable disposition of Commodore Barron [*See letter to Commodore Preble from Sir Alexander John Ball, Governor of
Malta, dated 20 September 1804.1

seeing you before your return to America I beg to repeat my congratulations on the services you have rendered your country, and the hair breadth escapes you have had in
setting so distinguished an example to your countrymen whose bravery
and enterprize cannot fail to mark the character of a great & rismg
nation in a manner that will be ultimately attended with the best &
most important consequences to your country If I were to offer my humble opinion i t would be, that you have
done well in not purchasing a peace with money - A few brave men
have been sacrificed; but they could not have fallen in a better cause:
and I even conceive i t better to iisk more lives than to submit to
terms which might encourage the Barbary States to add fresh demands & insults

TOSecretary of State from George Davis, U. S. Charge d'Affaires, Tunis

TUNISS e ~ t r 2 6 1804.
~@
SIR, I am this day honored with your letter of the 8t@of June,
apprising me of the decision of His Exc? the President, relative to our
affairs in these Seas. - If a considerable procrastination, of the war,
should not vary the views of Government, our labours will ultimately
be crowned with Success; - but such an important object, cannot be
acquired, in one campaign -.The actlve and Successful operations of
Commodore Preble, with a single frigate, against the whole forces of
Tripoli, could not fail to have impressed on the mind of the Bashaw,
just Sentiments of respect and fear, for that Nation, which has
hitherto, been placed as the most insignificant of Powers - This in
itself is not SufEcient - The Secret adviser, (or Prime Minister) of
every Barbary Prince,.musf, necessarily be the POLITICAL ENEMY of
the Power at war; and invanably one, whose Situation enables him to
make such calculations "on the expences" objects to be acquired possible
result &c. &c. as ought to have the greatest weight, in directing the
decisions of the Chief. - M' BEAUSSIER
(than whom, none can so well
make known, the Bashaw's mtentions) in his letter to Cornmod?
Preble, Slightly touching on this Subject, is most unquestionably
correct My opinions relative to the affairs of Tripoli, have not of late
been Suggested; from a conviction that those whose immediate duty
it was to report on this subject, were Men of years, fill'd with wisdom
and experience; and consequently had made known every circumstance, which could have any hfluence; in h i n g the determination of
His Exc? the President - I beg leave to offer one remark, and the

NAI7AI, OPERATIONS FROM 1804 TO 1805

force of which is so apparent, that i t ought. to have some weight,
dt2101 coming from me.
The Commander in Chief of ,our present
formidable forces (formidable for acting against such an mslgnificant
enemyj or whomever else is empower'd to conclude the*peace Should never offer t m s but once; these terms bemg rejected, no
apparent Success of Arms, should induce us renew them, far wben
they are to be accepted, the Bashaw will r e a d y devise means to make
it known.
Every offer that is made him, not only adds to his Insolence; but Increases his pretentions in a double ratio he has heretofore (except within a few months) lau hed a t the war; and even yet
considers the present armament ss a %:bear,
to purchase a cheaper
these opinions should be corrected, by convincing him that
peace
their object is no lees, than the perfect a d a t i o n of his Go+; and
in order to enforce such a belief; and permit the other Regencies to
draw Sdutary.deductions for themselves; our military operations
should not be Interrupted by vain attempts to treat for the peace;
but should be continued viith a Zed, and activity equal to producing
such an event I some time since Suggested to Commodore Preble, that the most
expedient & effective means to release our People, would be to treat
for their ransom, with some power, which has a real interest in such
c ~ nevent. - This Regency offers a field for the negociation. - The
Bashaw of Tripoli, owes about 120,000$ to the Tunisien Govt; Their only hopes of r e c e i ~ git, are founded on the possible result of
OW war - As Tripoli's crown from the position of the Countries
&c. &c - is very dependant on this Prince; and his love of gold so
well known; we might expect that the most decisive measures, would
be taken, to Secure that, which he now considers as nearly lost - The
~h,$&!dhia would have been received in part payment; this by an
unprece lated act of Bra~ery,n-e have fortunately done away - The
B8taia;a & Swedish Regdias are nearly exhausted; and a great proportion of the amount he calwlates receiving from the U. States, d
be necessary for defraying the expences incurred by the War abstracted from these powerful motives, it is the real interest of this
Govi that a Speedy peace should take place; and (a part) of our forces
withdrawn from these Seas, because they are not only view'd as the
Rodjor a peenish child; - but stimulate the adjacent powers to follow
our noble example - by combiniq such a negociation, with a final
adjustment of our affairshere; I thlnk the whole expences would not
exceed the calculations made by Gov? - We can have nothing
binding on the part of Tripoli, as a Securjty for future peace, which
wholly dptitute of Commerce, possesses very little interest in its
preservation; and consequently the poorer that Regency is kept, the
more readily will it be satisfied with t d i n g Sacrifices Our affairs have undergone no change, as His Excr the Bey, is
wholly occupied, with devising every possible means, to ward of[fl
the evils, which might have resulted from the scarcity of Grain T e e n Agents. have bee.n sent to the Levant. and almost. every
part of the Mediterranean; and considerable Supplies have already
arrived; which have been purchased by the Govt - and redisposed of
to the ~eopleat the same price - Wheat is 170 to 180, Piastres the
CaEce, Barley 80 to 90 - extreme misery prevails throughout the
interior of the Country; the people subsisting on roots, a little herbage,
and those who can procure it, Oats - God only knows what

the result - effective means (it is said) will be taken to prevent the
Arabs, flying to the City, during the winter The Marabout, is still at the head of his Army near Constantine;
but does not appear to possess SuEcient talents or Courage for so
great an enterprize I t was not a Neapolitan frigate, as stated in my last, which captured the Tunisien Gallies; but a small armament from the Island
of Sardinia No advises have been received from Captain Bainbridge, these two
months; I have the honor to annex N Q 1. a copy of my last from
Tripoli In a letter which I had the honour to address you on the 8t3 of
April, you were informed, that the Bey, had refused in the most
decided manner to receive Col. Lear, as one, authorized to transact
public Affairs; and that he would enter into no negotiation of any
kind with any other person than myself - I am still ignorant of the
motives which induced His Excellency to make this declaration this does not prevent the projected visit of the Consul Gen!, with
whom, I shall ever feel a particular pleasure to confer;
(NQ2. is a Copy of a letter addressed to Col. Lear.) I t was however, to be presumed, that all public arangements, should be made
by me; as long as I remain'd Charged with these affairs; and was
honored with any portion of the confidence of Gov* - I never have
Sollicited from His Excv the President, a confirmation of my appointment; or from the Honbiethe Secr of State, an extention of my powers;
nor could any regrets have been felt, by the immediate arrival of a
new Consul; as implicit obedience to the orders of my Superiors, has,
& I trust ever will characterize my ublic de ortment.
Untill His Excellency the Presi ent, sha have commissioned a
Consul to Succeed me here; I beg you to be assured on the forfeit of
that honor, which is dearer to me than lije; that the Interests of the U.
States, shall never be neglected; or its dignity, in any way lessened that a Scrutinising examination of my deportment here, will prove ax
honourable to myself, as I vainly imagined it was advantageous to
my Country - I have remained nineteem months in this Regency,
at the Sacrifice of my health; and personal feelings, from the puerile
Supposition, that my Services a t Tunis, were particularly necessary How far I am justified in these assertions, every individual, who h a
had any public concerns (for the last year) direct or indirect with this
Regency, can too well testify.
There being no emolument annexed to this Consuk&, it never can
be desireable, excepting on the Score of warmest patriotism.
I feel well Satisfied of receiving the excuses of the Honblethe Sec?
of State for these remarks - while I have ever attached a high value
to all public emplopents; - and an unbounded Zeal in my Country's
Service; I also possess a proportional respect for myself, in the full
exercise of the duties of any Office I may hold; even when obtained
by accident, or casualty With Sentiments of profound Respect and Consideration, I have
the honor to be,

Bibbs to four feet below the decayed place, which will make the mast
perfectly strong As it does not affect the principal Front and Side fishes of the

as well as another packet for Capt. B. sent from you the 6th of AugtPray Sir, send your letters, under the cover of Mr Holck - the
couriers always present the letters here with saying, this is from
Veckil American, thereby it is known that there are letters from you;
when unknown I shall sometimes be able to get them to Capt. B. Capt. B. has been sick, but is better, he has often wrote to you &ct.
but his letters have not been forwarded. Inclosed is a small paper for
Commodore P. from Ca t. B. - New rigors have not been used in
consequence of the attaci, I dont think it hardly possible - Many of
the Officers have been sick & are so, but I believe of a fever with pains
in limbs, every body has felt here as contagious; not above 3 or 4,
days neither dangerous; but Lord knows from what.
I candidly must tell you that all the attacks the Squadron except
that of 3q Augt have had very little effect & the damage done is
absolutely of no consequence. I recq a ball in a Belvedere, which had
it come 3, minutes sooner had killed me for my curiosity, not I only
had a star in a looking glass - I have wrote a note to MT Biddle,
informing him that a Gentleman in Tunis had opened a credit for him,
hereby the young Gentleman can at least make use if his friends
endeavours even should he lose their letters.
Let M' Holck, explain to you my letters about your Affairs. Danish
is almost a cypher; I hope you have r e d my letter of 10, Sept. - I
wrote much to Mr Holck, about our affairs, & gave freely my opinion,
it may be wrong in conclusion; ut not in good will.

Tripoli, many vessels enter there from the Levant with powder &ct.
The 27tWept. went out a Cruiser, a boat with one gun, another

Q* October 1804.DEARSIR I am induced to send by way of Leghorn accompanying
Triplicate of my last respects, as I have no advice of the original or
duplicate having reached Gibraltar. - The Captain of an English

Frigate reported he saw three Ships entering the Tagus, which he
supposed to be the Emperours Frigates. I have not seen the Essex since the 1l t h Ult? The Tetuan Galleys have retired within the Bar of that [Ms mutilated] and will no doubt be laid up, as usual during winter. Muley Solimans money was not shipt as intended for Lisbon,
orders were sent to invest it in Bills of Exchange on that City and
London, which has been in part done. We do not yet know the precise Service this money is destined for,
but it is generaly believed to be the purchase of small Armed Vessels
at Lisbon and London. I t is still intended the Agents in this busyness shall go first to
Lisbon. - What they may do there Mr Jarvis will advise you of, but it
may not be so easy a matter to watch their opperations in London. In consiquence of the privailing Sickness in Gibraltar and Cadiz, no
Vessel whatever from those Ports are admitted here, but Humanity
called on us to allow the provision Boats of the former to receive their
Cargoes in quarantine, under certain precautions. [Mrs. James S. Barron Col.]

6tQOctober l S O 4 . SIR With this I have the honour to enclose triplicate of N Q83. Advice has this day been received that on the 2gtQ Septc His Imperial
Majestys Frigate Maimona returned to Salle with a Prussian Ship and
Brig bound from Lisbon to Amsterdam and Antwerp, captured off
the Coast of Portugal. The Captain of the Maimona reports that the other Frigate of same
name and the Mirboha entered the Tagus before he took these
Prizes. - We have advice from Gibraltar to the 4Q Inst when the
daily deaths had gone near t o a hundred. -A cordon has been thrown
round Cadiz in consequence of Orders from the SupremeBoard of Health
a t Madrid, who have declared the prevailing Siclrness there to be
what they stile the Epidemic. This Country enjoys good health, but we have scarce had an
hours rain for these five Months past, which is an alarming circumstance. 7t@October. - This morning the two Moors appointed to employ
the sum of money appropriated by Muley Soliman for augmenting
His Navy, arrived here from Tetuan and are to embark on a Ragusem
Polacre in a few days for Lisbon. By a Boat just arrived from Gibraltar advice is recieved the
deaths had gone as far as one hundred and Sixty in a day, - it is
with concern I have heard (but not by Letters to myself) that Mr
Gavino is of the number. In such case I trust Government will find
in the American House of Khun & Green established there, a Successor meriting its confidence [NA. SDA. CL,Tangier, Vol. 2, Jan. 1803-Oct. 1810.1
To Secretary of State from William Jarvis, U. S. Conanl, Lisbon, Portugal

Duplicate
LISBON6th October 1804
SIR The original of the foregoing I had the honor to forward you
by the Schooner Cabinet, Captain Martin, Via Marblehead, since
which I have been twice alongside the Essex. It appears the object
of her Visit, as I presume the inclosed from Captain Barron to the
Secretary of the Navy will inform Government, is to watch the
motions of the two Moors here.

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS

75

Before I went below the first day I applied to a Lieutenant in the
Portuguese Navy, with whom I am acquainted, to get what information these people had afforded to this Government relative to the real
object of their Visit; it being generally customary for the Commanders
of the Moorish Vessels to inform the Secretary for Foreign Affairs on
their first arrival the object of their visit & at the same time to hand in
a List of what supplies they wish, which is sent to the Director of the
Arsend to furnish. He did me the favour to go immediately to the
Director with whom he was intimate, who informed him that they
reported direct from Sallee & that they had come here to wait for
another Frigate that had sailed the same time, and parted with them
at sea, and asked for nothing but water and fresh stock, both of which
was sent on board & they had not then asked or received any thing
further. This the Gentleman immediately returned & acquainted me
with not thinking it judicious to go with him. They also told him that
the Officers had not on any occasion mentioned where the other frigate
was gone or what her ob'ect was, but had constantly said that their
intentions were not host' e. A declaration of this lund however was
a thing of course - Through two or three channels I have learnt,
that the other frigate who is the Admiral, ordered these two in here for
repairs & that they have no authority to ask for any thing but must
wait the admirals arrival. This seems to correspond with their conduct altho' all the Crew join in the same report that they shall leave
this directly after the arrival of the other. I t is very extraordinary
where the other is gone or what she is after. I hope that learning one
of our frigates had gone into the Streights they have not sent those
two Ships here as a decoy to take up the attention of our other frigate,
to afford their Ship that is out an unmolested opportunity to depredate on our Commerce. I have promised a Barbary Jew a handsome
reward if he would find out why she did not come in with the other
two, where she has gone, & what her object really is. If he does not
succeed, I shall beleive that it is not known, or that the secret is conGned to the first Officers
The frigate is still under quarantine altho' the Providor Mor (ie
the first Officer of Health) promised me four days ago to admit her;
but the next morning he went to Mafra where the Prince now is, and
did not return till yesterday and when applied to for the fulfillment of
his promise; said that he had been instructed so rigidly to attend to
aJl Vessels from Cadiz and Gibralter, where the Government are
advised that the yellow fever has began to rage that he could not do
it. Upon being advised of this I wrote the original of the enclosed
to Mr de Araujo & should have done it four days ago had not I been
averse to trouble the Ministry when I thought there was a probability
of succeeding through another channel. If my request is not complied
with, as the frigate has only five or six sick people on board & they of
diseases b no means suspicious, I shall think it is with a view to make
a merit o it with the Moors, for their manner of quarantining her is
the greatest farce in the world, they having emitted me to go alonside her twice, without an person from the ealth Office in the boat
when the fri ate lays a f mile from the shore & the last time it was
after dark w en I stopped alongside on my return to Lisbon & yesterday I talked with Captain Barron two hours on shore as near as it is
common for persons to stand to-gether in common conversation -

Lisbon, Portugal

His Excellency DONANTONIO
DE ARXUJO
DE AJETEDE
His Royal Highness the Prince Regent Minister and Secretav of Slate
for the Foreign and War Department &c &c &c SIR I have the honor to inform Your Excellency that the American
Frigate Essex, James Barron Esquire, Commander arrived here the
26Q Ult? in 8 days from Cadiz at which port she arrived in the afternoon of the 16tk, got Prattic the 17th & sailed the following Morning;
the Captain, first and second Lieutenants being the only person's
who were on shore out of her, & they did not remain on shore more
than three hours; Her Crew is in remarkable good health for a Vessel
of her size, not having more than three or four seamen sick & they
with colds & slight complaints incident to seamen. She had no cornmunication with any Vessel on her passage, nor has she been at any
other European Port than Gibralter since she left America about 90
days ago: and she left Gibralter four days before a British Sloop of
War that came direct from thence & got Prattic some days since. I
must therefore beg the favour of your Excellency to expedite an
order to admit her to immediate Prattic, she having now laid under
quarantine 10 days the time I understand that it is Customary for
Vessels of War similarly circumstanced.

8 Octr 1804
SIR The Barbary Jew mentioned in the foregoing called on me
yesterday & all he could learn was, that the three frigates had orders
to cruise a month before they came in here, that their object is to repair
the two large ones, that the two in here came in contrary to the
Admirals consent, that for so doing they made an excuse of being much
out of repair, particularly the small one, that the Emperors letter to
the Prince is on board the Admiral & they cannot ask for any thing
untiU he arrives & it is delivered, that they had secret orders to be
broken open in a certain time, but seem'd to think that it was to be
after the frigates were co pered, that they were at war with the
Nations who had an Eag e with legs - meaning the Imperial &
Prussian flag; but did not h o w where the frigate that is out was gone
to Cruise or what she was after. When asked if they were a t war

I'

-

with the Americans they replied, that they were the last year & took
a Vessel by the Emperors orders which he afterwards disowned: being
they were not at present & if the Emperor had any secret intentions of
it, they presumed it would not be put in Execution till after he got
his fleet in order. This story taken to-gether is by no means satisfactory, for the truth is, that it is impossible the large frigate should
have quit the Admiral under pretence of repairs & being leaky: for
she is almost a new Vessel & is in extremely good order in every respect
except the want of copper, & that would not have hindered her from
keeping the sea a month or much longer, and to have disobeyed the
Emperors & Admirals orders without sufficient reason would probably
cost the Captain his head. This excuse might hold good as to the
small one, her hull appearing to be very crazy, altho: her rigging &
sails are in good order. The story of the secret orders seems also
absurd enough, if to be opened after they were repaired & had left
the port; as they could not finish coppering before mid-winter & those
people never cruise in the winter: beside their orders might have followed them by the Portugueze Brig of War that goes between this &
Tangier long before that time: nor does the report correspond with
what they have all along said, that they were all immediately to return
after the arrival of the Admiral, but it agrees very well with what M'
Simpson was informed in this respect. I think the probability is if
there were any secret orders, they were to be opened by the Admiral
before they came in here. The most essential part, as to what the
other frigate is after we are still in the dark about, nor do I much
e.xpect to get any information on this point. I hope that the Mystery
will not be unpleasantly unravelled when it is too late to remedy the
evil
I have not r e d an answer from MT de Araujo & as the advices by
the two last posts state that the yellow fever is raging with great
violence in Gibraltar & Cadiz I am afraid that this alone will be a
sufficient reason for his detention if there is no secret motives Inclosed I have the pleasure to hand you a letter from M: Pinckney

SIR, Our journey from Syracuse to Catania was over a horrid road,
and through an uncultivated rocky country from thence to this place
we had pleasanter prospects; it is well however that we brought our
allowance with us, or we might have starved. You were fortunate
that you did not accompany us, as nothing we met with, could have
compensated for the fatigue of travelling with such wretched cattle,
and the torments suffered from Bugs & Fleas.
The discharging of the Ketch, Gun Boats and Bombs was completed yesterday, and the returns are now making out. The Enterprize
sails tomorrow to join you, and takes the Officers that were in charge
of the Ketch & Boats to join their respective Vessels - Captain Hull
will be ready to sail on Sunday next unless the continuance of rainy
weather prevents - I hope soon to have the pleasure of seeing you a t

if you wish them - I have been requested to make a requisition for

will point out to you the proper channel through which they may be
obtained when I see you - The Neapolitan Governm! are disposed
to render you every assistance in their power.

shall I understand from your saying "that the arrangements already

in your next - I cannot see any reason for our Govt to continue the
war longer than next Summer for the Squadron will then be able to
bring the Bmhaw to as low terms as our present Navy is able to do,
after the operations of the Squadron in the ensuing year, I conceive
our case will be precisely thus - to comply with the terms that can be
got after battering his Town, send an Army, or abandon us entirely to
the hard fate which serving our Country plunged us into. - I recg
your letter of the 23, June, but no enclosures with it - I frequently

that I am Sensible of your attention to our Situation and shall not be
neglectful to keep you informed of it, on two Acet@ one, that you
may advise Government & the other I always feel pleasure in writing
to a friend - I am & have been from . . . . . . . . . that the most proper
way to negotiate a Peace with this Regency is for an American person
properly authorized by his Government with letters of credence to
this. For believe me that Sidi Muhammed Deghies, Minister of
foreign Affairs to the Bashaw of Tripoli, has a just idea of conducting
negociations in a respectable manner. In making peace with these
peopIe we must not consider them as savages, but treat them as a
nation with whom we wish peace. If peace is not the object then
conduct the war with all possible rigour. -No doubt but an American
would [be] permitted to come and remain several days to negociate,
and he might trust himself with safety for I do not believe that this
Government would break its faith in such instances. This opinion of
mine is hastily written, however, from i t you will be able to get my

I understand you are going
to Co'operate with Cidi Achrnet Caromili late Bashaw of Tripoli, as
I forwarded his Dispatches to the American Government and also
wrote concerning his expected assistance, Your Excellency may have
an Answer to those Dispatches.
Commodore Preble last March fixed upon a Plan for the taking
of Derna and Bengazi and to Co,operate with the late Bashaw - his
Consul and me was to have gone to assist in this Business, but after
I had a Vessel with a number of People Engaged for Two Months the
Plan was drop'd, but Should your Excellency approve of taking those
Places now as they are in a State of Famine and some Prizes would
be taken, or if you think of Sending a Vessel to Alexandria first, that
the Bashaw may go by land to take Derna and Bengazi.
As I have given Offence by the Information which I have given to
American Officers and for Assisting those who is Prisoners in Tripoli,
also for recommending the Pilot who assisted in Burning the Philadelphia Frigate, and for many other Services which I have done, these
having been made known has got me a many Enemy there is a
Vessel going to Tripoli also one for Gerba but I belive the Cargo is
for Tripoli. I have had some conversation with those who is well
Accquainted with the Afairs of Tripoli, they Say the People is displeased with the Bashaw and as they are distressed for Grain and will
be more so that the taking of Derna and Bengazi would compleat the
Bashaws Ruin, and those Places can be taken very easily now, and if
the late Bashaws Consul & me can be of any Service Please Command us, we hope this favorable oppertunity will not be looked over

1804.
SIR, This day I was honor'd with your very acceptable letter of
the lltQof June & am extremely happy that my conduct has been
approved by his Excellency the President, the good of the service was
my sole motive, so far as-I wm concerned I have been successful &
my procuring the Gun & Mortar boats at Naples I presume has at
least facilitated the reduction of the Bashaw of Tripoli to reason
The enclosed are copys of letters received with yours from Messrf
Banon and Eaton, I don't subscribe to the latters opinion as I have
been always disposed to let the Barbarian chiefs alone while they
remain friendly to us but when they infringe emsting treatys to chastise
them for their arrogance $ thereby mspne them with a decided dread
of our anns; the Mercury of Nenyork arrived last night in which I
intend to take passage, provided the good of the service prevents m
return in a public ship for I am persuaded from the friendship whicrt
the Comodores professes for me that nothing less will prevent them
from accomodating me. A continental war it seems is inevitable and I am of opinion is
absolutely necessary to restore the ballance of power in Euro e; the
Pope sets out from Rome to crown h s sacred Imperial &ojesty
Napoleone on the 3'd of November thls is reversing the order of things
& does not well accord with the opinion form'd by his holiness when
this same Napoleone turn'd Mussulman in Egypt; what a flexible
faith the little man has acquired! he is notwithstanding a great
general & profound politician; but I thank.providence that since we
have taken possession of Louisiana there 1s between us and him a
gulph! if their was not, I don't thnli we have any occasion to fear
him, but the Bey of Tunis wisely observes that a fly in a mans throat
d'tho i t may not choak him may make him cough!!!
I have not the least doubt but the Emperor of Morocco intended t,o
act as I had the honor to inform you I suspected he would in mine of
the 30tb of November 1803 & that he acts under the infIuence therein
mentioned is an incontrovertible fact; the arrival of the Squadron will
no doubt prevent him for the present & I think Com-arron
has
acted judiciously in leaving the Congress & B s e x to watch the motions
of his piratical squadron until they are dismantled. I have nothing of importance to communicate & continue with
respectful esteem. Pt: St: I omited to observe that the $4000 for which I placed a
credit in Malta Tripoli Naples & Leghorn subject to the order of
Come Preble & Cap? Bainbridge for the use of the Officers & crew of
the Philadelphia has not been drawn for, you will therefore please to
debit me with that sum until h a 3 settlement. INA. SDA. CL, Tripoli, Val 2, June 1801-Bept. 1806.1

TRIPOLI,CASTLEOF THE BASHAW,
in prison Tripoli 16t$October [I8041
DEARSIR, His Highness the Bashaw's Minister of foreign affairs
was so good as to inform us of this opportunity. having obtained
information from a few french papers we had in our possession of your
being called again into actual Service, and destin'd to cruise in these
Seas; induced me once more to resume my pen and communicate to
you the dissagreeable situation in which we are placed at present our
confinement prior to Commodore Preble arrival off this station in the
month of Jul ,was much alleviated by our being permited occasionally
to visit the 6ardens of the Bashaw which is the only satisfaction we
have ever experienced since our captivity. an audience was granted
yesterda forenoon to Capt Bainbridge by the Minister of foreign
affairs w ose conduct to us has been universally that of a Gentlemen
I assure had it not been for this friend our treatment whould have
undoubtedly been more rigourous. at the commencement of our
captivity a parole of honour was promised to be granted us the Minister became our Guarantee, but the Prince not wishing us to have any
communication with our crew put an end to the only pleasure we
could derive from being prisoners in Barbary. Honour so far from
being ingrafted on a [space] mind that they think it impossible for
any of us to remain prisoners when an opportunity offered for an
escape, however there can be no kind of doubt but this is the most
civilized Prince, as well as his Subjects of the Barbary Powers. and as
Such has distinguished himself since our captivity His B. M. Consul. Mr Langford has made application to the Bsshaw
respecting Capt B. remaining a t his house during our captivity, which
I sincerely wish may be granted as he has enjoyed but a very poor
state of health for this four months past.
I fear the liberty I took in addressing you at the commencement of
our imprisonment has not met with your approbation. if so I beg. you
let me know so that I may desist from troubleing you agam, I

do not scruple to say my motives for writing were from the unremited
attention shewn me the short time I had the honour of being placed
under your command. in fact I look'd upon you as a friend more than
a Commander, but the wide distance placed between us whould not
Sanction my consulting you in many instances that I wished. however
I trust the day is not far distant before I shall have the pleasure
of being again ordered under your command. My first to you
bearing date (space] was through the hands of my Brother of Phil?
with the request of his writing you, which I have no doubt has been
put in. execution provided they came safe to hand. Should I be so
fortunate as to have any letters I beg you will forward them the first
conveyance, as I feel very uneasy on accoun: of not having receiq a
letter from my distant friends Since our captivity Captain Bainbridge
writes Commodores Barron and Preble by this opportunity and was
it not for that I am confident you whould hear from him I informed
him of my intention of writeing you, he desires his best respects to
you. we have most of us been afflicted with the fall fever which prevails
in this horrid climate [LC. JRP, Ac. 3647.1

most completely fitted, and is as fine a Ship as swims on the Sea. You
will be tempted to take command of her, not withstanding your partiality for your excellent Ship, the Congress. I feel a strong predeliction for the Cowtitutwn. I think, besides being good, she will be a

SIR The American Vice Consuls of Porto & Figueira have written
to me relative to the inconvenience & hazard to which Vessels were
subjected in performing quarantine without those Rivers. In fact,
at this inclement season of the ear it is absolutely impossible, as
Vessels have not the smallest she ter from a tempestuous ocean; and
it is no doubt within Your Lordships recollection, that an American
Vessel, but a short time ago, after laying five days off Porto Bar,
without being permitted to enter the River, was forced to put away
for this Port, with, I beleive, the loss of an anchor & that a Schooner
which was not allowed to enter the Mondego has arrived here within
two or three days, with the loss of a Cable & Anchor. This inconvenience I think can be remedied with the greatest safety to the Health
of His Royal Highness the Prince Regents Subjects, a t the same time
that the most perfect safety is secured to t.he Vessels by permitting
them to perform quarantine at the nearest safe anchorage within the
mouth of the Lower River, under the inspection of the Health Officers.
Upon the opposite side of the Mondigo from Figueira, about two miles
& a half from the mouth & two miles from where Vessels usually lay,
a place where there are no houses near the shore appears to be well
adapted to the purpose; both as to the health of the inhabitants & to
the safety of the Vessels Your Lordship must be too sensible of the inconvenience to which
the inhabitants of those two provinces will be subjected, by being
deprived of the foreign supplies of the first necessary of life, not to
make such arrangements as will secure to Vessels a direct entry into
the Rivers to perform quarantine, if it shall appear that no danger
attends the measure. I have taken the liberty to commit my ideas to paper agreeable to

Captain Chauncey in a few days, having been superceded by Commodore Barron. I sincerely regret that it has not been in my power to
liberate yourself, Officers & Crew while in command; be assured no
exertion on my part has been wanting which our Government, and
the forces under my command would justify - The forces which we
now have in these S e a , will undoubtedly free you from your present
situation 'ere long. I have r e d a number of letters from America
for yourself and Officers which I have delivered to Commodore
Barron; he will undoubtedly forward them when prudence sanctions
the measure.
I shall leave a copy of accounts relative to supplies &c"orwarded to
Tripoli, with Mr Higgens our Agent at this place; and shall write you
often from America - I presume that most of my letters heretofore
written, have never reached you, as they remain unanswered.
May God bless and preserve yourself and Officers, and soon restore
you to all your friends; is the ardent wish of one who feels sensibly
your misfortunes
P. S. Our Government has approbated my conduct while commanding in these seas; and I have been bond with a letter of thanks The present Squadron could not be fitted out without superceding me
as we had not a sufficient number of Captains in America Junior to

26tbOctober 1804. SIR I have the honour to enclose with this triplicate of NQ 85
Lisbon is the only Channel left me now to forward m Communications in. - I have satisfaction in saying I have receiv a Letter from
Consul Gavino dated the 14P, to that time he had not been ill, but
he advises "the Fever continued to rage with unremitted fury" The Emperours Agents sailed from this Bay the 1559 Inst for
Lisbon, takeing with them One hundred and forty four thousand
dollars. - A part of this sum is no doubt destined for purchase of
Amunition and Cloathing for Troops, but the chief object in view is
undoubtedly the obtaining small armed Vessels suitable for Cruizing
in the Straits. The Chief Agent in the busyness is an intelligent Moor who has
resided nearly thirty years in different parts of Europe and who had
long resisted every endeavour of the Emperour to enduce him to
return to this Country - he however came back some Months ago
and is generaly believed to be the person who laid the plan of this
Armament and its objects, before Muley Soliman. Alcayde Hashash has intimated to me the Emperours desire to send
the Meshowla to Tripoly. - I have answered him that is impossible
whilst War continues between the United States and that Regency,
reminding him a t same time, that i t was on Muley Solimans engagement this Ship should remain in his Ports until Peace, that she was
restored; to this I have not received any reply. - The Idea is so
repugnant to every sentiment of honour and of Justice, it can scarce
be supposed the Emperour or any of his Officers could expect i t would
meet a favourable reception. - I very much fear it was agitated with
another view, that of seeking a cause of complaint and argument for
resenting the disapointment in that particular and in sending the
Wheat to Tripoly. - I t is beyond a doubt Muley Solimans desire to
give assistance to Tripoly, I have viewed his conduct for some time as
actuated by that principle and I cannot but recommend to Government to meet this new Armament with a Naval force of a nature and
extent equal to the protection of the American Commerce in and about
the Straits at a very early period in the Spring. This Country d l never openly declare War, their system has
always been to Capture first and treat with the full hand, - nothing
will avert such a blow I much fear at the time I have mentioned, but
a force equal to prevent it and to impress a sense of an immediate
severe revenge for such an Act, being the consequence of it. Peace with Tripoly on the basis of the former Treaty most likely would
keep matters quiet here. - I sincerely wish that may happily be
brought about. - I have not heard from Commodore Barron or
his Squadron since he left Gibraltar. The E88ex arrived here from Lisbon on the 17thInstant and put to
Sea again some Evening. - A Tunisien Ambassador is now with

Mule SoIiman, it is mid he comes to sollicit a supply of Wheat. The gatavian Consul has quieted the Emperour for the present by
making a considerable addition in money to the Present he gave at
Mequinez and promising an Embassy so soon as the Political concerns
of the Republic will admit of it. - The circumstance of their having
no Commerce to interupt, induced Alcayde Hashash to become an
Advocate for this temporary arrangement -.

A great scarcity of grain. Our crew had no bread for three days.
The Bashaw ave orders to d the market people, not to sell grain to
any body b u t L household. There was no bread to be had for money.
A dispute took place between the Bashaw and the renagado Lysle,
about the purchasing of some barley. Lysle was considerably intoxicated, and insisted on his right to purchase grain in the market. The
Bashaw was highly affronted, and flew at him with all his might,
struck him, and ordered his mamelukes to disarm hi and put him
in prison, which they strove to obey, and carried him off. The
Bashaw, however, soon ordered him released, and then ordered his
servant, who was su posed to be the cause of the quarrel, bastinadoed
with five hundred b ows, which was immediately put into execution.

SIR I have the Honor to acquaint you that I have this moment
arrived direct from the Coast of Tripoli; which place I remained
before, in the Execution of your orders to me of the 234 UltQuntil
the 24th Inst being joind again by the Cmtellatwn, I left it on the
succeding Day & Cap$Campbell in charge of the Execution of your
orders, relative to the Blockade of that place I should not have returned into port quite so soon, had I not
conceived the Force left on the Coast (Constellation & Nautilus) fully
adequate, a t present, to the completion pf your Views, and this as
the most favourable opportunity of repa small defect in the
Rudder of this Ship & filling up her water; not having more than for
three weeks, of that article on board. In compliance with your orders, during the time I remained before
Tripoli the Blockade was kept up as close as the weather (which was
generally good) & other circumstances would admit; and not a Vessel
of m y description during the time, got Either out or in, except on
the 5tQs$, four small coasting Boats loaded with Wheat, which
they effected in consequence of light Winds & hazy Weather: Two
of these Boats I chased on shore - one about three & the other five
Miles to the Westward of the Town, & sent three Boats in to bring
one of them off, Anchoring a t the same time, within the reach of
Grape of the Shore, concieving I should to be able to cover the Boats,
so effectually, as to enable them to execute my orders without much
opposition, but being so near the Town & in sight of an Arrabian
Camp, before they could reach the shore, the Enemy had collected
in such such Numbers, as to make the t h ' i Impracticable without the
greatest probability of making sacrifices, or at least hazarding more
than the Emergency of such an acquisition would Justify. - -4s
the Enemy were coverd by Rocks in a manner to prevent my annoying
them much by the Fire from the Ship. - To the Officers (Lieut"
Wyer, Henly & Blakelp commanded the Boats) and Men engaged in
this semice, it is but Justice in me to observe that they would have
Effected tbe Execution of my Orders, I have not the least doubt, in
spite of all opposition, had I not been induced through motives of
regard of the consequence of hazarding the lives of so many brave
Men, to effect an object of so little Importance to their Country, by
Countermanding my Orders (by Signal) after they had reach'd the
Enemy within Pistol Shot. Conceiving it an object of no small Importance, to know with
certainty to what distance our Ships can approach the Batterys of
Tripoli with safety, I had resolved for some time past on sounding,
the first favourable opportunity, for this purpose; .&r, on Friday night
19" Inst, I made the attempt & succeeded, ('wzthout Interception)
much to my satisfaction, - It being between one & two o'clock in
the morning, when I went in & every thing quiet, I was enabled to
approach so near as to observe the position of the Cruizers & found
that all the Gun Boats were haul'd up with their Sterns Foremast
on the Beach, so as to Enable them to act as a Battery & the Ketch
Schooner, Brig & two Galleys, dismantled & moored to the Wdls The Brig has no masts in - I am now sufficiently acquainted with

should rather suppose that she is a Tripolime, and that her Papers
have been thrown overboard: At any rate be this as it may, the
circumstances under which I found her, are, I concieve, a sdEcient
Justification on my part, for sending her in for Examination. [LC. JRP, Letters & Orders, Book A, 1804-1805.1

TANGIER
SOt@October 180.4.
SIR The 3e of this Month I wrote you by way of Leghorn to accom-

pany triplicate of my respects of the 15" SeptrOn the 28th UltQone of the Emperours Frigates returned to Salle
with a Prussian Shi and Brig, captured off the Coast of Portugal.
The Crews have een set to work on the Fortifications of Rhabat
and Vessels and Cargoes adjudged Prizes. - The other two Frigates
went into the Tagus where Captain Barron left them on the 13th
Ins' - The Frigate came to S d e has r e t m e d to Lisbon with two
Captains to supercede the former Commanders of those Ships, whom
the Emperour has determined to punish for having gone into that
f o r t before the expiration of the term they were directed to Cruize. The funds destined by Muley Soliman for augmenting his Navy went
from hence on a Ragusian Polacre the 15th Inst ascertained to be one
hundred forty four thousand dollars. The purchase of Ordnance Stores - Cloathing for the Army and
necessarys for the Emperours Family no doubt constitute part of the
duties of the Agents on this occasion, but the chief object in view is
obtaining Armed Vessels suitable for C r u i z i i in and about the Straits;
this I give you from what I consider good authority. I am also equdy founded in saying Muley Soliman continues highly
disposed to yield every assistance in his power to Tripoly and that his
Shagrin at not having been able to do so before, is no way abated.
Alca de Hashash has intimated to me his Majestys desire of sendin
the &fe;eahardo to Tripoly, I answered that it was impossible unt8
Peace should take place, and reminded him that the Ship was restored
on the E m erours engagement that she should remain in his Ports
I have not received any rep1 to that Letter. - If
during the
Peace be happily concluded with Tripoly on t e footing of the former
Treaty, most probably we s h d not have any Novelty here, but if the
War continues I make no hesitation in saying, that it is now my
decided oppinion this Country will take part in it w l y in the Spring,
and that it is this intention has chiefly instigated the resolution of
encreasing their Navy. I have acquainted the Secretaq of State of tbis and recommended
an adequate Naval force being stationed near this by the time I have
mentioned, either to prevent the dreaded evil, or resent with energy
aueh Act of Hostility as may be committed. The Capture of these Prussian Vessels sailing from Lisbon, will
probably enduce the Minister of that Nation to endeavour at preventing the Moors purchasing Armed Vessels in Portugal, - but in
England they will not meet such impediments. I have not failed to repeat to Mr Jsrvis my request of his keeping
you advised what may be done in these mattars under his observation,
which f trust he will do. -

[Attention is invited to the journal of Captain John Rodgera which indicates
that he continued to command the U. S. Frigate Congress until 9 November, and
that on 10 November he left the Congress to command the U. S. Frigate Constitution. From 2 November, the Congress with some other U. 6. Ships of War
cruised off and on the town of Syracuse awaiting pratique, the quarantine regulations bein particularly rigid because smallpox had broken out in a t least one of
the U. 8. 8hips. Thia is offered aa a possible explanation of the delay in Captain
Rodgers' actually entering on board to take command of the Constitution.
Attention is invited also to the illness which kept Commodore Barron on shore
and plaoed Captain Rodgera under the necessity of frequently acting for the Commodore, until the U. S. Squadron was turned over to Captain Rodgers in May

Excellency, that he is now in Egypt waiting for the Promised Assistance of the United States of America, and that he has a great number
of Troops Engaged for the Purpose of Cooperating with the U. S. and
that he will repay all money advanced on his Account and give up all
Vessels and their Cargos which may be taken in Tripoli Bengazi and
Derna, as Prizes to the U. S. Shi s of War, and he will always remain
at Peace and Friendship me the
S. of America,
Ten Thousand Dollars will Enable him to take Derna and Bengazi,
and I am convinced the Prizes taken there will amount to more than
that sum, and this is the proper time to assist him as the Arabs is now
much displeased with his Brother the Bashaw of Tripoli, and Provisions is now ve scarce and the Winter season is the best time for the
Troops to
from Egypt, therefore hope your Excellency will not
loose this favourable oppertunity, which will have such an Effect on
all the Barbary Powers as will prevent them from going to War with
the United States of America.

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1804 TO 1805

To Secretary of State from Tobias Leu, U. 6. Conaul General, Algiers
MALTA
November J@1804
NP 9.
SIR,Since m last, under date of July 16t@ (Duplicate of which and
enclosures are erewith transmitted) I have been honored with your
letters of the 6t'3 & 13Q of June, which were handed to me a t Algiers,
by Cap* Chauncy, on the 29'8 of July
The letter from the President to the Dey of Algiers appetwed to
give him much satisfaction, particular4 that part which related to the
Cannon.The Danes and Spaniards ave not yet madea settlement
for the Cannon broF by them; but they expect (at least the former; for
the latter will get nothing) to receive half a dollar per pound Algerine
wt which is about 25 cent more than our's. It d o r d s me the lghest de ee of satisfaction to find that our
Government has taken up our airs in this sea in the manner i t has
done. I trust our national character will be now established on a
respectable footing, and that we shall be no longer subjected to the
ca rices of the Barbary Powers.
$he several points touched upon in your letter of the 6" of June
shall be particularly attended to, and I feel very happy that noth'
has been done by way of settlement with Tunis before the
of Commodore Barron; as I have no doubt we shall now settle everything with that power in o l r own way.
I forwarded to Mr Dams an extract from your letter relating to
Tunis; in order that he might take no steps which could involve the
U. States in an engagement to pay an annuity to that power. - I
have not heard from him since; but Commodore Preble has a letter
from him late in September, in which he says, the Bey seems perfectly
quiet, and has made no demands since he has been assured of our
Force in this Sea.
On the 13th of September, the U. States Frigate Congress Capte
Rodgers, arrived in Algiers Bay from Gibraltar & the coast of
Morocco. - Finding that Commodore Barron has passed up to
Tripoli some days since, without being able to touch there [or here],
on account of the strong N. 333 winds, I determined to take my passage
up in the Congress, that f might be upon the spot in case a negotiation
should take place on the arrivd of our Squadron. - I accordingly
made application to the Dey, (to whom I had before given intormation
that I was ordered to be ready to proceed to Tripoli, whenever the
Bashaw shg be disposed to treat on proper terms) for perrnisssion to
leave his Regency for a short time for that purpose, which he not only
most readily consented to; but added the strongest assurances that
every t h i i sh@be well on our affairs during my absence, as he shg take
all on his own head, and expressed the most pointed disapprobation
of the conduct of the Bashaw of Tripoli in his war with us; giving me
a letter for him in the Turkish language, which he says orders him to

of everything which transpires du
my absence, and will also
attend to the delivery of the Cargo of t e Annuity Ship, if one should
arrive before I return.
On Sunday the 234 of September we arrived off Tripoli, where we
found the U. S. Frigate President, Commodore B m n , and the Constellation, Cap@ Campbell; and there first learnt the several attacks
which had been made on that place by Commodore Preble, previous
to the arrival of Commodore Barron. - The account of these
actions will be so fully detailed by ComdQPreble's dispatches that
I shall only say, that altho' they were not successful to the extent
we could wish; yet such acts of intrepidity, and heroism were performed b that small force, as must have excited the terror as well
as astonisLent of the Tripolines, and given them an awful impression
of our national character, Much, very much do I regret that we
lose the services of that brave and judicious Commander, and I am
sure it is no less regretted by Commodore Barron. - As Commodore
B m o n was about to proceed to Syracuse & Malta, to water his Ship
&q I embarked on board him, and arrived a t the former place on the
26Q where I remained till the 6tQof October, and then proceeded in
the President for this place, where we arrived on the Q
7tW
-e
found
here the Constitution, and the B ' Syren & Vixen. The Argus &
Enterprise went from S acruse to%essina with the Neapolitan Gun
boats, and the Nazld us went off Tripoli. On the arrival of the
Nautvlus off Tripoli the ConsteUation came to Syracuse to water,
and from thence to this place, from whence she sailed on the 17Q
ultimo for Tripoli, to releive the Congress, which came here to water
on the 2BtQ - On the 29'Q arrived the Essez from the coast of
Morocco, where everything was said to be quiet: As this ship was
put in quarantine here, it became necessary for all the Ships to proceed to Syracuse to make the exchange of ships, Captn Rodgers takes
the Constitution, Cap5 James Barron [Decatur] the Congress, and
Captain Decatur [J. Barron] the Essez. - They left this on the
instant. - After the exchange shall be made, Commodore Barron
off Tripoli with all his force, and leavinu there one or
@,"",?t%$%ips
and smaller Vessels; to proceed himsegf with the rest
to Tunis, and along the coast. - As we appear to have every thing
quiet at Tunis, I shall, agreeably to your instructions, avoid going
to that place at present. has been heard directly from Tripoli since the last attack
made by ommodore Preble, so that we are ignorant of the impression
it made on the mind of the Bashaw with respect to our &airs; but
we know that the first and second attacks lessned his pretention very
much; and I presume that as our reinforcement did not appear so
soon as was expected, the Bashaw did not beleive we shg receive any;
and when they did arrive the season for active operations having
passed, he will not be disposed to come forward to treat on proper
rounds until next spring, knowing that he will be secure this winter
From any formidable attack on his City.
I t seems to be the decided opinion of all those who have had experience in these affairs, that our Force will readily bring the Bashaw to
terms of eace without any pretensions for payment therefor, or any
idea of trigute; but it is also beleived that he will sufferevery extremity
before he will deliver up the Captives without some ransome, as the
example would be unprecedented, and even if he should be disposed

-%

to do it himself, he would not be permitted by his people. This,
however, must be tried.
As I am now here, in the neighbourhood of Tripoli, Commodore
Barron is decidedly of opinion with myself, that I shg remain here
until the operations can take effect in the Spring, as it is presumed
the business will then be very short; and it is possible also that the
Bashaw hearing of the formidable preparations against him may be
induced to come forward this winter with admissable offers of negociation. I feel the less hesitation in remaining, as our affairs with
Algiers stand well, and the Dey can have no pretensions for breaking
with us on the score of deficiencies. - In the spring I shall accompany
Commodore Barron off Tripoli in order to be ready to treat with the
Bashaw, if he shg desire it; before we make an attack. I presume the co-operation of the Brother of the Bashaw of Tripoli
will not be attempted. Our force is thought sufficient to compel him
to terms without this aid, and in any event it is very doubtful whether
he has it in his power, with any reasonable pecuniary assistance we
might give, to render us service. He is now in Egypt, driven by his
brother from Darne, where it is presumed he might have made a stand,
had he been a man of any force or influence; which, from the best
accounts I can collect, he is not. Indeed I sh? place much more
confidence in the contmuancle of a peace with the present Bashaw, if
he is well beaten into it, then I shG have with the other, if he should
be placed on the throne by our means.
I have received from Commodore Barron the Attayan which you
mentioned was deposited with him for me; and I have bro? with me
the Articles I had on hand in Algiers for presents &o if they shq be
wanting. I am very so to inform you that Commodore Barron's hedth
has been very ba for some time past, and I fear that his recovery will
be but slow.
The rendevouze of our Ships will be mostly at Syracuse for altho
Sir Alexander Ball, the Governor, and all the other Officers are ready
to render us any service if it sh* be required; yet the quarantine to
be performed by Vessels from Barbary is very rigid here, and there
being continually some dispute respecting deserters, or men who leave
our Ships and go on board the British declaring themselves to be
British subjects make it a less elegible place for our Ships than Syracuse, where the Americans are in fact commanders of the Town.
I cannot close this letter without expressing the sensibility I feel
for the repeated proofs of confidence which the President has been
pleased to shew me, and assurance that nothing in my power shall
be left undone tfi evince my desire to be useful, and worthy of them.

U. S. Ship John Adams
New York $6" February 1806
SIR, I had the Honor of writ'
ou from Syracuse on the 1 6 q of
"pILave been immediately under the
September last, since which time
Orders of Commodore Preble, who I presume has kept you informed
of our Movements since that Period.
We left Syracuse on the gt+ of October for Malta and arrived the
Day following where we discharged the remainder of the Stores: Ballasted the Shlp and waited untill the 4 t+ of November for Commodore
Preble, on which Da I sailed, with him, and Mr Randolph on board
for Syracuse, where arrived the next Day. - sail'd on the 15th for
Messina, arrived on the 18 t@-sail'd the 2 1" for Palermo. arrived on
the 2gt@- sailed for Naples the 1's of December - arrived on the 6t'?
in the Evening, it then blowing hard from the Southward anchored
with both Bowers in 12 Fathoms Water, and veered 60 Fathoms on the
Larboard and 30 on the Starboard and brought up, struck lower Yards
and top Gt Mast
At 10 P. M. parted the Starboard Bower, let go the Sheet Anchor,
and veered on both Cables untill the Ship's Stem was in the Breakers
and then brought up, struck Top Mast, and got top Gallant Masts on
Deck - from this Time untill Daylight we lay with extreme Anxiety,
expecting every Moment to part and go onshore - At 6 A. M. sent a
Boat on board of H. B. M. Ship Renown which lay near us for Assistance which was handsomely granted, by sending his own Boat with
Cables and an Anchor which they dropped three Cables Length to
Windward of us and gave the End of the Cable on board. We also
very soon got Assistance from the Naval Arsenal, which also sent off a
new 19 In. Cable, bent to a heavy Anchor which they let go three
Cables' Lengths to Windward and gave us the End of a 10 Inch Cable
which was bent to the large One, the Wind moderating, we before
Ni ht hove off into a safe Situation and moored with the Anchors and
Ca les sent us. On heaving up our two Anchors that we were riding
by (the Sheet and Bower) we to our utter Astonishment found them
both broke off in the Shank. The Anchors are American Manufactory
and the worst I ever saw; what prevented the Ship's going on shore
God only knows. We the Next Morning k h e d for, and got the Starboard Bower Anchor which we parted from the evening of the 6 @ .
Commodore Preble tryed every Means to urchase an Anchor for
the Ship, but could only procure one of a out eighteen hundred
Weight, and was obliged to take Cable with it as they would not part
with one without taking both - the Cable is a New one of 14 Inches
but not fit for us. The Commodore procured the Loan of an Anchor
from the Neapolitan Government, which is to be returned to Messina
or Palermo with those two Anchors and the one we got at Malta we
were obliged to sail with; and are all the Anchors that we have got ah
this Time, we were obliged to take the 19 Inch Cable from the Neapolitan Government after riding by it. We sailed from Naples for
Gibraiter on the 23P Decr and arrived on the St+ of January; watered
and provisioned the Ship and sailed on the
for the United States.
On the gth sent our Boat on shore a t Tangier for Mr Simpson's Dispatches and in the Evening took our Departure from Cape Spartell.

P. M. were nearly in the wave of Messina. At 2 o'clock a signal was
made to a schooner standing in, which was answered and found to be

Doctor: - "Well, this scuttle is not to come up." At this instant,
the purser Mr. Hunt came below, and hearing the debate, aaked what
was the matter. The venerable Doctor replied he had Capt. Smith's
orders not to have his apartment disturbed by the aforesaid scuttles.
Mr. Hunt told him that the spirit room was under his charge, and
that a passage to it was not to be stopped by his orders, and then

Novemr 6* 1804
DEARSIR I am sensible of the pleasure you have Experienced
in having had it in your power to communicate to Congress, this
session, the reduction of Tripoli, to Terms honorable &: advantageous
to our Country; and I greatly regret that circumstances have so
conduced as to render such an Event impracticable this Season the
squadron not haring arrived so soon as you perhaps contemplated:
However I think I can almost with certainty say to you that next
Summer will complete the Business in a manner highly honorable
to the American Arms; as a General Enthusiam appears to pervade
among all ranks, and nothing that the Bashaw can do, will, I concieve,
prevent his destruction in t.he most complete manner, without he
offers Terms the most humiliating to himself. - If the opposition
we meet with should be Formidable, so much the better, for I feel such
l be made, as to induce nie to
confidence in the Exertions that d
believe, that if we are Formidably opposed, our little Xavy will
Establish a name deserving of a place among'st the most Magnanimous; and such as no Trifle can again ever injure - I have this
day, by order of Commodore Barron, changed my pendant into the
Cmtiihiion, vhich altho a larger ship I do not think so fine a one
(for her rate) as the Congress, which has every good quality to recommend her, and her crew far (now) from belng ordinary - The
Constitution is upwards of 70 men short of her Compliment, which
I will make up in t,he best manner I can before her services are
seriously wanted - 1 have but a few days since return'd from the
Coast of Tripoli, but have no news worth communicating, farther
than that the Bashaw is building [ms mutilated] Battery's, which
I conceive can only serve to make his ruin more Complete & add
to the Laurels we shall achieve, provided we do our duty; the lesson
he will get, will I think ever prevent him or his successor's from again
War upon the U7States & compleatly put a Stop to the
Bey
m&'? o Tunis's Demands - Commodore Barron has been in bad
health for some time; hi complaint - an affection of the Liver. I feel much concern'd for the loss of poor young Israel; whose
intrepidity and other amiable qualifications, had he lived, would
have made him an honor to his friends &- an Ornament to the Service. - The package you sent out by me for him I have sent back

Our Situation a t present My D' Sir is beyond conception, nearly
Six Months Solitary imprisonment have elapsed since the doors of
our prison have been opened for any other purpose than supplying
us with our daily sustenance, it's true have been treated with more
lenity than we had reason to expect from a Barbary Prince but how
much better whould it have been for us to have been put to hard
labour, as our crew then we could feel the fresh air, which is so essential to human nature I am sorry to find in the establishment of our little Navy our loss
has been so great, in the death of so many brave young Officers, it's
now I hope firm,if we may Judge from the manner i t has been augmented by promotions and appointments. the Emulation amongst
the Officers must have been very great during last Summer, but I
have no doubt Comdr"arron,
will shortly give them all an opportunity of distinguishii themselves.
I fear My Dr Sir, by my communications not being reciprocal on
your part, they do not meet your approbation, you must be confident

Command, or deem me an ungrateful being, was not my attatchment

The confmernent makes it impossible for Captin Bainbridge to

himself in the necessity to write with Lime Juice or with a weak

only appears when heated over the fire.
It is not necessary to request of You Sir, to keep this a profound

would be very diiagreable for poor Captain Bainbridge and his fellow

SIR,

It appears by communications from Commodore Preble, that the
Government of Naples, has in the most friendly manner, lent him a
number of Gun and bomb boats, with the proper apparatus, for
assisting his operations at Tripoli. As a common enemy to Tripoli,
his Sicilian Majest may be considered as having an interest in the
measures projecte8 against the Bashaw; and so far the facilities
yielded by him ma be the less meritorious. But they have notwithstanding a fair tit e to the acknowledgements of this Government
and the title is the stronger as being h e l f in a state of perpetual
war with the Barbary powers he may be considered as having an
interest in prolonging that of the United States rather than in hastening its termination. In making these acknowledgements the Presi-

9

132

NAVAL OPEIZATIONS FROM 1804 TO 1805

dent has chosen as the most convenient channel, the American and
Neapolitan Legations at Paris. You will therefore take an early
occasion of communicating to the Ambassador from Naples, the sensibility of the President to the kind and valuable aid which has been
supplied, and the satisfaction with which opportunities will be seized
for
. . demonstrating i t by correspondent returns of civility and friendship.
I t has a t different times and from different quarters been suggested
that the regulations of Commerce and Quarantine at Naples were
very unequal and unfavorable to Nations not in Treaty with that
power, and not less so to the United States than an of them. The
papers inclosed which are copied from those received rom Commodore
Preble on this subject will explain the several cases in which the
inconveniences are felt. There are two modes by which provision
may be made for them; one by Treaty; against this there is the general
objection ofmultiplying connections in that form with foreign powers,
where the object is otherwise attainable. The other, by a reciprocit
of voluntary re ations, founded in a friendly understanding whic
has the same e ect, without the embarrassments incident to positive
Stipulations. The President wishes, and authorizes you to enter
into this subject with the Neapolitan Minister'at Paris, and to propose
thro' him such a tacit arrangement between the two Countries, as
will place their citizens and subjects respectively on the footing of
the most favored nations. With us the subjects of Naples are placed
on this footing. The arrangement will have its reciprocal effect
therefore, as soon as the Neapolitan Government shall put the
Citizens of the United States on the like footing on the most favored
Nations. From the dispositions which have been expressed on several occasions on the part of that Government, there is g[r]ound to
expect that this will be done, and that the liberal example set by the
United States will be rather a motive to it, than to a continuance
of an inequality of priveleges, in the calcuIation that i t will not be
countervailed by the United States.
The passage in the President's Message of which a copy is inclosed
relating to the private armaments from our ports, will enable you to
confirm to the French Government, the explanations heretofore
given of the sentiments of the Executive on that subject; and will
probably favor the object of obtaining an arrangement sanctioning
an innocent commerce with St Domingo. This object continues to
be of great importance both as it respects the harmony of the two
nations and the interests and. wishes of the American Merchants,
and consequently claims a contmuance of the effo~tsfor accomplishing
it. The argument with France for concurring m our views, drawn
from the tendency of prohibitions against us, to throw the negroes
into the arms of her enem , derives force from recent information
from a respectable source, t at British overatures hare been actually
made with a view to monopolize the trade-of the Island. An extract
of the letter containing the information is mclosed.
Inclosed also is an extract of a letter lately written to Mr Monroe,
and copies of the correspondence annexed thereto, which has lately
passed between this Department and the Marquis Yrujo. I t is
thought proper that you should be acquainted with the whole, the
better to cultivate in the French Government the impressions and

f

E

dispositions so important to the negotiations with Spain committed
to Mr Monroe.
The interest which France has in removing all dangers of a rupture
between the United States and Spain, is too obvious not to be felt by
her; and deserves the most skillful vigilance and management in
turning it to the advantage of the United States.
November 27 The Ambassador of the Emperor of Germany at
Paris havin written to Mr Livingston respecting the capture of the
Imperial Po acre Padina by one of the vessels of our Mediterranean
Squadron, and as the subject may be revived notwithstanding the
satisfactory answer the latter gentleman gave it, I have thought it
might be useful to furnish you with the inclosed copy of my letter to
Mr Pinckney, written in consequence of the complaint having been
before presented at Madrid.
General Turreau arrived here on Monday last.and immediately
announced himself, postponing however, his Official visit until the
arrival of M: Pichon, who was then at Philad* and until his baggage
would be received. It is probable these causes of delay will be removed in a day or two.
The inclosed copy of my answer to M' Pichons letter by which he
communicated the Semtm Consulturn ordaining the new form of the
French Government is a necessary appendage to the instructions
respecting the address of your letters of credence.

TRIPOLIBARBARY
11%NOC.1804 (COPY)
Dr SIR. By the last arrival from Malta which brot us a few
letters I learn that you are in that place, I sincerely hope that you
have left Algiers on the business of negotiating with t h s Regency
for our liberation. This presumption has given much pleasure to
myself & fellow officers, for we have the fullest confidence in your

136

KAt7AL OPEEATIONS FROM 1804 T O 1805

conducting the affair with dignity to our Country, and just interest
to our situation in the proper channel of this Government. I sincerely hope, that the instructions from our Government gives sufficient
latitude to effect a peace on the best terms that can be got. By
the American papers, sent to us by Com. Barron, I was very much
astonished to find in them a letter from Corn. Preble dated 7* Jan?
last informing our Govt t,hat he had had indirect communication
from the Bashaw of Tripoli offering to ransom the American Citizens
prisoners to him for 500 dollars each & a second letter of the 20tb of
same month mentions that he had recc further proposals from t,he
Bashaw offerhg to exchange Americans for Tripolitan prisoners to
the Commodore. and the ComGin said letter supposes that for the
remainder American Citizens the Bashaw d l take 400 dollars each
and make peace without an Anual Stipend. Believe me D: Sir,
that the Bashaw never authorized any such offers to be made & I
think the Commodore was premature in communicating it to our
Gov? as indirect information from the Bashaw for I cannot believe
his authority was sufliciently respectible to have sanctioned a belief
that such terms were officially authorised to be made, and I wish
that Com. P. had not been so much in haste in making his communication to Govg especially as he had wrote on the 4gh of the same
month to the Minister of fofl affairs on the subject of exchange and
ransom and the Vessel which Convey'd his letter to Tripoli had not
returned when he wrote the foregoing letters to our Gort
The Bashaw's demand I verily believe at that time would have
been more than 4 times the sum mentioned by the Commodore;
and as for an Exchange, I am Certain, that be never had the most
distant Idea of of making any, I have heard that he declared he
wld not give an orange a Plece for his Subjects, prisoners to the
Americans. The Minister, of Foreign affairs, has told me several
times, that the Bashaw would not give, one of the American Srtilors,
for all the prisoners the Corn. has. I respect Com. P. much, and
believe he has done, what wtts possible to effect with his force, but
can't help regretting the Communications he made to Govt as it
will no doubt, cause them to expect peace, on lower terms than I
believe it possible, to obtain, and may have induced them to restrict
the powers invested in a Negotiation within too narrow limits.
Whenever a Negotiation is attempted, I hope it will be by a person,
coming on Shore to negociate who will be able to have communicacation with Sidi Mahumed Dghies, Minister of Foreign Affairs and
before the person who comes to attempt to Iand; he Should obtain
permission from this Regency, I believe he might come with safety
if he obtained it.
The Bashaw and his Public Officers, like some Ceremony & were
not pleased with the manner that Mg OBrien landed. I learn by let.ters which some of the officers have received that it is the intention
of the Presidt of the U. S. to put the Bashaw of Tripoli's eldest brother
in chief command of this Regency; should this be the case, which I cannot believe, and sincerely hope that such an Impolic 8: extraordinary
measure has not intruded itself on the wisdom, of our Gov! and if our
liberation is to depend on the success of that measure, I am decidedly
of an opinion that our Country had better abandon us to our unfortunate fate & save treasures which will uselessly [be] spent. The
thing is impmeticable except an A m y was sent from the U. S. fio
take the Town, then they might place any person they pleased 11

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS

137

Command of the Town; and in that event I should suppose a Christian
would be prefered to a Mahometan. Whoever has advised such a
measure must be entirely ignorant of the power of the present ruler
and of the disposition of his Subjects who always detest the miserable
exile and is it not a natural supposition that should he have any
friends in this Regency that they will abandon the moment that they
find he is joined with Christians against Mussulmen. No people on
Earth I believe are more biggoted in their religion than Mahometans.
- History shews us a most unparallel'd enthusiasm among them
I can't conceive the most distant hope of any utility to be derived to the
U S from pecuniary or other aid given the poor effeminate fugitive
Brother of the Bashaw of Tripoli, who had not spirit enough to
retain his situation when placed in it, or has had interest sufEicient
among his own religious sect. (Mussulmen) to re-establish himself
in what he conceices his right but has wandered an Exile far from
Country, Wife & Children for more than 8 years without distu[r]bing
the Regency of Tripoli. He was placed by his Brother in Command
at Derne the most favorable province for his Attempting a Counter
Revolution. The present Bashaw suspecting that he was not conducting himself properly, drove him from that situation, O d y by an
Order without sending troops against him. What can be expected
from such a pusillanimous being. - If peace can't be effected this
winter I am of an opinion that after our Squadron makes their exertions next spring & summer it will be to the honor & interest of the
U. S. to make peace on the best terms attainable; for a continuation
of the War. would be attended with considerable Expence without
reducing much the demand. I beg, My dear Col! that you will excuse my being so lengthy in
this letter and I trust that you will do me the Justice to believe that
the observations I have made are not in the least infiuenced by my
Unfortunate situation however desirable liberty may be. My
representations will be actuated by my Love of Country. [NA.

SIR,The Argus sails for Egypt tomorrow, with no alteration in her

Hamet Bashaw are better known -*
I t is understood between Commodore Barron and myself that I
am to accompany the Bashaw by land in the expedition against
Tripoli next summer. This I shall cheerfulIy do on condition that he
will give the inspection, field discipline, and disposition of attack and
defense of his army to me On further consideration I am of opinion that the supplies of arms
and amunition to be loaned him should come out from America, that
we may not be subject to the caprice of a foreigner who may influence
the king of the two Sicilies to withhold them. Brass field pieces, well
mounted, and excellent french arms are ready a t Springfield; and as
this place is in the vicinity of Hartford, the best port in the United
States, perhaps, for shipping salt beef, 14 brass 4 pt* and 500 or a
thousand stands of arms may be sent out from thence. Good musket
owder, flints and balls; and suitable amunition for the Artilery will
ge necessary Presuming on the perseverance of Government in the resolution,
you expressed to me last spring of furnishing those supplies I shall
assure the Bashsw accordingly If cash be loaned him, of which he
will stand in need, I desire it may be under regulations which will

Enterprize has gone to Trieste to repair, the Syren is on the Gibraltar
station & the Argus left here this morning for Alexandria it is supposed to bring down the Beys Brother; Mr. Eaton went in her - the
Commodore is too unwell to attend to the duty or Business of the
squadron & we have the Broad Pendant on board this Ship his
complaint is that of the liver, and it will soon be determined whether
he lives or not. I expect we shall sail from here in a week or so, to
procure men in the different ports on the North side, the Ship being
60 or 80 short of her eomplement, we mount 30-24 pounders on the
Gun Deck 14-12 pounders on the Quarter Deck & Forecastle & 8-32
pound Carronades on the Gunwales in all 52 you have ere this heard
of the different actions off Tripoli and can judge of them. the blowing
up of the ketch was an unfortunate &air*; you can form an Idea what
effect it must have had in the harbour - I will as near as possible
describe her to you I beleive she was a vessel of about 40 Tons
the same that Decatur boarded the Philadelphia in - rigged in this
hlsnnert . . . the Magazine for the Powder was built forward of
the foremast & contained 80 BBls of Gun Powder & 150 loaded Shells
placed in a position on the supposition of going in before the wind, to
be thrown in to the town; through each Bulk head there was a hole
made large enough to receive a Gun Barrel loaded with composition,
calculated and found to burn 11 minutes, from these Gun Barrels
to the scuttle forward & companion way aft there was a trough coptaing a train of Powder; so a Person had only to put his match down m
either place touch the train and jump into his boat, and 11 minutes
would certainly give him sufficient time to get o far enough from her,
but it is the general beleif that poor Sommer lew himself & Officers
up as he told as his intention before he left the Commodore, in case he
was boarded - but I sincerely hope we shall pay them next Summer

Alexander Ball to His B. M. agents a t Alexandria and Grand
Cairo, which will be undoubtedly serviceable - It was my intention
to have taken along with us Hamet Bashaw's Consul; but, on a close
ins ection, I don't like him: there is too much wood about his head
a n 8 beef about his ancles either to advance or retreat handsomely M: Farquhar goes forward with us If, on falling in with the friendly Bashaw, it is found that he can
raise a sufficient force, where he is, to march to the rear of Bengazi,
I shall accompany him: provided there should a pear a rational possisibility of cutting off the retreat of the Bey o that province which
he would be apt to secure by our attacking him in front by regular
advances - He would be an acquisition.to us, because one of his
wives is sisterand, it is said a favorite sister, of the ruling Bashaw
of Tripoli - Should we succeed in this qxpedition, or by a coup
de mazn, to et possession of that post, i t 1s hoped succour will be
sent forwar seasonably to secure its advantages Be assured, Sir, it was not owing to want of consideration nor
attention that I did not visit you a t your country situation and take

informs me that all is well in that Quarter. At the same time I r e d
letters of the 24@ ultimo from Algiers, where every thing remains
quiet with respect to us. On the 14 of October the Dey sent out 3
Frigates, a brig & 6 Xebecks to Cruise for the Neapolitans who had
been on the Coast of Tunis, and with Orders to send in all Vessels
loaded with grain, as they were in great want of that article, and would
pay a Good price for it.On the 20tQof October he recd acc" from
Constantine that the Marabout, or Holy Man, who has lately made
an insurrection in that quarter, had assembled his forces to the m o u n t
of nearly 100,000 men, well furnished with everything; and that the
City w@fall into his hands, unless immediate Succour was sent. He
dispatched the only Vessels (4) left in his port, with what troops they
could carry, and a new Bey for Constantine as he suspected the Old
one of being in concert with the Marabout. Shd this acc8 be true,
the District of Constantine will before this, be lop'd off from Algiers,
and I have no doubt become another nest of Pyrates. Mr Eaton informed me, on Saturday Even=about half an our before
the Argus sailed, when I was alongside of her, that He had discovered
a Barque, loaded with Ammunition, bound to Tripoli, but declared
for Jerba; I have made enquiries respecting her, and it appears she is
bound to Tunis, with a Cargo of Grain. She is about 80 tons, deeply
ladened, & her gunwale painted yellow. As she is bound for Tunis
we can have no right to question her here; but I presume Mr E. has
written to you on the Subject, as he was verg sanguine.
We have heared nothing from the U States since you left us. The
account of the Sickness at Gibraltar are more favorable than heretofore. I t is reported, with Confidence, that the Governor, Sir Thomas
Trigge, is dead. - This day the report of a War between G. B. and
Spain is more strong than ever; a circumstantial detail of an engagement between 4 English Frigates & 2 Sp Galeons, and the Capture of
the latter, has been rec*
The Patrone of the Sparanara who carries this is directed to wait

receipt of your acceptable favor of the 9'h inst with its enclosures

on y the PresicEent Bt Constellation. The other vessels having gone to
Malta & Syrwuse; and the Season being so far advanced as to make
it unsafe to have Gun boats on the Coast, the idea of a further immediate attack wm given up, and I came to this place with Commodore

active 0 eration may commence, or the Bashaw comes forward with
admissib e terms. - HePoillhaye no more advances under fhe sanction of a F1a.g of Truce. - I am sorry to inform you that Commodore

when I shdl write to you fully. - In the meantime I can only say
that we feel very easy as to the Bey of Tunis' threats or Conduct
towards us if it should be unfriendly. As the offer of a biennid payment in Cash was not accepted by him & finished, I do not conceive
that we are bound now to go even to that point
The Language to him will be decisive and a termination of our

every t b g to promote that, consistently must be done. - It is
not probable that I shall have the satisfaction of seeing you untill

an Opportunity shodd offer from Tunis, to inform h@Timothy Mountford whom I left a t that place that I have r e d his Letter of the 24@

TRIPOLI220 NOV~
1804.

Dr SIR, I have not heard from you since the lo* Sept. I hope

nothing but the want of opportunity has occasioned my not having
that pleasure.
On the 30q a Vessel arrived here from Malta, and brought me a
letter from Corn. B m o n , and a few others for the Officers from their
friends in America - Some of their letters mention, that it is the
intention of the President of the U. S. to reinstate the Bashaw's
elder brother in chief command of this Regency - I hope sincerely
that such an impolitic & extraordinary measure has not intruded
Itself on our Govf - The right of the present Baahaw is acknowledged by the Grand Signior, and all the Governments of Europe,
and I can't conceive that the least benefit could derive to the U. S.
from pecuniary or any other aid iven to the poor effeminate fugitive
brother of the Baahaw of ~ r i ~ owho

Country, wife & children, I believe near ten yeam without giving

the present ruler of Tripoli the least inquietude, and who had not
courage enou h to maintain his command when placed in it, and
who has not ad influence enough among his own religious sect to
reinstate him. He was placed in command of the Province of Derne
by the present Bashaw, who suspected him of some intrigue & ordered
him to quit that Province, which order he obeyed, altho' situated in
that part of the Regency most favorable to a Counter revolution
without a Soldier being sent against him. What can be expected
from such a pusillanimous being & He never was popular in this
Regency - If he should have any friends is it not natural to presume that they would immediately turn against h i on seeing him
leagued in with Christians, in a war against X.Iusselmen. To you
who are acquainted with the Mahometan character it is unnecessary
for me to say that no people on earth are greater enthusiasts in their
Religion, and would regard a Coalition as a religious war. Where is he to be found in Egypt, Mecca, Medini, Ispahan, Constantinople, may he not have by this time paid a visit ta the great
Prophet Mahomet.
By the W pa ers sent to us by Com. Bmron, I was sorry to see
Commodore Preb e's communication to Govt in Jan? last: in two
letters mentioned he had had indirect overtures from the Bashaw
of Tripoli to give up the Am@ Citizens prisoners to him for 500,
dollars, each in one letter - in the other for 400, dollars: I am
certain that the Bashaw of Tripoli never authorized such communication to be made to him, for a t that time I verely believe his demand
would have been five or Six times that Sum. I regret much that
Com. Preble, was so premature in communicating to our Govt
terms not coming [direct from the Bashaw?] - the low Sum I
should have supposed would have induced him to have suspected
the autenticity of his authority, and as he had writt,en a few days
previously to this Government puttin the question of ransom and
the Vessel had not returned to Ma ta which conveyed his letter
to Tripoli, I wish that he had postponed giving such informations
as I'm afraid it has induced our Govt to expect eace, or our liberation for a much less [sum] than I believe it will e possible for them
to obtain and may have [space] in the powers given the present Com.
to the protraction of the war I do not know his power, altho' I respect
Corn. Preble much, I can't help regreting his communication to our
Govc respecting an exchange of prisoners & ransom, for the remainder
I do not h o w the measures our Gov5 means to pursue to liberate
their unfortunate Citizens from bondage, but am of an opinion that
after their efforts next Summer it will be to its honor & interest to
conclude a peace on the best terms then attainable, for I believe
that it will not be in their power after that to reduce much, except
by sending an Army, but not Mussdmen.
Let me hear from you as soon as possible - I have not heard
from Commodore Barron - in the invisible please to communicate
the secret to him
Yours Sincerely

U. 6. Consul General, Algiers

VALE^ Nmr 221'1804
SIR,I n compliance with your request I have the honor to enclose
you with such extracts from my letters from Algiers, under date of
the 24'h of October. - As relates to the insurrection in Constantine;
and of adding thereto some reports on the same subject, which were
circulated in Algiers, on the first information of the Insurrection above
alluded to
Extraets from Letters
OCTOBER THE 1 7 ~ 3 A Courier arrived this day from Constantine
bringing accounts that the Marabout had mustered his forces before
that place, in three divisions of 30,000 men each and had cannon in
abundance. - The Be demands troops from the Dey for its defence. I t is also said that t e Bey of Constantine is taken by, or is in
favor, indirectly of the Marabout.
OCT? l a t h The Dey has this day appointed a new Bey for Constantine - A Turk of this City (Algiers). oc+ 2otQ This mornin the Aga went out with the new Bey for
Constantine, accompanie with 4 or 500 Soldiers.O C T ~234 Couriers arrived from Constantine saying the place wg be
lost forever to Algiers, if a strong force was not sent for its protection.The Dey has Ordered the Only three Polacres (or Sea Vessels) he has
now in Port to be got ready to take troops to that place (all his other
Cruizers having sailed on the :'1 of October). On the 21't OF MAY the Bey of Constantine arrived at Algiers to
pay his Customary Tribute to the Dey. He remained here till the
2gt3 OF MAY. The Tribute estimable at 600,000 Doll?
I n the LATTER PART OF JUNE the first accounts we r e d at Algiers of
an Insurrection in the district of Constantine, said to be conducted by
a Moor, who stiles himself a Marabout or holy Man; and that he had
collected upwards of 30,000 Arabs and made an Attack on Constantine
but had been repulsed; and a t the same time it was reported that he
had taken some French boats fishing for Coral on the Coast, and carried
54 Frenchmen into Captivity. - This caused a strong remonstrance
from the French Consul in Algiers to the Dey, who sent immediately
some armed Vessels to guard the Coast, and a considerable sum of
money to the Bey of Constantine to provide for the defence of the
place.
About the MIDDLE OF JULY reports from Constantine say that the
Marabout had compelled the French men whom he had taken to
become Mahometans. Other Reports, that the persons said to be
taken were French Officers & Engineers sent to assist the Marabout,
who, is in the Interest of France. But so various & Contradictory are
the accounts in Algiers respecting this business, that very little reliance
can be placed upon them. All regular Communication is cut off, and
tho the business appears formidable and threatening, no measures
seem to be taking to repel its effect

Ripoli

Dated 24 November, 1804.
"DEARSIR, "I hope you will excuse me for the liberty I take in
suggestin to you a few remarks which have occurred since my captivity. #he Bashaw has taken me from the prison where my fellow
officers are confined and ordered me to attend his sick slaves who are
principally Neapolitans, negroes, and our unfortunate crew. Some of
the latter I this morning saw chained to a cart loaded with stones
which they were dra ging through the town to repair the fortifications.
They complain muc of hunger, cold, hard labor, and the lash of the
whip. I confess I never saw any thing that wounded my feelings
equal to the sight of those poor fellows. I have libert to walk m
the town, but am attended by a Turk who is loaded wit weapons of
war. I am not allowed to visit any of the fortifications nor any of
the foreign consuls. Capt. Bainbridge's endeavors to relieve the wants
of his crew are often countermanded by our new masters. Five of our
countrymen hare turned Turks, and five have paid their last debt to
nature. Diarrhoea and Dysentery have often appeared amoo
Our
crew, but on a free use of Carbonate of Soda (Natron,) which is ound
m abundance in this country, and often whitewashing the walls of the
prison with lime where they sleep, it soon disappears. Our crew are
now very healthy.
During the several attacks upon this town by our squadron under
the command of commodore Preble, many Turks were killed and
wounded, and several men much burnt by the explosion of their own

powder. I had an opportunity of seeing their method of curing burns
in particular, many of which extended over the whole body. The
Bashaw has all of his wounded brought to an apartment in the Castle
where he visits them and makes them a present of ten dollars each.
He then orders his surgeons and Mamelukes to dress their wounds;
he often assists with his own hands. The mamelukes are his body
guards; the Marabouts are employed to expel evil spirits, and make
intercession with Mahornet their prophet, for their recovery. Those
that were burnt, were first anointed with honey, carefully preserving
the skin as much as possible and keeping the parts exposed to the air.
They then sprinkled the ulcerated parts, if any, with a fine powder of
white lead, (Cemse;) this is repeated at short intervals until a scab is
formed, that is carefully preserved until a cure is accomplished, which
is remarkably soon.
"I hope and expect that in due time my country will honorably and
to the astonishment of Barbarians and Tyrants liberate us from the
chains of sIaver;v, and restore us to our native land, that happy land
the thoughts of which is a healing balm to our souls in their miserable
bondage.

I enclose the President's Message relative to the destruction of the

that a Sword be presented in their name to Captain Decatur, and
they have provided a pecuniarg compensation for each of the other
Officers and for each of the Men engaged in the destruction of that
Frigate. I am happy to announce to you that the Senate have unanimously
confirmed the appointment of Captain Decatur.
Information has reached me through a channel which induces me
to give it full faith, that you have made two Attacks u on Tripoli
and that you were preparing for a third Attack - that f e two first
Attacks eventuated in the destruction of 3 Gun Boats and 1 Polacre,
and in the capture of 3 other Gun Boats, and considerable Injury to
the Fortifications of the Enemy. This information furnishes additional testimony of your energy and judgment - we sensibly feel
the value of our Services, and take pleasure in acknowledging them.
Be assured t at your Country Rill never prore ungrateful. I most ardently hope that ou will have accomplished the reduction
of Tri oli before the arriva of Commodore Barron's Squadron, so
that t e whole Glory of it's Reduction may be attributed to you.
Nothing however can deprive you of the reputation which You hare
justly acquired by the preparatory arrangements made by You for
this object, and by your Conduct in carrying those arrangements
into effect - and although your Successor may give the find Blow to

DEARSIR, The day being too far spent to make the mouth of the
Nile in Season on Friday we came to an Anchor in Abukir Bay, and
lay 'till two 0.Clock the next morning, this gave us an oppertunity of
viewing the Battle grounds there, which we found covered with human
Skeletons ghastly monuments of the Savage influence of avarice and
ambition on the human mind - Yesterday Morning we displayed
the fl of the United States upon our Gume [Germe or Jerm], and
about2ne 0.Clock P. M. entered the Nile several miles below Rosetta,
we were Recq by the Drogoman of the British Consulate in an elegant
Barge with Awnings bearing the National flag in which M' Blake and
myself proceeded to the landing, where we were met by Major Missett
his B. M. Resident a t Cairo, who accompanied us to his lodgings on
board the Barge - I met with my worthy friend Doctor Mendrici
of whom you [have] heard me speak so often and so warmly, who now
makes one of our party. I find it impossible to leave this for Cairo day after tomorrow, but
calculate to be beack in about ten days, when I ho e you will find it
convenient to be here. - You will find in Major issett a11 that can
be comprized in the term a Gentlemen, with the frankness of an old
Soldier, we certainly are very happy in our introductions from Governor Ball - I hew'd the Major regret last Evening that he had no
Porter, and that it was almost impossible to procure ~lriadeiraWine. I find my party encreasing, and am very desirous of seeing you here,
that I may have the benefit of your advice in some measures I am

afford both food and amusement to your people during your stay. At Alexandria the Water of the Nile exceeds discription in excellence
of quality, should you think proper to start the bad Water out of the

To Captain Samuel Barron, U. S. Navy, from Tobias Lear, U. S. Consul General,
Algiers

MALTA,
December 1 . 9 180.4 -DEARSIR,I had the honor of writing to you on the 6t5 instant, by
a Sparanaro [Speronare], which could not get out till the night before
last.
I forwarded, at that time, a letter for Commodore Preble,
from Constantinople, and an Extract of a letter from the British
Minister, a t that place, to Sir Alexander Ball, respecting the Wheat
Vessels sent in here by our Squadron.
On the l o t h instant arrived here the Ketch, to which you bad
given a passport to go to Tripoli. - M! Robertson brought the two
enclosed letters for you, which I took the liberty to open, in order to
send them by a special conveyance, if they should contain anything
to make it necessary. I found nothing in them which would uTarrant
the expence: But I hare this day seen Mr Robertson, who is in quarantine, and received from him such information as 1conceive makes
it proper to send it to you immediately.
He says that five Cruizers have sailed from Tripoli, vizt - two on
the 8t5, and three on the 10tQof November. - That one of them
had sent in a small Genoise Vessel, which had been converted into a
Gun Boat. - That two of the said Cruizers were destined for the
Coast of Spain and the Straits, and three to the Adriatic. They are
small Latteen Vessels carrying two Cannon each and about 60 men. That he (Robertson) was detained in Tripoli ten days after he was
ready to sail, waiting the arrival of two Vessels loaded with wheat
(u-hichhowever did not arrive), and of which they were afraid he would
give information to our Squadron. - He says they are in great
want of grain and other necessaries; and that their stock of powder
was very smail indeed. - They httd sent to Smyrna for that article
and other military stores. - He says the injury sustained by the
Attacks on the Town was reported to be very inconsiderable, and that
the Bashaw upasvery high in his language respecting the demands he
should make for peace tk ransome; but, he added, that he knew he
was greatly distressed for money and everything else necessary for
carrying on the war.
I received a letter from Captain Bainbridge by this opportunity,
wlictl, I presume, is to the same amount as those now enclosed from
him to you. - I also forward two letters for Commodore Preble; one
from the French Consul, and the other from Captain Bainbridge. Mr Robertson left Tripoli on the 5Q inst- He saw none of our Vessels
off when he came out, nor on his passage over here. - The other
Vessel which had a passport to go over for Bullocks &"s still there,
and is expected to wait until a convoy can be sent from hence to bring
her over.
On the 6th inst. Lieu; Cornd: Smith came in here in the 'b k e n , to get
a supply of bread, of which he says he had but three days allowance on
board. - He was detained here, by bad weather, until the night
before last. - He informed me that he left the President between this
and Tripoli, and that the weather had been so bad for some time past
on that Coast, that it was impossible, without. the greatest hazard,
to keep near the coast.
\Ye are vew anxious to hear of your health, and have been flattering
ourse1t.e~with the pleasure of seeing you over here for some days past.
This pleasing expectation we have not yet given up, and I hope this

may meet you on your way over. - The quarantine from Sicily
is reduced to five days, and in a few days more is expected to be taken
off entirely. I have thought the preceding information from Tripoli of sufficient
im~ortanceto dis~atcha S~aranaroto carrv this letter. - The Patrdn of the ~ ~ a r a g nwill
r o Gait your Orders for his return, if you should
have any letters to send over.
Mr*Lear unites with me in best wishes for your health, and in
respects and compliments to your brother, and our Officers with you,
and also to Mr Dyson.

13'ednesday Ecening 12 Deer
I have this moment received a letter from Algiers dated 4 Deer -

All was then well there as respected our affairs. - Their Cruizers
had not returned, nor sent in any prizes. There had been no late
accounts respecting the Marabout, which led them to be very easy
respecting him in Algiers. - The Portuguise Slave had lately made
their excape from thence, viz the Captain of a Brig of War taken about
6 years past, and one of the Lieutenants &- the Purser of the Frigate. [Mrs. James S. Barron Col. A copy also in Stephen Decatur Col, Book A.]

before this opportunity goes,

I shall be able to send you the declaration, & thus has her conduct to

us involved her in a T a r which she otherwise might easily have
avoided. - England was a t first by no means inclined to this war - the
thing that produced it, as I always told you, was the armament at*
Ferrol, which armament, as I well knew, through a Gentleman I sent.
down privately there to examine & see into it. -2s intended sole1
against us to increase their maritime force in the American Seas WI t i
five sail of the line & some Frigates, & to throw as lar e a body of
Troops as they could into Florida - Yrujo's threat of quadrons at
the Mississipi, Chesespeck & Sandy Hook, now prove this clearly to
have been the intention - The British Minister supposing i t a ainst
them, remonstrated firmly, & it was upon his demanding expkcitls
and strongly the reason of the Armament & their fear of telling the
tmth, that brought them into the war -- The consequences of w b ~ h
will be, I think, the obtaining all we want of Spain, &- the making the
Flag of the United States in a short time the only neutral one in the
World, for Denmark cannot avoid joining Russia & Sweden when they
begin seriously to act. I have some very curious & interesting details
to tell you of this business at another time, for having been prrvy to
the whole of the latter part of the secret negotiations here between
England & this Country, J know that England very unwillingly went
lnto this war - the demands of England on Spain, were so reasonable
that I was always sure Spai~lwould come into them, but she equivocuted so much, & really treated the Questions with such marked evasion,
that England was convinced all her charges were well founded, 6:
that she could not do less than treat her as a principal i,n the war This being the case, however we may as Philant'hropists msh the gencr-

al peace of all h'ations, yet if some of them, & particularly those now
engaged, will, in spite of all our wishes, go to war, we must console
ourselves by reflecting that our true security & interest are more promoted by war among the great maritime powers of Europe, than
peace - be assured there is not one of the iron despotisms of Europe
(& they are all such except, England) that has much affection for us R e are such an Eyesore, that I am convinced there is not one which
does not wish us sunk in the Sea, & even England has but a splenetic
cordiality for us - the increase of our Commercial Marine, now
treading fast on her own - the probability of our being, if not the
only, certainly dways tbe most respected neutral flag in the world the numbers & wealth this circumstance, connected with our freedom,
will draw to us, & the consequent increase of our Commerce, Bt when
we please, of our Naval force, will make England view us with jealousy - If you are supplied with their late -4uthors on political subjects, you must perceive many traces of this in their writings, & i t is to
be expected that this jealousy will keep peace with our rise. I am just
informed that this Government arc now deliberating on the propriety
of throwing open aU their Ports in the M'est Indies and South America
on certain conditions - this --ill be a great affair for our Merchants indeed with the circumstance of a general war & the astonishing price
of Prohions, had we not lost our wheat by bad Seasons, as you wrote
me, & the violent hurricane destroyed our rice in the Southern States,
the influx of riches this year would have perlisps exceeded any other The Spaniards are losing immense sums eveq day in the Ships d
cargoes taken by the British, & i t seems from the secret expeditions
preparing in England, unless France & Spain & Holland can make
some great effort by invasion they will have to bid adieu to all t,heir
Colonies & Commerce, as it is said to be one of Pitt's plans to root
France & Holland entirely out of the American Seas, & never to make
peace on the condition of restoring any thing to them in that Quarter
of the FCTorld, or suffering them ever to have any more agency or
interference in the West India Trade - I mentioned to you in my former letters that I had submitted to this Government all the statements
& explanations your instructions contained, & that they are now
waiting for advices by the Express Brigantine they sent to Yrujo,
with whose conduct & energy, as I wrote you before, they are so
pleased, that they are said to be determined on his return, to reward
him highly - their tone however to the United States must in future
be greatly moderated, for they cannot now venture to quarrel with
us, & if our Government is but a little resolute & decisive, they must
give way in every thing.

GRAND
CAIRODec: lSth 1804
SIR! Letters of recommendation from Sir Alexander Ball, to His
Britanic Majesty's Consul at Alexandria and resident a t Cairo have
had the effect to give security and perhaps may add success to this
expedition.
On the 30thTnt. we sailed from Alexandria for Rosetto, and arrived
the day following - Found there Major Misset, the British resident
who had left Cairo in consequence of the War which rages between the
Mamelukes and Turks; and which renders a residence here, a t this
moment both dangerous and disagreeable; for nothing can be more
fluctuating and capricious than the government in this Country,
except the disposition of the slaves over whom it dominates
The attention of Major Miset, the resident, though it cannot exceed
my gratitude, far exceeds any means I have of expressing it. Finding him a frank, open hearted, generous soldier - I unreservedly
unveild to him the object of my voyage. He took eve step, which
the nature of his situation would justify, to facilitate t at object and, to render our passage on the Nile and stay at Cairo safe and
agreeable, he directed his Secretary Captain Vincents to accompany
us, and to lodge us in the English house. I also fell in at Rosetto with Doctor hlendrici, of whom frequent
and honorable mention is made in my communucations to government from Tunis as the Bey's cheif physician - The Doctor was
sent out of that regency about a pear before me; and for reasons
if not analogous, equally cogent: myself for Wanting dispositions
congeneal to the in interest of the Bey. he for posessing dispositions
congenial to the interest of the Beys wife - He is here chief phgsician to the Vice Roy, Kourshek Ahmrt Pacha - and also to the
British commission
Having chartered a marche, specie of latin schooner peculiar to
the river, of about forty tons burthen, on the fourth instant we embarked for this ploce; our strength consistin of Lt OBannon of the
Marine Corps Midshipmen Geo Mann and 5 3li E. Danielson - Mr
Faryuhar. Selirn a janisary Alli a drogaman with six servants; all
well armed - Captain Vincents and Doctor Mendrici in another
Boat mounting two Swivels, besides Muskets, Pistols and Sabres, and
about an equal number of people: Precautions necessary to resist the
predatory attacks of the wild Arabs, who infest the rivers banlis and
during this general suspense of justice prey upon the defenseless; as
well as the outrage of the Abbauian turkish soldiery, who restrained
by no discipline ravage and murder indiscriminately every where The English and American flags were displayed on their respective
vessels. -

At 3 in the afternoon of the same da , without having obtained any
certain intelligence concerning the o ject in pursuit, we departed
from Rosetto; sailed tranquilly along the beautiful banks of the Nile;
and, on the evening of the seventh, arrived a t Bulac, in front of
Cairo, without accident. though we were at one time under some
apprehensions from a troop of wild Arabs which we saw fall furiously
upon a herd of Camels, buffaloes and cattle near the Village Sabour
and drive several of them off unannoyed. The shrieks of the Villagers
demonstrated their consternation and anxiety, while they offered no
resistance Co these mounted marauders of the desert: and these on
t,he other hand, appeared to aim no mischief towards the persons of
their inactive brethren of the plain - We had just returned on board
from visiting the Village - The Arab Camp were within half a
league; but the fire we raised from our fowling pieces upon the vast
numbers of pigeons m d other small fowl in its environs must have
deterred them from attempting to examine our baggage. They howeyer assailed and robbed several boats just after we had passed This same village was but the day before lundered by five hundred Albanians, who had desereted from t e Vice my's Army &
taken their r o u t to Damiette - Fortunate for us perhaps that they
had not stayed a day longer; for it is doubtful whether our appearance
would have been formidable to their avarice; or our resistance to
t,heir force - I make this digression to show the deplorable situation
of the inhabitants of Eygpt - Their prayer for the return of the
English is universal-and humanity prays m t h them.
On the morning of the eighth horses and attendants were sent from
the palace to convey us to Cairo; and at nine oclock we entered the
city, followed by a vast concourse of people of all ages and sexes
whom curiosity or want had collected about us; but a t that respectful
distance peculiar to the people of the East towards strangers of &istinction We passed as American Officers of the Army and Navy
u-hom curiosity had brought fromMalta, to Eygpt during the suspence
of Winter operations. This and the following day were chidy consumed in receiving md
returning visits: Among others a visit from the palace by the Viceroy's
interpreter, welcoming our arrival, and signifying that it would be
agreeable to his highness to wait on us a t the hall of audience in the
citidnl a t the third hour of the ninght of the next day This unusual
hour wrts fixed on b reason of the fast of Ramadam, during which
no refreshments can e given by day.
Mean time I employed all prudent means to put in motion the real
objects of my visit here - I found the Secretary of State and two
ex-Governors of Hamet Bashaw on the spot; destitute of every thhg
but resentment; for every hope had abandoned them - h o r n them
I learned that their Sovereign after a senes of vicisitude and disasters,
had been reduced to the alternative of joining the mamelukes; and that
he was actually with them in command of a few Tripolitans and the
Arab auxiliaries beseiged with Elfi; and the other mamelukes Beys in
the Village of Miniet in upper Egypt. Though glad to hear that the
Bashaw was still active and that the arabs were still attached to his
jnterest, the embarrassments which have hitherto accumulated to
impede the execution of our plan with him were now heightened by
the impossibility of personal access to him; the difficulty of communp
cation; and the uncertainty of obtaining the vice my's firman for h ~ s
departure, in case of succeedillg to detach him from the rebel army,

g

as the mamelukes are here stiled - These obstacles overcome, every
thing else seemed feasible - I resolved therefore to throw myself
on the honor and hospitality of the Turkish Sovereign of the Country
At eight in the evening of the ninth, six arabian horses richly
caparisoned, and a numerous escort of attendant waited in the court
yard of the British house to conduct us to the palace. Captain
%'incents
and Doctor M endrici accompanied in their nationd uniforms - The procession was preceeded by an illumination of flambeax and tourchesthe streets for the distance of a mile and a half
were margined with Spectators, curious to see the men who had come
from the new uiorld. Guards, grooms, and servants were stationed to
receive us a t the Gate of the Citadel - The Courbose[?]was parded
with troops regularly drawn up. The flights of stairs which lead to
the grand saloon were flanked with young men superbly armed, and
in rich turkish uniform - The hall was large and splendid and the
court which attended the Vice roy surpassed in magnificence every
thing I have ever seen of the kind - His Highness with a degnified
air of affability, rose from a sofa of embroidered purple and damask
cushions; and, taking my hand seated me next himself and the gentleCoffee- pipea & Sherbet
men in company on the ri ht and leftwere served in oriental sti e - The customary salutstions passed
and repeated questions on indefferent subjects asked and answeredNews of the day concerning the European WarEnquiries relative
to our nation situation and extent of our territory: Date of our independence? Nations with whom we were a t peace or war? Productions and commerce of the country &c. &c. At lenght by a signal
from his hand the court retired leaving the lice roy & his interprter
alone with us. He now observed that it seemed to him our visit to
this country a t so critical a moment must have something more for
its object than mere gratification of curiosity - This opened the
occasion, which I had deterrmned to seek, of making to him a candid
explanation of my business - I stated in french, which he seemed
well to understand but which was formally translated into Turkish,
a detail of our intercourse and relation with Tripoli - Negociations
of Peace with Jussuf Bashaw. Violation of his faith - Commencement of the Wsr and such events in its progress as honor did not dictate to conceal: then drew a Battering though just contrast between
habits of the Barbary princes and those of other provinces of the
Ottoman Empire - He listened with attention and evident gratification - Varying a little the subject, I touched upon the affinity
of principle between the Islam and American religion; both taught
the existence and supremacy of one God: (Let not triune christans
startle at the emphasis placed on this numeral adjective it is not
meant to employ that unity may not be composed of congregated
members to suit any faith!) both enjoined the universal exercise of
humanity: and both forbade unnecessary bloodshedHe acknowledged these to be maxims of his religion - I declared that we sought
in his province, a legitimate sovereign of Tripoli, who had been
treacherously driven from his Government and country, in whose
good faith we might place reliance, and whom we intended to restore
to his throne; and, so doing stamp conviction on the world that we
did not unsheath the sword for conquest nor for spoil, but to vindlcate our rights; and, that we were ready to seize any honorable mean
to prevent the further effusions of blood; and more especially as we
found that, in prosecuting tho war against the faithless Jussuf, the

f

severity of our resentment fell rather upon the innocent deluded victims of his avarice and hypocricy than upon the aggressor himself
He approved our resolutions said he knew Hamet Bashaw - Had
furnished him supplies for temporary purposes of subsistenoe - but
knew not where he was a t this moment. He assured us, however
that if within his influence, he would by all means aid the accomplishment of a measure so manifestly humane; observing that his predecssor had promised auxiliaries to Hamet Bashaw for this very
purpose as soon as the tranquility of this Country, would admit
After a moments reflection he added, that in case the Bashaw
should have joined the rnamelukes, which was possible i t might change
the dispositions he would otherwise make concerning him, I replied
thnt an object of disstres could not be an object of resentment to an
exalted mind; and that i t was more like God to pardon than to punish
a repenting enemy. By an inclination of his head he signified assent
and promised to send couriers in search of Hamet Rashaw; which he
has done so have IAnd, through the intervention of my friend
Doctor hlendrici who has great influence a t court, and of the Vice
roy's chief interpreter, whom we have gained, there is no doubt of
obtaining his permission for the embarkation of the Bashaw & his
suit. The only embarrassment now is, how he will be able to ~ 4 t h draw himself from the cause of the mamelukes without exciting
suspicion of treason, which might prove fatal to him. If he can do
this, we may think the most d i E c d t part of our plan accomplished;
for I have the fullest assurance and as full confidence that th[r]ough
his influence, we may bring any number of men on the back of Tripoli
which may be deemed requisite to its entire success- and this done,
with our naval force in front all supplies wiU be effectually cut off
from the enemy.I shall remain here yet twelve days for the return of a special courier
dispatched this morning to the Bashaw then return to Rosetto - and
Alexandria except circumstances should engage me to proceed through
the desert from this to Bengazi; in which case the gentlemen in comany will make no delay in descending the Nile, and repairing on
goard tho Argw with further communications
Beleiving a sentinel at this out post to be a precaution necessary to
the successful issue of our measures, and that an agent here may hare
some good effect on our commercial interests; and influenced no less
by a just sense of obligations, T have requested Doctor A!fandrici to
accept this trust. A Copy of m letter of appointment is here with
inclosed - I hope this step r d m e s t the approbation of the President. A list of the articles which enter into the commerce of this
country with the prices current will be forwarded on a future occasion;
either to y o u . Department or to some cornmercjal house which may
take a direct interest in it Decern lVh
Last evening, at an audience with the Vice roy after reproaching
Hamet Bashaw for taking part with the Mamelukes he was prevailed
on to grant him a letter of anmesty and permission to him to pass the
turkish army and leave Egypt unmolested It now remains to detach

GRANDCAIRO
Dec: I S . 1804
SIR, If intrusion in this instance demands an apology I hope it mag
be found in the principle of humanity, which prevails to overcome the
reluctance I should otherw-ise feel at being thought intrusive.
The same reasons which induced me to request of Your excellency
letters of introduction to his Britanic Majesty's agents in this Country,
suggested the propriety of showing an English Jack at the Main Top
gallant mast head on entering the old port of Alexandria the 26th ult.
The signal was recognized and Mr Briggs was immediately on board.We found in port a Turkish Vice admiral, with a ship of the line
and six frigates - a part of which squadron is stationary there to preserve the tranquility of the country; with just as much iduence as
the same number of Pilicans would have on the same station
On entering and passing the streets Of Alexandria I could not but
notice the very marked satisfaction which every expression and every
countenance of all denomitiations of people, Yurks and Frenchmen
only excepted manifested under an impression the we were the avant
coureur of an English Army They had conceived this idea from observing the english Jack at our main, taking our flag, perhaps, for that
of a saint; and because as is natural enough they were ready to beleive
what they ardently wished I t would been cruel to have undeceived:
consequently without assuming, we passed in character of Englishmen
among the Middle & lower orders of people; and as allies among those
of better information Wherever we entered or wherever halted we
were surrounded by the wretched inhabitants; and stunned With their
benedictions and prayers for blessing on us"'STill the english
come? Are they coming? God Grand the English may come! We
have no commerce - we have no money - We have no bread!
When will the english arrive?
My answer was uniformly Patience: on arriving at Rossetto 1''
instant, the attentions we received from Major Miset, who had retired
hither to evade inridents to be apprehended from the distracted
state of the capital were such as the 1et.ters we brought him were
were Calculated to secure civility and goodness, however are the natural
effusions of his heart The same tone which marked the dispositions
of the Alexandrians was heard at Rosetto; but not so loud, because
the inhabitants are less miserable without any traits of happiness.
On the 4'h we left that Village for Cairo, - And to give security
as we11 as accommodations to our voyage and to our stays here the
Resident directed his Secretary, Captq Vincents to accompany us
and to give us lodgings at his house. We ascended the Nile leisurely and calling at several villages, it was plainly perceiveable that the
national partiality which so openly & strongly expressed the feelings
of the Egyptians of the Sea Coast was general through the country;
and the prayers for the return of the English as earniest as universal
On the morning of the 6" we went on shore at the Village Sabour
The villagers expressed an enthusiasm of gladness at seeing red and
blue uniforms and round hats (The french I believe wore triangular)
Two days previously five hundred Albanian deserters from the Yicemy's m y had pillaged and left this villa e in which they had lived
at free quarters about four weeks. - !'he famishing inhabitants
were now distressed with Apprehensions from an other quarter - A

company of wild arabs were camped in sight. They dreaded their
ravages; and apprized us of danger from them. we were eighteen in
the party, well armed; and a pretty brisk fire which we raised among
the numerous flocks of pigeons and other small fowl in the invirons,
must have deterred them from any mischief which they might otherwise have meditated against us. Scarcely however were we an board
and under way when we saw these mounted marauders of the desert
fell furiously upon the herds of camels, buffaloes and cattle of the
village, and drive many of them off without annoyance They afterwards attacked and robbed several unarmed boats which were a few
hours astern of us - Imensibility itself would have been moved a t the
deplorable situation of the peasants of that village - While listening
to their complaining they kissed our hands; and, with prostrations
to the ground and eyes inflamed with anguish implored Eqlish
succor. - Shrieks of dispair a t the assault of the wild Arabs testfied
the additional cause they had to weep and implore - I confess I
felt an all most insurmountable impulse to bring our little party to
their releif and should perhaps have done a rash act had not been for
the cool observations of Captqincents that There were common occurences and that any reley we could eject would be indeed but temporary!
On the morning of the 7 s we landed on the east bank of the river
near a village. At our approach the villagers fled signals of friendship brought some of them to us; when told we were Englishmen
they flocked around us with demonstrations of joy; offered us their
services; and raised loud ejaculations for our establishment in the
country. - Here we could not procure a pint of Milk for our Coffee
The inhabitants had been plundered and chased from their habitations by the Albanians and desert arabs; - and it was but the preceeding da they had returned to their naked cottages.
Grand
iro differs from the places already passed only as the
presence of the tyrant stamps silence on the lips of misery with the
seal of terror. Pale Wretchedness and dumb melancholly stalk here!
But where a whisper is uttered it is in concert with those less restrain'd
voices Why this misery, and spirit of revolution? from a despotic or
rather a total want of Government! Egypt has no master: thou h
the most frightful despotism. The Turkish soldiery, restrained y
no discipline sieze with the hand of rapine, every thing for which
passion creates a desire The mamalukes, who dispute with these the right of domination,
subsist them selves by means not much less oppressive, if more supportable, and the wild arabs, availing themselves of the occasion
plunder the defenceless wherever they find plunder - To finish this
this scene of quadruple outrage the talons of the Vice roy fix on
every thing which can be changed into currency in order to find the
means of supporting an ungoverned disorganized banditti of foreign
Troops, who receive the bruits of his oppression; desert, and betray
him - of all this rapine robbery and extortion the wretched cultivaters of the soil are the perpetual victims A spirit of revolution

gradually annihilate itself -.
A very small foreign force therefore
may take the possesion and the government of Egypt; but when
once established here, it would require exertions to effect another
change The reason the inhabitants of this Country give for preferring the
English to the French-whether true or false is as natural as it is
Simple, and as influential s s natural" The English "say they" pay
for every thing: the French pay nothing and take every thing They dont like this kind of deliverers If any thing expressed in this sheet should, in any degree have
iduence to procure the establishment of a rational government in
this delightsome country of m~serabletenants, the object of this
hasty sketch is accomplished - It is submitted to discretion presumlng it will be considered that my mane can be of no use but to
testify the sencerity with which I have to honor to be
December 16.
The forces of the Mamalukes Beys at Miniet, upper Egypt; said
to be about 3000
exclusive of arabs, - The Turkish army in
the same vicinity; said to consist of 8000 Albanian and Levant
Turks. - There has lately been a battle between them Each
party claim the Victory; because the MamaIukes gaFe no ground,
and the Turks were not defeated though by the best information
i t appears they run away The friends of the mamelukes have
brought them the Albanians, in retrograde as far as Benisuef.
The Government as the Turks stile themselves. have set them down
around the walls of Miniet Wherever they are, I prophecy their
distruction; for the principle is innate and inextricable - a total
Want of Discipline and t,otal insubordination neither impelled by
patriotism nor influenced by honor
But they have men encounter.
Occupied by the mamelukes the Government seems wholly to have
neglected the defence of the coast; except such as can be
by the
naval detachment Alexandria. Even at. that place the ortifieations
are falling to ruins, and are almost entirely without troopsAs to the Banks of the Kile - if itis [its] defence depends on the
ganisons there stationed, three regular bnttallions would be sufficient
to meet all resistance which they could oppose to a march to Cairo
If I had not been heretofore acquainted with the carless and indolent
habits of the Turkish military I certainly should suspect that treachery had exposed this coast to an invader It is possible however the
Vice Roy is ignorant of the, true situation. I t is certain that his commanding general bears on hs Muster & pay rolls eighty thousand men;
when he has not nine thousand in the field the Vice roy has not authority to cause a muster and review- as an unsuccessful experiment
has demonstrated.-

EXCELLENCY
The six Gun Boats, and two Bomb Vessels, which his Majesty,
the Ring of the Sicilies, generously loaned the United States of America
the last Summer, were of very essential service t,o thesquadron under
my command in several a t t a c h which we made on the City and
Shipping of our common Enemy - the Tripolines
I with great pleasure acknowledge the gallant conduct of the Neapolitan Gunners, and other of his Majesty's subjects attach'd to them,
and am certain that the earliest opportunity will be inproved by my
government to tender suitable acknowledgements to his Majesty.
In consequence of the situation of the City and harbour of Tripoli,
it is necessary, in order to carry on our operations against that Regency
with the greater effect, that we should have Bomb Vessels and Gun
Boats; and as they cannot with sttfety be navigated across the Atlantic,
Commodore Barron, my successor in command of the American Squadron employ'd against Tripoli, has therefore requested me, in the name
of the Unit>edStates, to solicit his hlajesty, the King of the Sicilies,
for the further assistance of that description of Vessels - Should
his Majesty be pleased to grant our request, Commodore Barron
will want twelve Gun Boats and six Bomb Vessels, to be ready for
service by the first of may next. The Bomb Vessels to be furnish'd
with Mortars and Shells, and the Gun Boats with their proper Cannon,
small arms, and shot suitable for the Calibre of the Cannon, as we
have none of that Calibre
Spars,
Commodore Barron will furnish all the Boats with
Rigging, and Sails, t o be fitted out as cutters, and wiI1, if agreeable to
his Majesty, take into our service, fifteen Neapolitans for each Boat,
who shall receive double pay
The United States will compensate for the expenditure of Ammunition, and for the use of the Boats in any way that his Majesty may
think proper
The Neapolitans employ'd in the G u n Boats and Bombs the last
Summer h a ~ been
e
paid and satisfied a t Messina, and I request to
be made acquainted how, or in what manner, we are to compensate
for the expenditure of Ammmunition on board the Boats, duringour
lest operations against Tripoli
Your Excellency will greatly oblige me by endeavouring to procure
me an answer as early as possible that I may be able to leave this
Bay, as (for the want of Anchors) the situation of our Frigate would
be rather unsafe in case of a heavy gale of Wind

notwithstanding the amount thereof had been repeatedly offered in
Cash.
These Vessels are the Eagle of New York. Nathaniel Shaler Master,

The two former have been in this port upwards of 40 days. The
Schooner has not arrived & is supposed to have made some other
port. The people on board these Vessels have been treated very well
& no pillage of any Kind has been committed.
I have now the honor to inform you that I have adjusted this business with the Dey, who has received the ammount of two years
annuities due in Cash &- the Vessels are liberated & that our Commerce
will receive no further molestation from the Cruizers of this Regency.

200

hTAT7AL OPERA TIOATSFROM 1804 TO 180.5

that it cannot be effected to advantage for us there - This Bashaw
has pride and courage sufficient to have himself treated as an independant ruler - I am unacquainted with the Gov$ of Tunis, and
before my captivity I supposed this Regency subordinate in a great
degree to that power & Algiers, but a t present I am of a very different
opinion and firm$ believe that it will be to the interest of our Country
to treat direct w ~ t hthis power - and any expected assistance thro'
the Bashaw's exiled brother or either of the other States of Barba ,
will prove fallacious - And if our Country expects to get us li erated for the Sum which Corn. Preble stated in his official communication of Jan? last, I am convinced they will be deceived, altho'
they should extend the war t,o a considerable length - After t'he
efforts of our Squadron next Spring & Summer I am clearly of opinion
that it will be to t,he interest of the U. S. to make peace on the best
terms they can get, for I c a ~ oconceive
t
any advantage to be derived
from a continuance of the war - a great expence will occur, and
the reduction of the Bashaw's demand will not be much if any except that the U. S. u~ouldsend an army t,hen she might prescribe
terms, otherwise she will hare to pay for the freedom of her Citizens The attack which I presume is contemplated on the town nest
summer no doubt will do some in'ury to it, and it is natural to conclude that i t will make the Bas aw more desirous for peace; but
I do not suspect that it will be so formidable as to release us from
here for a small sum - Believe me that Tripoli can never be starved
by the most rigid blockade, except that the Heavens should deny
rain in the seasons - this year they have been most bountiful the blockade affects the town considerably, and I hope it will be
continued thro' the winter - every distress will assist towards a
desire for peace, but we must not calculate too largely on the distresses of the inhabitants in bring[ing] the Bashaw to terms - He
is absolute and feel but little regard for the interest of his Subjects but do not suppose that such Sovereignity is likely to make his
subjects revolt no, it is not oppressed ignorant that we expect to
see rise in demand of just rights. - If I have differed from
my friend, in opinion respecting the adjustment of our Tripoli's
affairs in Tunis, it is owing to my knowledge of this Gov+,and ignorance of that of Tunis - but I join heartely with you on t,he plan
of your coming & residing here - it most unquestionabIy would
be attended with great advantages You could communicate to
Gov! freely & justly on t'he situation of their affairs with this Regency?
and your opinion would be received as unbiaced by a chained situation - and this Govt, if once they give their sanction to your residing
here, would no doubt consider you free and hare communication
with you on national matters which they will never have with me
whilst a prisoner - How far it would be practicable to get the
permission of the Government thereon I can't say. - I trust you
wiU do me the justice th&t my . . . . . . . & opinion are not in
the least influenced by my unhappy situation - No, I declare
where my Country is effected I shall be among the number of the
last to wish it to accede to deshonorable terms - but I trust that
I shall not be accused of feeling a want of proper respect for its dignity when I say that I do not conceive its honor can be effected

19*?December 1804
( T ~ FebY
c ~ ddt$ 1805)
MY DEAR SIR, Your much esteemed favor of the 2 8 s Augt last,
came to hand on the 15Q instant. I wrote to you on the 14 Ulto,
since which nothing has transpired.
I am daily expecting to hear from Commodore Barron, and to receive the letters from our friends in America, which he detained until
he heard from me. I t is now nine months since I have received any
letters from my friends in that quarter of the Globe, and not one word
from Government since my unfortunate captivity. However, I feel
sensible of the sympathy of our countrymen, and have the fullest
confidence that every exertion will be made by the Government to
release us as soon as possible on just terms.
I trust that His Excellency, the Bashaw of Tripoli, will concieve it
his interest fo be a t peace with our nation: - your remarks on the
strength of our country are just, and that we are daily rising to a pitch
of importance, is no less true. The entire ignorance of the Barbary
powers to our present national respectability, and to our rapid progression, may make such language appear to them strange and unfounded; but time, that never failing monitor, will reveal the fact,
and withdraw the veil which covers them against their interest. You
must naturally sup ose that I am very desirous for peace, and sincerely
hope that a reconcgation will soon take place between His Excellency,
the Bashaw of Tripoli, and our country ; but I cannot expect it on
terms incompatible to our national character.
Your kind sympathy and generous wishes, my friend, are sincerely
felt by me. I also feel much indebted to mp friends in Algiers for
their remembrance, particularly to Monsr Thainville and Consul
Bille; - these are gentlemen in whose society I have spent some
pleasant hours, and shall ever remember i t with pleasure, - pray
p
t them my sincere regard. I hope that Madame Thainvllle
&9 had a pleasant passage to France, and will have an agreeable stay
at Paris.

Dec' 20 t @ 1804
SIR I t has been intimated that the failure of Cap! &/Iorrisin accomplishing the objects for which he was sent to the Me$ was in a degree
owing to my unauthorised return to the U. S., it has been even suggested that Government did not view my conduct in this particular
without dissatisfaction, & I have too much reason from v b o u s occurrences to beleive that the suggestion is not without foundation
I feel the utmost anxiety that my whole conduct shoud be fairly
understood, if I have erred, i t has been the error of the head, only,
but if I have erred, no matter from what motive I ought not to desire,
nor do I desire, to escape the just consequences of that error, in the
present instance, I hope it is only necessary for my vindication, that
the precise truth shoud be known - At Malaga an open Letter
dated Octr 23@ 1802 was put into my hands, by Cap; Rodgers a Letter
not open by the seal being broken, but which had never been sealed,
the object of this was to direct that the Frigate Constellation under
my Command, & the Chesapeake shoud be immediately sent to the
U. S., it being as the Letter expressed, the Presidents deslre, that those
Fri ates shoud not Winter in the MedQs C a p a o r r i s was then 1200
hf' es to the Eastward of me, & in the Month of h'ovr, I considered
the circumstance of the Letter being unsealed, intended for no other
purpose, but that the Commanders, shoud, they then chance to see
the Letter before Cap! Morris, ought to obey the order, the more especially as the period for which my Crews were engaged, woud expire
before I coud arrive in the U. S. & without waiting for his Commands,
so Cap: Rodger8 ce? Cap! Campbd thought & so indeed I coud not bud
think again in like circumstances, I considered that I was doing my
Duty in compIying with the order in the sense it was intended, by
returning home without delay, no conditions being thereto annexed,
& Cap! Morris did not then think I acted improperly, for he immediately sent the Chesapeake after me, & subsequent events shews that
he had still as strong a force as was then deemed necessary for the
execution of his plans I pray Sir that you will not deem this intrusion impertinent, nor
even unnecessary if as I fear doubts of the impropriety of my conduct
hath reached your Ear, I have the most ardent desire to deserve the
confidence of the Executive, & to obtain it, which has prompted the
liberty of this address, for to my great mortification, I have conceived
that all confidence, or trust hath been withheld from me since my
return from the Med? I have revolved in my mind all the occurrencas
during my respective stations, and f 5 d nothing unfavorable to my
as an officer, who after long & arduous services during the
feerinps
Revo
utionary War, as well as since the organization of our present
Naval establishment, thought myself entitled to a command, & I am
bold to say that upon a fair investigation of my eneral conduct,

SIR I have laid before the King your Application dated the 15t4
Inst, by which you evince the desire that the Squadron of the United
States may again present itself next Spring before Tripoli, & request
that this Royal Marine Department will furnish in may next, Twelve
Gun Boats and Six Bombs Vessels with their requisite Ammunition
& a part of their Crews, in Conformity to what has taken place this
Year. - His Majesty is infinitely happy in having been able to
contribute in the past Campaign towards furnishing the means of
attack against the Common Enemy, & would earnestly wish to be
enabled to concur a second time in the same object, but the Coasts of
the Two Kingdoms being continually molested by all the Squadrons
of the Barbary Regencies to the immediate Detriment of his Coasting
Trade, He finds himself under the necessity of employing his Gun
Boats, & Bomb Vessels in the needful Defence of his extensive Coast,
& in protecting his numerous Commerce by preventing the continual
Landings which the Barbarians effect daily, whereby they unfortunately make Slaves of many of his Subjects who claim assistance
for the safety of the Coasts, which can not be more effectually protected than by the Boats in question
I have on this occasion in the name of His Majesty to return
infinite thanks to Your Goodness for the attention & favors which
you have granted to his Crews, & in particular to the officer Anthony
Mapi, whom you have distinguished with those marks of generosit
which are analogous to the Sentiments of your Government, & wit

I shall do everything in my power that the most prompt and active

Actan assured me, that we should have no difficulty in procuring what
Bomb Vessels and Gun Boats we might want for the next Summer's
siege; and a supply of Ammunition, if we should not receive a sufficient
quantity from the United States in Season. He gave me a letter to
the Prime Minister, and one to their Majesties. They were in the
Country when I arrived, a d i t was not until eight days after, that
they came to the City; when my letters were delivered by the Prime
Minister: Soon after, I was introduced a t Court, and had an audience the Queen (the King having left the City the same day he arrived)
received me graciously, and professed a very friendly disposition
towards the U S
The Heads of Department assured me, that whatever I asked in
behalf of my Government would be granted; and the Minister of
Marine desired me to present to him in writing our requisition, which
he would make known to the King; this was accordingly done. I
waited with the utmost anxiety and impatience for an ansu7er until
yesterday, when I wrote a note to the Minister of Marine urging the
necessity of one, as our Frigate lay much exposed in the Bay, where
we had already parted one cable, and broke our tm70 largest Anchors.
This day I r e d the answer, and to my utter astonishment and disappointment i t was directly the reverse of what I was led to believe it
would have been. Some Interest more powerful than ours, has been
working against us. I presume it is not for the Interest of the French,
that we should have Peace with Tripoli, while they are at war with
England, and that Nation in possession of Malta: as our blockade
cuts off their supplies of fresh provisions from that Quarter. I also
presume that the English are not willing that we should take the
Gun and Mortar Boats from Sicily, as they want them to protect
#e Straits of Messina t o prevent the landing of the French in case
they should be SO disposed. In fact Mr E - the B - Minister at
Naples told me in confidence, that the King of Kaples had long since
stipulated with the 3:Govt that he would keep constantly e uipped
and Mann'd ready for Action 35 Gun and Mortar Boats at Ib essina,
but notwit,hstanding this stipulation, they have not yet one third
part of that Number prepared. He told me, that he was astonished
when he heard of our obtaining those that we did the last summer
without his knowledge; I therefore presume that he has protested
against our hax-iriflg them. I enclose you a copy of my requisition,
and the Answer m Atalian, whlch Mr Higgens will translate for you
readily & correctly. The King expressed much satisfaction at the
use that had been made of his Boats; and has refused to receive any
compensation for the Armnunition which was expended, and amounts
to more than twenty thousand Dollars. I can assure you that I
have endeavored all in my power to procure the Boats: and so anxious
have I been while at Kaples, that I never once have been out of the
City; nor have I visited any of the curiosities in it. The moment I
r e d the Answer, we prepared to sail, and shall go to Sea this evening,
and proceed. directly for the U: S. without stopping a t any other
lace excepting Gibraltar for provisions. I have written to Commo?
Earnon, and have advised him to purchase Sparonarm to be fitted as
Gun Boats, and to Endeavour to procure Mortars and Shells at
Gibraltar.

&3rd December 1804
DEARSIR, Our passage from Messina to Palermo, and from thence
to this place was long and boisterous; and our detention here far
beyond my expectations General Acton assured me a t Palermo,
that we should have all the Boats & ammunition we might want
on my application to the &g through the proper Dept On my
arrival here, I was flattered by the Ministers of State that we should
succeed. The King was absent at the time we arrived, and did not
come to Town until the 15th, when my requisition was presented,
favorably received, and every enaouragement given. 1 waited with
the utmost anxiety and impatience until this day before I received
an official answer; when to my utter astonishment and regret it
was precisely the reverse of what I was induced to believe it would
have been. - Some influence more powerful than ours, has occasioned this change. The French Influence here, as well as a t Tripoli,
is certainly against us. I t is for the Intereat of that Nation to keep
us at War with Tripoli, SO long as they are a t War with England,
and that Kation in possession of Malta; of course they will use their
influence to endeavour to deprive us of the means of reducing that
Regency to Peace.
I am sensible this disappointment will considerably affect Commodore Barron whose prosperity and success with the Squadron
under his Command, I most ardently pra for. I think it possible
notwithstanding the determination of the overnment that the Boats
may yet be obtained through General Acton's influence with the
King: if commodore Barron could go to Palermo and see him. He
must not however depend too much on success even from that
quarter I t is my opinion that the large Sparonaras would make good
G: Boats, and be more managable than those we had last Summer;
and I have no doubt but that Mortars &c"ay
be procured a t Malta,
and mounted to advantage on board of good stout Feluccas, which
can be hired or purchased there.
In consequence of our long detention here, I shall sail direct for
the United States, without stopping a t any other port, in order
that our Government may be informed of the disappointment as
early as possible - We get under weigh this evening.

the English Consul, and several Otficers from the Brig, we were treated
very politely, he gave us Coffee Sweetmeats &c, after staying about
half an hour with him we paid a visit to the Commandant of the

appears happy to see us, the people of the country, the Consuls of
different Nations, French and Spanish excepted, they did not hoist
their flags on our entering the Harbor, nor have I received their
Visits, though all the other Consuls have called, I suppose they must
have received their lesson from the French consul a t Tripoly, On the 2gt@Mr Eaton, Mr Farguhar, Lieu! 0,Bannan of Marines
Midshipman M a m & Danielson, left this for Rosetta, and from
thence to Cairo, where they arrived on the StQAfter stopping two
days at Rosetta, - I have received a letter from Mr Eaton informing me of the very flattering manner in which they were received by
the Vice Roy, every attention was paid them and he offered to render
them every service in his power, I have been informed since that
Mr Eaton had obtained a pass from him for the Bashaw to pass the
Turkish army, Although he has been with the Mamilukes fighting
against the Turks for some months, We had been informed previous to Mr Eatons leaving this, that
the Bashaw was with the Mamelukes about two days Journey from
Grand Cairo in upper Egypt, and Mr Eaton left a letter to him with
me, which I got translated and forwarded, two days after he left
this, and he forwarded a second from Rosetta and it appears that
Major Messett had heard that uTewere Coming here, and wrote to
Hamet Bashaw to that effect, so that with the Assistance of our
friends here and a number of men of Respectability in Grand Cairo,
which Mr Eaton has met with who are attached to the Bashaw I
have no doubt but we shall be able to get him on board, or make use
of him from this, I have a letter from Mr Eaton of the lgth ins! he informs me that
he waits the return of a special Courier, which He sent off, to the
Bashaw on the 13th, and expects it will return about the 26t@at which
time he will leave Cairo for Rosetta and this place. should the Courier
arrive at the time He expects, and lieleav's Cairo on the 26t@,or even
on the first of January, we should be ready to sail from here by the
lot@or 15t@,but I think it very uncertain whether he leav's Cairo
for some time yet should the man be found and determined to come
with us, it will take some time for him to prepare to leave this Country,
so that should we be detained longer than the time I have stated, I beg you will not be uneasy about us, we have a h e safe harbor and
a friendly Country, - I shall be in no want of provisions we have
plenty of Buffaloes, which I give the Crew every day in order to save
the salt provisions for our voyage down
I know of no opportunity for Malta after the Vessel sails that
brings this, so that you must not expect to hear from us until1 we
arrive, which perhaps will be much longer than I calculate, I shall
however do every thing in My power to expedite our departure from
this, - I n closing this letter I cannot but repeate to you the civilities we have received from the British Consul here, and Major Missett
British resident, and Mi. Patrucha British Consul a t Rosetta, they

24'h December 1804.SIR On the lgt@Inst the United States Frigate Constitution arrived
here from Syracuse and proceeded for Lisbon without anchoring.Understanding from Captain Rod ers tlhe John Adams is on her
nay Down the Straits and in hopes 8aptain Chauncy may call here,
I have made second copies of the Letters I have had the honor of
addressing you from N Q82 to 86 inclusive, to be transmitted by that
conveyance. I have been enduced to trouble you with these, for the greater certainty of your being in possession of the whole of what I have seen
proper to la before you, on subject of my apprehensions that this
Country wil take part in the War with Tripoly. - You have been
told of the Emperours intention of sending Wheat there last Summer,
it was on knowing that would not be permitted by the American
Squadron, that he changed the destination of his three Ships, all intended for the Mediterranean, and ordered them to be fitted for a
Cruize. Instructions for that purpose was sent by two of his particular
Friends to the Governours of Salle 8: Larach and to Tetuan a t same
time. The night these Messengers arrived with Alcayde Hashash he
mote me complaining of the opposition made to the mentioned Cargo
of Wheat being sent, and said "grant this Passport and Peace will
continue to subsist between us and you" - This was the first cause
pf my alarm. -Subsequent advices from my Friends a t Rhabat and
in other Channels strengthened my suspicions of the Emperours
intentions to resent the disapointment. I conceived it my duty to write to Sidy hluhammed Selawy on the
subject, but being a delicate point to write a Minister on, I availed
of the opening Alcayde Hashash's indescreet expressions offerred, and
you have seen his answer; - to my reply of the 26t'! August (copy of
which was transmitted also to you with NQ81) I never have received
any answer, nor has he written me a Letter since, notwithstanding I
sent h i a couple of Canary Birds he had asked me for. - Neither
has Alcayde Hashash answered my Letter saying the Meshouda could
not put to Sea during the War with Tripoly, but I knew he expressed
great dis-satisfaction on the occasion, and even went so far as to say

K Q88.

should the Emperour order me out of the Country again, that I
should not have the indulgences shewen me in 1802. It is my decided oppinion that had not Commodore Barron arrived
so opportunely and left the two Frigates he did on this Station, the
Frigates on their last Cruize would have had orders to detain American Vessels.The supplying Tripoly with Wheat I am persuaded
will be required by Muley Soliman, and that a denial will be the cause
he will assign for taking part in the War in their behalf. - M: Jarvis
will no doubt have acquainted you of the Emperours Agent a t Lisbon
having bought an armed Brig. - I am told he is to purchase two
more a t that place and then proceed to England. - I shall only add
that I still think it will be ext'remely proper to have some Vesesls of
War on this station as earl as possible in the Spring, a couple of
Frigates and two Brigs or Sc ooners \%-illbe quite sufflcirnt to prevent
their doing any thing, whatever their present intentions may be. -

Letter to the Secretary of the Navy and all the Letters you left with
me to forward, goes by Cap: Thorn enclosed to M' Higgins at Malta He sails tomorrow, and will most likely arrive some time before mre
shall. - I have made arrangements for paying hlessr? Briggs the
Thousand Dollars, which you inform me ou had drawn for, but as for
the four or five Thousand you say you s all want - God knows how
we are to obtain that, unless you have the means a t Cairo, for I
know of none here. - I am already pennyless, and the disbursements of the Brig amounts to more money a t present than our Credit
on Messr%Briggs, so th%t if we can avoid it we must not enter into
many engagements for Cash under our present circumstannes. - I
am anxious to hear whether you can get any intelligence from our
friend, and what our prospect is, you inform me that provision must
be made for an hundred Men - it cannot be possible that he has
that number about him should it be found so, we shall not be able to
carry F'rovisions and -dater for them for any length of time, not even
for a passage down a t this Season of the year.The plan you have formed of taking Derne, I think rather a Hazardous one, unless the Bashaw can brin into the field from Eight hundred to one Thousand Men, particu arly as we are destitute of every
article necessary for an expedition of the kind - I am willing to
grant you, that a very few men will take the place, and hold it, yet
they must have the means, they must have and be sure of supplies,
which is out of our power to promise them - I think the most we
can do, is to get the Bashaw, make as many friends in this Countv
as possible, and make the best of our way to Syracuse, get some little
addition t
o our force, and make arrangements for our being supported, when we have got possession, and set off anew for Dern or
Bengane as may appear most proper, from the information you must
have gained however a t Calro, you must be better acquainted ~ l t h

a better judge. - You must be satisfied that it is my wish to do
every thing in my power before we return, but when I look a t the
situation we are sent here in, I loose all patience - With a little
Vessel, without friends, without authority to act, without a single
friend except such as we have by our own good fortune procured in short, without everything that is absolutely necessary to insure
success to an Enterprize - I say as I have said before, that I do
not see that anything more then getting the man can be done should we be fortunate enough to get him, I think it will be doing a
great deal, and I am sure good use may be made of him with proper
management and supplies, the latter of which I hope will be granted
us, the former I am sure you will take care to regulate. - You will
have been informed of our Voyage to Rosetta by M ~ o l d s b o r o u g h
and Mf Severick, we are all well and anxiously wait your return. I
left your Trunk, Small Sword, dressing Case and Hat a t M! Petruchas,
and a Cask of Wine for M-~arquhar, which I hope is for Major Misset I am now sending him some small articles, but I think with you, we
shall never have it in our power to repay their civilites, however if
we cannot pay to them we must to somebody else. [NDA. Isaac Hull LB, 1803-1806.1

Concerning David Valenzin

Our readers will probably recollect a very interesting report made
during the session preceding the last, by the Committee of Claims, in
the case of the unfortunate David Valenzin. Some persons having
taken the liberty of representing that the committee were imposed
upon, and that the circumstances stated in their report were unfounded,
we publish the following letter from our distinguished countryman,
Mr. Eaton, to John C. Smith, esq. chairman of the Committee of
Claims, as substantiating those circumstances. For this publication
at this time we have another reason. It, in some small degree, throws
light on the character of Eaton, and evinces the sense entertained
abroad of a just government, that "rara awis in terris" cognitis.
GRAND
CAIRO,Dee. 26, 180.4.
SIR, This morning two Jewish merchants came, with essential oil of
roses for sale, to the British Resident's house, where I am. The were
dressed in the habit of Egypt. But one of them speaking rench
intelligibly, took my attention. I entered into an enquiry concerning
the actual state of commerce on this count , which naturally led him
to mention the names of sundry commercial'gouses here; among others,
that of Moses Valenzin. This name brought to my recollection the
unfortunate Valenzin, whose case last winter, so seriously occupied the
h n m i t t e e of Claims, and whose fate so justly moved their sensibility.
Engaged with the more immediate concerns, I do not know that my
thoughts had once before turned to those events since my departure
from America, But this accident induced particular enquiry; the
result of which I thought too interesting to pass unnoticed: wherefore,

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1804 TO 1806

c c t l l i lieut. OIBannon, Mr. Goldsborough, a purser in the navy, and
Mr. Farquhar, an English gentleman, into my appartment, I made the
examination hereafter transcribed, as attested by these gentlemen.
It corresponds so exactly with the account David Vdenzin gave of
himself, that it cannot, I am persuaded, be indifferent to you; especially as the justice of your report on that case, and consequent act of
Congress, have been the subject of comment in certain circles.
Enquiry made of a Jewish merchant in &and Cairo, touching the story of
David Valenzin.
What is your name?
"Leon Reubin."
Of what nation are you?
"A Hebrew."
Where were you born?
"In Leghorn, where my father is now estabIished."
How many years have you been in Egypt?
"Seven,"
Do you belong to any commercial house?
"To a house in Leghorn, by the fkm of -4bram Reuben, of which
I am the agent here."
Are you acquainted with the IIebrew mercantile houses in Alexandria?
"Yes; there are Lorca and Tilkey, the most considerable house;
Moses Valenzin, a respectable merchant, and others of less note."
Has Moses Valenzin any relations?
"He has a brother, David Valenzin, and an uncle."
Where is David Valenzin?
"David Valenzin came to Alexandria with a cargo of wine; sold it
to the commissary of the English Army; took a bill of exchange for
half the avails, and cash for the other half. But, as he had no correspondent in England, he went to Smlana and negotiated his bill
for merchandise; which he put on board a vessel for Malta. He departed from Malta for Tripoli; and, near Malta, we learn, was taken
by the Americans, who are a t war with the Bashaw of Tripoli; and
who have carried him-we h o w not where."
Do you know how Iong since David Valenzin was taken by the
hericans?
"No! I t is two years and a half, or three years, since he left
Egypt. I do not know how fong he remained in Smyrna: but it is
about twentv months since u7eheard he was taken."
Where w& David Valenzin born?
"David Valenzin was born in Venice, but came very young to T r i p
oli with his father, who was then a rich merchant."
Did Valenzin, the father, establish a house a t Tripoli?
"Yes."
Was the establishment, and was Valenzin under the protection of
the Bashaw of Tripoli?
"NO. Both his father and himself always wore hats,* and christian
habits-And hi brother, a t Alexandria, is now under the protection
of the imperial flag, as a subject of the Emperor."
Has David Valenzin any wife, or children?
"No; neither one nor the other: he was never married."
I have to inform you that David Valenzin is dead."How! Dead!"

219

WARS WITH BARBARY POWEBS

Yes. Impatient of the delay occasioned by want of documents in
his application for redress in the case of his capture; and, perhaps,
despairing of a successful decision; he put an end to his own existence
about ten months ago, in the Capitol of the United States.
"Is it possible!"
I saw him in his clotted blood.
"Alas; Valenzin!-Too unfortunate Valenzin!-He was but about
twenty-eight or twenty-nine years of age!"-Wept.
I have put these questions to you that I mi ht learn Valenzin's story;
and that we might be enabled to find out his awful heirs.
"I know not that he has any heirs except his brother a t
Alexandria."-Paused-"Or,
perhaps, he may have left a sister in
Tripoli; who must be very wretched."
You are at liberty to acquaint Moses Valenzin, of Alexandria, with
the particulars of these questions; and with the information thence
resulting. You may inform him also, that, the answem you have
given to my questions being established as the truth of facts, there
remain in deposit by the government of the United States, for the
heirs of David Valenzin, between one and two thousand Spanish
dollars; which will be transmitted to them by proper applicationto
said government; or to the administrator of said Valenzin's estate,
thus deposited, appointed at the City of Washington.

ATTESTATION

"The above examination was made b William Eaton, esq. in

1804, in presence of the under written."

RICH?FARQUHAR."
Leon Reuben knew not the object of my enquiry; nor could he possibly frame any conjecture concerning it, whatever imaginations
it may have exclted; for he thought he was all this time speaking mth
Englishmen. But on explaining myself to him, and lettin him
h o w that I had no other object in view than to find out the awful
heirs oi an unfortunate man, who had fallen a victim to the disasters
of war, in order that the wishes of my government may be accomplished in the restitution of his property, Leon seemed amazed-Turning towards his companion; raising his eyes to Heaven; and laying
both hands gravely to his breast, he exclaimed in Arabic, "Great God!
What an astonishing country that must be where the government takes
SO much pains to render justice to a Hebrew! Even a t this distance
to inform his heirs of cash in deposit, which might so easily have been
concealed!"
Certain1 the Jews are not accustomed, on this continent, to similar
testimonia s of national justice. The droit d' aubaine is very apt to
pffect them here, as it seldom fails to do rich sub'ects: indeed the right
1s frequently anticipated, or rendered timely y a friendly cup of
coffee.

This day standing in for Tripoli. I went to the bread room a t

At this instant I was caught by the nose by one of the most nauceous

the bread room were spoiled and I was fearfu they had ruined the
bread. He sent some hands to get the bags on deck and found not a

to examine, condemned 560 pounds, which left only enough for 3

I would write to you on the Subject, and your answer would determine
whether she should go or not. He said he wished to send some
money and other thing to some of our Officers, in Captivity s t Tripoli,
by whose friends he had been desired to send them. And Mr Hi gins
wishing to send Blankets for the men, and other articles which 8 a p t ~
Bainbridge had requested, this would afford a good op ortunity for
that purpose, and the Vessel would go from Tripoli to gruganza for
the Bullocks
Should you think proper to give permission for this Vessel to go to
Tripoli, care shall be taken to have a particular account of every
thing she takes from hence, and the Ins ection, which will be uni , prevent her tak@

SIR,I have been honoured with your letters of the 17th and 1gt@
Ins: the former of which however did not come to hand till last Evening - the Letter with the accompanying Packets came through the
hands of Major Misset some days past. - I had previous to receiving
them placed in the hands of Mess'? Briggs Brothers One Thousand
Dollars to meet your draft on them. - You inform me that most
likely you shall want four or five Thousand more - if so god lcnow~
where we shall get it, unless you have the means at Cairo or Rosetta,
for I know of none here, I am anxious to see you that we may make
arrangements for the passengers you say you shall have with you, for
it will be necessary to hire or purchase some other Vessel to carry them
in, as the Argus will not carry Provisions and Water for that Number
for any length of time, and I should suppose it would be proper to
make those arrangements before they are promised a passage for fear
we may disappoint them after they arim here. - I hope on your
arrival a t Rosetta you will send the Gentlemen forward as fast as
possible - The Purser is wanted and the other Gentlemen had
much better be on board than remain a t Rosetta, for I assure you
I am ashamed of receiving their Civilities without any chance of returning them, for they are too good. - I left with RIS Patrucha for
you a Trunk, dressing Case, Sword and Hat, and for Mr Farquhar a
Cask Wine, which I hope he intends for the Major. - Our friends
Messr"riggs are well and I assure you we spent a v e q merry Christmas with them, drinking success to your party &$ I pray you will make my respects to the Major and family And believe me your friend

ease remaining so long in a state of uncertitude, something worse than
suspence - hitherto I have received no Answer to any of my Letters
to Efamet Bashaw though besides the Special Couriers dispatched to
him from Alexandria and Rosetta, I have sent off expresses by different Routs since our arrival at Cairo - I am beginning to apprehend
that access to him is not so easy as I a t first irnmagined, yet am far
from admitting a doubt, of the h a 1 success of our expedition, Jealousy,
Suspicion, or perhaps self interest may have prevented the Mameluke
Beys from suffering the Letters to be delivered into his hands, or from
permitting him to separate himself from them - indeed it is not
impossible, that he himself after having been so repeatedly trifled with,
may entertain some doubt of our sincerrity. - If I get no intelligence from the Bashaw between this and Sunday Evening, I shall
dispatch M' Farquhar to you with this Letter and a small party of
recruits for the Bengaize expedition, to wait my arrival a t Alexandria shall remain here yet a few days, and if no intelligence comes from
the Bashaw, am inclined to think it will be best to mike an attempt
to pass both Armies, and seek an interview with him in person, it
would a t once do away dl doubts on his part, and remove any suspicions his friends the Beys may have conceived unfavourable to his
views - the undertaking will be hazrardous, but this is a world of
adventure, in which little is to be expected without enterprize and
perseverance, and not a great deal to be realized with them.
I
shall advise M' Goldsborough to profit of this occasion to return on
board the Brig,as I am persuaded you will need his services, and as
we can very well dispense with them. December 3Ots 9 P. M.
Mr Goldsborough and MT Farquhar have not appeared today, they
have had a Battle a t fisticuff last night a t a Billiard Table, and both
got Mack eyes, in consequence of which they have kept themselves
in Coventry - Good God! when will OW Young Men learn the weight
of respect which ought to attach itself to Uniform and a Sword, I t
were to have been wished that M? Goldsboroughs curiosity to see
Grand Cairo had been restramed, he has behaved disgracefully, and
very much to thf injury of the reputation of the cloth he wears - he
is accused of swmdlmg at-play at a Gentlemans board, of offering
indecencies to Turkish Ladles in the public Streeh, and what is sornewhat more base of bilking his Courtezan in a Brothel. - I certainly
should not mention these last two circumstances, were it not that
jomal Complaint of them as an znjury has been made to me, and a demand
of redress, which I with difficulty silenced - I n the Billiard Table
quarrel with Mr Farquhar, the spectators, who you may be sure were
numerous on so extraordinary occasion seem universally to think
Goldsborough the aggressor, in so much that if i t had not been for the
interference of Selim my .Janisary they would have suffered Farquhar
to break his Bones - hhzs shameful exhibition originated in a subject
equally shtuneful, a bet of half a pint of Rose Olio!!!It is matter of great exultation to the Turks, and I confess I am
mortified with regret that an incident so unfavorable to American
&am.cter has happened a t our first introduction to this Capitol.
I do not give you h s information to be used in law Martial, but only
that you may be e%bled to udge of Proper Characters, where to
grant indulgencies, in Order t a t your own feelings may not suffer
mortification - I do not know how the Gentlemen of his rank will

HARBOUR
OF LISBON
Decemf SO. 1804

SIR I have the Honor to make known to you that I arrived here
the day before yesterday (last from Syracuse) after one of the most
Tedious 8: disagreeable passages I ever Experienced - I call'd at
Gibraltar & Tangier, but at the former was prevented from having
any communication, owing to the Plague not having yet subsided. At Tangier I had Verbal communication with M: Simpson (altho
my Boat was not permitted to land, nor he to come on board a11
Vessels being subject to quarantine) and informed by him that every
thing stood perfectly well in that quarter - I pass'd Tangier on the
19tQInst & from the moment I got fairly into the Atlantic, until my
arrival here, I had one continued Gale from the Westward, & this
under the unpleasant circumstance, during the most Violent part of
the Gale, of being obliged to carry a press of Sail, to avoid the dreadful
consequences of being cast away on the Moorish Coast, with a Bowsprit so bad1 sprung as to prevent carrying any Sail on it, and our
principal Sa' s so indifferent that they were not equal to withstand
the Violence of the Wind: In this situation we were unbending,
four Days. - I was
mending, bending and reunbending &"or
perfectly decieved in the Bowsprit, for when I took charge of the ship,
I was informed that it had been supposed defective, but that it had
been examined, repaired & afterwards considered perfectly secure;
however the third Day after I left Syracuse, I met with a fresh Gale
from the Westward, which convinced me to the contrary, as it was
with difticulty I t could be secured sufficiently to support the Foremast. - The Constifution is the most laboursome & uneasy Ship I
have ever commanded, but this I concieve is owing to her Kentlidge
being improperly stowed. - I am a t present in Quarantine and
have not as yet heard from our Consul, altho in sight of his residence;
however I am in hopes that this apparent neglect is owing to some
primary cause, such as ought not to detract from his merits in his
OfEcial Capacity. The flattering accounts that Mr Jarvis gave Cap! [James] Rarron,
when the Essexwas here about two months ago, of his being able to procure any number of Seamen the Squadron might want, induced Commo'
Barron to send the Constitution to this Port to complete her crew,
which is about 80 short of Complement, in preference to any other,
and a t the same time shew-the Emperor of Morocco that our ships
are in motion, as you will discover by his Letter of Instructions to me
on the subject. - The Constitution is in want of a new Bower Cable
& owing to the severe Buffeting she met with on her passage, will
require three new Topsails, a new Foresail & Mainsail & Bowsprit if
it can be procured; however I am in hopes no time will be lost by thesz
outfits, as they can be executed in the necessary time it will take to
procure the Seamen that are wanted. I understand by the Pilot that the Brig Siren (which has been
since Commo: Barrons command on the Gibraltar station) left this

~r

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS

227

place n few days ago: her destination I suppose Tangier, where I
left orders (by instruction of Commo. Barron) for her to proceed to
join the Squadron Aloft, in case Mr Simpson was of opinion that her
services could be dispensed with in that uarter. - I have not as
yet learnt the destruction that the last Ga e has caused on the Coast
of Spain, between Cape St Vincent & the Entrance of the Straights
& on the Atlantic coast of Morocco, but I am too well satisfy'd that
it is very considerable; An American Brig is this moment coming in
with the loss of her Bowsprit, Foremast & Main Topgallant mast,
with her Decks cleared of Boats & every other movable.
The Brig Scourge Cap! Prebles Prize, pass'd through the Gut the
Evening before I did and altho she had got a good offing I am afraid she
suffered very considerably. As the John Adams sailed fromaSyracuseon tho 16 Nov: for America, 12 days before me, she will u7~thoutany doubt have arrived long
before this reaches you; I am therefore prevented from saying an thing on the subject of Pass'd or Future opperations against l'ripo$,
further than you have a right to Expect that next Summer will complete Every thing perfectly conforma[ble] wit11 your wishes - I
have nothing further to add than that you may rely on Every Exertion
by me being used to rejoin the Squadron as soon as possible. -

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS

That the captors mi ht, if not peremptorily enjoined to the contrssg by their orders, Eave brought off their prize, and reaped the
pecuniary reward designed them by the law is a matter of the highest
probability; and approximates certainty as near as any unaccomplished event can do. They found her com letely equipped and fitted
for sea, and prepared for action even to the oading of her guns. After
all the time spent in the action, in preparations to execute the order
for the destruction of the ship; in the effectual application of the means
of destruction, accordmg to the details of the order; and in waiting to
see the pro ess and effect of the same, and to repel the apprehended
attempts o the enemy to retake the ship, before her destruction had
been placed beyond doubt; after all this lapse of time, the captors
effected their retreat, in their own vessel, without the loss of a man.
I apprehend that the means and the chances of escape in the captured frigate, were incalculably greater and more certain, if the captors had been a t liberty to cut her cables and hoist sail, the instant
they had mastered her decks. Two obstacles were to be apprehended
and guarded against, whether they retreated in their oum vessel, or in
the prize: recapture and impediments of navigation. Against the
first, the superior means of defence in the fri ate are too obvious to
be insisted on; and I take it for granted, that er facilities as a sailer,
the depth of water, and other circumstances, must have opened her
way to the sea, at least as safe and speedy as that of the ketch Intrepid.
But the time which would thus have been gained, must be held conclusive. The advantage it would have given the captors is incalculable; and even if i t were possible to suppose that the intrinsic difEculties opposing their egress in the frigate, were greater than what
they encountered in the ketch, (an hypothesis deemed wholly inadmissible,) still the advantage of time must more than have compensated them. Commodore Preble framed his order when a t a eat distance from the scene of action; and, reasoning from probab ties and
circumstances in general, he inferred that the enterprise, even to the
extent of talrin and destro g the frigate, would have been attended
with more di culty and oss than actually occurred. He did not
anticipate the consequences, to their full extent, of the panic terror
with which the suddenness of the attack, and the heroic bearing of
the assailants, struck the enemy; he probably anticipated desperate
resistance, and a, serious sacrifice of life. It was obviously impossible
for him, a t that distance, to judge of the actual state and condition
of the frigate, or of the existing means and facilities for bringing her
off; which must have depended on contingencies which he had no possible means of ascertaining; such as the losses to be sustained by the
assailants in carrying her; the state of her equipment for defence or
for sailing; of the mnd, weather, &c. Her destrucbon, b so wellplanned and daring an enterprise, was deservedly considere as of the
utmost importance to the operations then going on against Tnpoli;
as well from its moral effect upon the enemy, as the abstraction of so
much of his positive force. This great ob'ect, the Commodore concluded from the facts and circumstances t en known to him, would
have been put in too much hazard, by an attempt to push the .enterprise to the point of still more signal and glorious success, by bnngmg
off the prize in the face of the enemy. But it turned out, in the event,
that this would have been far the safer and easier achievement. It is
understood, indeed, to be the opinion of the moat experienced and

skilful naval commanders, that if Commodore Preble had conducted
the enterprise in person, he would, upon the s ot, and with a full view
of all the circumstances, have changed his p an, and brought off the
frigate. This is well known to have been the decided and clear opinion of the illustrious commander, who first suggested, and then executed, the enterprise with so much glory and advanta e to himself and
his country. 'Tis well known that while he faithfu y andpunctually
fulfilled the orders of his superior in command, he would gladly have
followed the bent of his own genius, by taking the course pointed out
by the circumstances and the event of the action.
As to one of the questions which have been suggested in this case,
whether the captors acquire a beneficial property and interest in a
maritime prize of war, before adjudication, I have, on a former occasion,
been called upon to give i t full consideration; and the opinion then
expressed, and the reasons advanced in the affirmative, I yet adhere
to, with a coddence corroborated by the success with which they
were maintained before a tribunal of pre-eminent learning and talent.

[NR&L. PamphIet File.]

[December 18041
Statement of 116. M. Noah, late U. 6. Consul, Tripoli

The memorial of Mrs. Decatur to Congress, praying for herself ana
the captors of the Philadelphia frigate, that the value of said frigate
may be paid, has excited considerable surprise in the country. I t
was not for a moment supposed, that amidst the gratuities, pensions,
and appropriations for services rendered during the revolutionary and
late wars, that a debt of so high and important character was still
unpaid by the nation. There appears, however, to be but one voice
on the subject, viz., that the same justice and liberality which has
been awarded to others, should in this case cancel a claim which has
slept too long.
The Mediterranean was the made of the American navy. Its
character and discipline -its subsequent success in war- its i d u e n w
in peace, and its present high character throughout the world, have
their origin in the wars declared against the several powers on the
Barbary coast; and in that school of fierce contention and ultimate
glory were the Hulls, Bainbridges, and Decaturs - the Perrys, Lawrences, McDonoughs, Joneses, and the galaxy of naval heroes, taught
to fi h t and conquer. It is not, therefore, surprisin that the nation
sho d be anxiously alive to the discussion of any c aim arising from
services rendered in that remote quarter of the world.
Having passed some time on the Barbary coast in the public service,
it became necessary to make myself familiar with the relations between the United States and those regencies, not only from their
commencement, but to trace their history, the treaties, tributes, and
diplomatic intercourse, as well as the wars, which finally established
the independence of our flag on the coast of Africa.
Our difficulties first commenced with Tripoli - with the ~ a c h a ~ o f
which kingdom, as well as the other States, we had some indefimte
arrangements; and for some time prior to the appearance of a naval

3

f

WARS WITH BARARY POWERS

233

force in the Mediterranean, our merchant vessels and seamen were
protected by the British, Swedish, and such friendly powers, who had
for many years treaties with the Barbary States, aided by occasional
donations and tributes; which were considered advisable in preference
to war, a t a period when the naval force of the country was too limited
for a hazardous experiment, and when the formidable strength and
atrocious piracies of the Barbary corsairs paralyzed the efforts of the
Christian powers.
As the commerce of the United States increased in the Mediterranean, the friendly interference of European powers in our behalf was
considerably diminished, and i t is not uncharitable to believe, that
commercial rivalry first suggested to the Pacha of Tripoli to demand a
considerable and perpetual tribute, or give us the alternative of war,
either of which was not a t that period desirable.
The capture of several of our vessels, and the consequent slavery of
our citizens, roused the people to a sense of their wrongs, and war was
formally declared against the Pacha of Tripoli; and our disposable
force was sent to the Mediterranean, with all the young officers, including Decatur, who have subsequently perpetuated the glory and
triumphs of the American flag.
This war with Tripoli was of vital importance to a nation having
an infant navy, and desirous of establishing a name and a character
among the governments of the earth. It was not simply to chastise
an African pirate and abolish tribute - i t was to secure forever to
the American flag that freedom which it claimed, and to which it
was every where preeminently entitled.
The nation, therefore, in tracing the triumphs, the disci line, and
i,
high character of the American navy to the war with ~ r i ~ o fcannot
avoid being grateful to all who distinguished themselves in that
memorable contest, and to reward with honor and profit those who
achieved important victories.
The war a t its commencement, and for two years, dragged heavil ,
without any of those animating results which the people fond y
anticipated. I t was a dull routine of blockade, costly, unpropitious
and discouraging - occasional proofs of valor and seamanship were
discernible - jealousies and bickerings broke out among semor
officers,who, far removed from their government, were compelled to
exercise discretionary powers - the expense of the war was not unfelt,
and taking the unpromising state of things into consideration, the
Government of the United States did contemplate st one period
proposing such terms of peace and payment of a small tribute, which
several of the European powers then complied with- and the unfortunate capture of the Philadelphia frigate, and long captivity of her
officersand crew, did not tend to inspirit the nation to a further and
more active prosecution of the war. The circumstances attending
the capture of that vessel are well known.
The Philadelphia frigate, commanded by Captain Bainbridge, in
sailing close to the town, struck on a rock, and became stationary,
under the powerful batteries of the citadel. A brisk fire between each
was sustained for several hours, until the tide falling, the ship settled,
and her gunwales were under the water, and the captain,. o5cers,
and three hundred men, became prisoners of war. The Tripohtans
to* possession of the ship, warped her a t high tide from the rocks,
moored her under the castles, with the crescent waving over the star-

7

234

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1804 TO 1806

spangled banner, while the crew were carried captives to the dungeons,
to undergo the most painful suffering.
I t was at this juncture, when the ship was in possession of the enemy,
and under the protection of several hundred pieces of ordinance
frowning from the battlements, that Decatur and a handful of brave
men, in a little xebeque, disguised as fishermen, fastened themselves
to the frigate, sprang on board, and after a fierce and bloody encounter
with the "maligant and turban'd Turk," on the quarter-deck, carried
her a t all points, drove the Turks into the sea, tore down the crimson
flag, fired her in several parts, and took to their little fishing smack and
sailed off triumphantly, regarding a t a distance the sublime spectacle
of the crackling flames illuminating the crescents of the mosques, and
the turretsof the castles - the blaze of artillery from the ernbrazures the blowing up of the ship - the shrieks of the dying, and the imprecations of the Turkish soldiery together, "making night hideous."
I t has been said that Decatur, after recapturing the frigate, could
not have brought her out; and in reply to that charge, it is said that
hi orders were positive to burn her. Burning her to the u-ater's edge
was calculated to make a more deep and appalling impression upon the
Musselmen then merely carrying away the ship; and this spirited act
of Decatur's, while it reflected the highest honor on hi courage, was
loudly applauded throughout Europc, and infused new hopes in the
nation, while it created on the part of the Pacha a higher respect for
our national capacities and resources, and compelled him to propose
terms of peace.
The results of this extraordinary attempt were of incalculable
advantage to the nation; they led to an honorable peace - to the
abolishment of tribute - to the liberation of the suffering captives to future peace and honor -to a grtllant, ambitious spirit in the navyto an increasing popularity in that branch of our defence - to a strict
discipline, and all of which were productive of future and ermsnent
glory in the war with the greatest naval power of the wor d. These
consequences go far to strengthen a claim which is in itself unquestionable, and would be recognized by all well organized and just governments.
The war with Algiers in 1815 was declared upon the same principle,
and prosecuted with the same views as the former one with Tripoli;
but the Algerines were a much more formidable power, possessing a
stronger navy, and fortifications almost impregnable, oi a hiih, audacious, and unsubduable spirit. The command of the squadron was
ven to Decatur, from the settled conviction *at his name was more
l i l i a r to the Barbsry States, in consequence of hie exploits befofe
Tripoli, and in this idea the Government was not mistaken. I was ln
that neighborhood during the Algerine war, and it is a fact unparalleled in history, and almmt inconceivable in the annals of warfare,
that injfty days after fhe squadron sailed from Sandy Hook, a treaty
of peace was signed between Algiers and the United States, which
included indemnification.for the past and security*fort h f d u r e . I n that
short space of time Decatur had arrived in the Mediterranean, fought
and capture+ a .frigate, and some small vessels, killed the Algenne
Admiral, sslled mto the ha~borof Algiers, and r&iJ;ed the treaty at the
cannon's mouth.
I t was not expected that our differences with Algiers would t e ~ i nate without delay, bloodshed, and cost. The nation was determined

f'

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS

235

to abolish tribute and punish the barbarians a t every sacrifice,
but the name of Decatur, the promptness of his movements, and his
success on the threshold of the contest, saved a large sum to the Government, the loss probably of valuable lives, and secured additional
honor and freedom to our flag.
Here was the harvest of that fame and national honor which &st
sprang up a t Tripoli. From Algiers, the squadron sailed for Tunis,
where a gross Infraction of the treaty had been committed, and nearly
$50,000 of American property had been cut out by the British. We
were on the spot at the time, and perceived the effect of the same
influence. "Tell your Admiral to come ashore and see me," said the
Bey. "He declines coming, your highness, until these disputes are
settled, which are best done on board ship." "But this is not treating
me with becoming dignity; Hamuda Pacha, of blessed memory,
commanded them to land and wait a t the palace until he pleased to
receive them." "Very likely,. your highness, but that was twenty
years ago." "I know this adrnlral, he is the same one who, in the war
with Sidi Yusef, of Trablis, burnt the frigate." "The same." "Hum!
why do they send wild young men to treat for peace with old powers?
Then you Americans don't speak truth - you went to war with England, a nation with a great fleet, and said you took their frigates in
equal Â£ight - an honest people always speak truth." "Mrell, sir, and
that was true. Do you see that tall ship in the bay, with a blue flag?
(the h r r i e r e ) that one was taken from the British; that one near
the small island, (the Macedcnian,) was also captured on equal terms;
that sloop near Cape Carthage, (the Peacock,) was also takenin battle."
The Bey laid down the telescope, reposed on his cushions, and with a
small tortoise-shell comb, set with diamonds, combed his beard.
A small vessel got under weigh, and came near the batteries; a pinnance with a few men rowed about the harbor, and one person,
dressed in the garb of a sailor, was taking soundings - it was Decatur.
"Tell the Admlral to land," said the Bey, "and all shall be settled to
his satisfaction," which was done.
From Tunis Decatur went into Tripoli with the squadron, where
di5culties had also arisen. These were soon and satisfactorily settled,
and the old Pacha received in the most friendly manner the commander
of the squadron, who, when a young man, had destroyed his frigate,
and bearded him under his very batteries.
I t is. however, unnecessary to recapitulate the naval triumphs of our
flag in the Mediterranean; they are known, duly appreciated, and are
sources of great and honest pride; they have procured us indemnity
for the past and security for the future, and probably no officer has
done more to bring about the desirable state of things than Commodore
Decatur.
Whilst these facts are every where admitted, and whilst the nation
is disposed to pay the debt of gratitude due to a deceased gallant
officer, the question a t present relates to indemnity for destroying
the Philadelphia frigate.
I am not apprised of the nature of the objections to the claim, if
any objections are made. I can only say that the nation has derived
a greater benefit from the destruction of the Philadelphia frigate,
than from the possession of the frigate itself. She had been captured,
and was in possession of the enem , and was recaptured and
destroyed - the claim is therefore lega and equitable, and loses none

9

236

NAVAL OPERATIOOVSFROM 1804 TO 1805

of its force from its not having been heretofore liquidated. I t .is a
claim that the nation recognises, and is bound in honor to pay, and
one that the American people, I am persuaded, d feel a pleasure in
adjusting to the satisfaction of the representative of Commodore
Decatur, and the gallant crew who fought and conquered under him.

[December 18041
Conaerning reward for destruction of ex-U. S. Frigate Philadelphia

Mr. Jarvis's report to the House of Representatives, January 27, 1836.
The Committee on Naval Mairs, to which was referred the petition
of the legal representatives of Edward Preble, James Lawrence,
Joseph Bainbridge, and Thomas Macdonough, in behalf of themselves and others, the survivors and legal representatives of the
officers and crew of the ketch Intrepid, under the command of
Capt. Stephen Decatur, at the time of the destruction of the
frigate Philadelphia, in the harbor of Tripoli, on the night of the
16th of February, 1804, Report:
That the subject of awarding a recompense to the officers and crew
of the ketch Intrepid, for the gallantry of the daring exploit in which
they were so successfuly engaged, has been under the consideration
of every Congress since the year 1824. Every committee to which
it has been referred has made a favorable report; and the House of
Representatives, under all the changes to which it is liable, has
appeared to be invariably impressed with the justice and merit of
the claim. The obstacle which has hitherto prevented a satisfactory
decision, has been a difTerence of opinion upon the mode of apportioning the reward, to which it has always been conceded that the
participants in that achievement were entitled. The want of success
of their predecessors, shall not restrain the committee from using
their endeavors to frame a bill which may find acceptance with s
majority of the House.
It would be superfluous to offer a detailed statement of the destruction of the frigate Pldadelphia. Every fact connected with this bold
attempt is too well known to the nation to need recapitulation. I t is
sufficient to say, that no deed of adventurous daring or successful
enterprise in our naval annals, teeming as they do with brilliant
exploits, deserves more exalted praise or more ample reward; and yet
it stands alone in being denied the meed which an admiring and
grateful country in every other instance, has been eager to bestow.
The statement annexed to this report will show that, not only when
vessels were destroyed, but even when they were recaptured, Congress
has not hesitated to decree a large pecuniary reward; and, when we
consider the lapse of time between the action and the reward, in the

237

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS

present instance, the sums which have been appropriated are proportionably greater than that of which it is the purpose of the oommittee to urge the grant, and which is the same heretofore recommended. I n providing for the distribution, it has been deemed sdvisable to follow neither the bill reported at the second session of the
19th Congress, which was framed in conformity with the prize act,
nor the bill of the last Congress, which was founded upon an ingenious
but arbitrary allotment. The distribution recommended by the
committee is founded upon the relative proportion of the pay of the
officers and seamen of the navy, according to the pay bill adopted
at the last session of Congress. This is considered to be as equitable
and reasonable a mode as can be devised, and its adoption will remove
the objection of the great ine uality in favor of the commanding
officer, which was made to the b' reported to the last Congress, while
it avoids too great an increase in the value of the shares in the lower
class of distribution, arising from the small number of persons to be
found in them, which was the objection made to adopting the provisions of the prize act. The tabular statement, annexed to this
report, will explain the operation of the principle adopted for the
distribution, in conformity to which a bill is reported, and will furnish
the means of instituting a comparison between the several plans of
apportionment.

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1804 T O 1805

[January 18051
To Secretary of the Navy from Captain William Bainbridge, U. 6. navy
NAVYYARD,
WASHINGTON
9btQFebry 1809
SIR,Havin by chance last evening met with a volume entitled
"Horrors of S avery" written by one William Ray, who was a private
on board the frigate Philadelphia under my command, and perceiving, by the volume, that documents were furnished him by the Navy
Department, I presume the work has come to your hands. Altho I
do not deem it necessary for my reputation to enter into a paper controversy n-ith an ungrateful wretch who has no chrtracter to loose,

SIR,I am engaged in prefering for publication, a volume containing

an account of our unfortunate captivity in Tripoli. I t is to be published by subscription, 8: I wish to make it as useful & interesting
to the public as possible, and as you have ever manifested a generous,
ready, and cheerful disposition to grant me any favor in your power I have ventured to solicit your patronage & furtherance of the undertaking, by forwarding to me such as you may deem important art,icIes,
documents or communications & such as you can with convenient
propriety impart without any trouble or detriment to yourself
I have just received a letter from Genl Eaton, in which he promises
to furnish me with all necessary information of his operations on the
Barbary coast, and assures me in very friendly & flattering terms of
his aid in & support of the work. I have also very good encouragement
from gentlemen of means 8: respectability - A subscription will
soon be opened and if you think proper, I will send you one - but as
I was uncertain where you were, I thought best to m i t e to you first
& to receive an answer - which I wish you to send me as speedy as
convenient, that I may know the better how to calculate, and in the
condition specify the contents, size & price of the book
I am now a t home with my friends & although I am under the
dominion of that imperio* tyrant Poverty, am free from the tyrants
of a more sanguinav & trouble nature and though I have the misfortune of a severe sickness, and have been deprived by a hurt of the
temporary use of my write hand - by a comparative estimateofmy
past sufferings m t h my present circumstances - I derive a large ballance of contentment m my favor - and find myself - I can imperfectly express myself why, more real happy than ever I was in my
life - sucb is the salutary use 8: benefit of adversity, if properly
applied - and I sincerely hope that it has had the same effect on
yourself, and that you may increase in public honors & domestic
felicity through the various walks of life

Remarks on the preceding letter,
It came to my House when I was absent from the United States on my return home, I did not answer it, which I presume is the cause
of the malice & falsehoods exhibited against me in the "Horrors of
Slavery". I had rendered the author of that infamous work, all the
services in my power while he was under my immediate command,
and after he left me, I obtained for him a Clerkship on board of one
of our Frigates (which increased his pay from $6 to $25 per month)
At the period of writing the foregoing letter, no doubt he felt the
sentiment towards me which he expresses therein - and which he
could not have done had he believed what he has since published I can therefore attribute the change, only to disappointment to an
ungrateful heart & unprincipled mind
Wq B
He has accused me of a total disregard and dereliction of the unfortunate Crew in Tripoli - The following letters written by Ray
himself, for the Crew, and which beyond doubt expressed hm own
sentiments at that time - will fully rove his falsehoods on that point
a,nd how unworthy of oredit his pubication is - I have many other
letters which passed between the Crew and myself during our imprisonment and which equally proves my great attention to them &
their warm acknowledgements. To hi infamous lies relative to the
surrender of the Ship - I appeal to the mass of evidence examined
on the court of inquiry. And to the authors own contradiction in
his relation of that unhappy event.

SIR AS a11 hopes of release for the present are vanished it is our
unanimous wish provided it is in your power, that you would grant
or procure us a trifling sum of money in daily allowances. There
are not any of us paid for our work as heretofore. And the two small
black loaves and scanty allow-ance of 02 are scarcely sufticient to afford
us subsistence
We are fully persuaded Sir, that did you know our wants, you would
do every thing in your power to relieve them
We are totally ignorant of your pecuniary resources, and would
not by any means willingly trouble you with vain and unreasonable
requests, for it is not in your power to assist us we must patiently

I am sorry to learn that any change should have taken place in

from the pangs of hunger. You will recollect, that the allowance of

stopped
I n respect to our solicitation for an advance of money to procure
yourself daily a owance of Provissions. I have to observe, that the
confined situation in which I am kept detached from all communication with you, & many other strong reasons prevent a compliance
with your request. Altho our funds in this place are but small and
intended for the subsistence of the Officers (who are not allowed any
support whatever from this Government) I feel every disposition to
relieve your necessary wants as much as lays within my power,
And if you will let me know what additional quantity of bread,
you are daily in need of - I will give orders to have it sent to your
prison and if you wish, I will have fresh meat sent twice a week or
oftener if our finances will admit of it - Let me hear from you on

SIR. I have the honor of your letter of the 26 June informing me
of five ships of war being further sent into the Mediterranean.
I hare now the honor to inclose you the report of Vessels belonging to the United States arrived in this district, for the last twelve
months in future, this report shall be forviarded to you every six
months agreeably to your instructions.
The Gnited States Schooner Enterprize, Captain Robinson has
been ordered up to this district by the Commodore to repair and
permission has been obtained that she enterns [interns] into the
Arsenal a t Venice, and for her wants receires the Government Stores
at a fair and e uivalent valuation, the Austrian Government in this
instance as we 1 as all others, have shewn a friendly disposition
ton7ards the U. States; - it d l occur to the Secretary, that this
is the first Vessel of TI-ar of the U: S: that has ever entered into the
Ports of the Bdriatic.
Strict regard has bitherto been paid by this Government to a
ri id system of neutrality that it does not appear their is any probabfity of their entering into a Continental TTTnr a t the same time i t
may be proper to remark that considerable revieu7s of troops are
intended this Spring in the Ex Venetion territory, and at which the
Emperor himself is expected to assist.
The Emperor of germ an^ has declared himself hereditary Emperor
of Austria, by public proclanlation throughout all his hereditary
dominions, t h s new Title has been acknowledged by most of the
Por~ersof Europe, and their Diplomatic relations renewed accordingly.
I have some intentions of appointing s Vice Consul at Venice,
the probability is our intercourse with that City wd1 never be. of any
consequence, it's Commerce being restricted by duties, while thls
remairis a free port; but as our Smaller Ships of T a r , whilst in the
Mediterranean may perhaps Occasionall come up for repairs, it
becomes then desirable to hare an offici person to address; in the
instance of the Enterprize I sent my Vice Consul with Captaln RobmEon to render any assistance that the service might require; on future
occasions I could act in a similar manner, though if I meet.w~tha
person that I conceive adaptcd for the situation, I shall appomt hlm
to the Office
This city enjoys & has enjoyed a perfect system of health, and the
most ri orous measures are pursued to prevent the introduction of
the Iv1afadY which has during the Autumn infested the ports of the

under the Goverrlment of the United States should so far have overstepped the bounds of civility as to m i t e such a letter upon such slight
&: suppositious grounds to an Officer holding a respectable Station
under the same Government. Did I want any other incitement than
a desire to be of service to my Country to release you from your
unpleasant situation, it, certainly would not be produced by the expressions I\-luch you have been pleased to make use of. Your threat of
cornpIaint to Government might alarm me had I the smallest apprehension that they were disposed to censure as precipitately & with as
Iiltle examination as your letter indicates that you are: as for this
purpose you have either intentionally or by mistake mis-stated facts
that in part no person can be better acquainted with than yourself.
Your first letter is dated the 2gt4 ultimo in which you say you arrived
the last night, which leaves at a fair computation only three days to
the date of your second viz from saturday morning to tuesday morning
(probably) sunday afternoon it was brought to my House, but not
being at home did not receive it till the night & early on Tuesday
Morning I replied to it &- sent the Beef &- Vegetables you required.
I also desired the Vice Consul on saturday to go to Paqo d Arcos, to
know what was wanted, but the weather bein bad he could not go
till sunday where he got by 8 o'clock a. m.; so t at you have not been
personally neglected, much less the interest of my Country. But as
I cannot be persuaded that the interest of our Country, which you say
has caused your warmth will be promoted by a misunderstanding
between its officers, I certainly shall not court a diierence with you,
at the same time shall leave you the most unlimitted permission to act
as you think proper. RIy letter of yesterday anticipates a reply to
what relates to the quarantine -

Lisbon Sr'+Jan.uary1804 [5]
SIR Your second letter of the lac Instant I received yesterday
evening & least my omitting to notice cvery paragraph may be distorted into a subject of offense, I shall go into some detail in my
answer; but as I have not lately read the elegant irony of Dean
Swift, nor the more finished invective of Junius, I hope that I shall
be excused if in animadverting on your two letters, I should descend
from the dignity of the officialstyle to the lower walks of Billingsgate.
Not being deeply conversant in the traditional history of "Consular Administrations" for I beleive our Country does not afford a
written history (which is very astonishing when we come to recollect

250

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1804 TO 1806

the immense importance it is to the world to know whether a Consul
went three leagues to visit a frigate on the day of her arrival or whether
he did not go at all, or whether he answered a letter received from
the Commander the next day or the next day but one) I cannot say
whether my conduct is unprecedented or not; but this I can say that
I am perfectly satisfied of the propriety of it, as it relates to the Frigate under your command.
It should seem somewhat singular that what you should p l ~ a s eto
term "my neglect" should have involved you in any embarrassment,
when in your f i s t letter you say you have "some knowledge of the
rigid quarantine laws of this place", as such I should have supposed
that you must at least have expected fifteen or twentp days quarantine & made your arrangements accordingly. ,4s to the propriety of
your quarantine I must be silent; the Government of this as well as
of all other Countries taking the liberty to think and arrange on
this point as they may deem the most conducive to the health of the
inhabitants, .ct-ithout consulting the foreign Agents resident in the
Country but presume you cannot have any very great reason for
complaint; if you are not detained longer than the British & other
vessels of War under similar circumstances. Quarantines being mere
memures of precaution to prevent the introduction of dangerous disorders, I cannot perceive that Vessels of War ought to be exempted
from a scrutiny as strict rts what Merchantmen are subjected to; and
I confess myself so blind as not to be aware that any "disgrace" is
attached to our Il-ational character or to our officers from submitting
to such investigation when it is a general custom. I n asking for this
information I only requested such as1 thought would be the most likely
to get the frigate released the soonest, if satisfactory; and if in my
haste I put a question that a reference to your first letter would have
solved; vizg the day of your sailing for I think that is the only circumstance you minutely informed me of, it was not a very heinous subject
of offence; nor without the greatest Fiolence to language couid it be
twisted to mean that I insinuated that you come here "to sell a Cargo"
or "to ask any favours of the Portuguese Government". I t is a subject
of much mortification to me that you have come so great a distance,
as I hope my language will not be deemed too strong, when I say,
your precipitate & unjustifiable n~arrnt,hand I think determination,
is likely to deprive the service of the benefit that would probabh
have resulted from a more temperate line of conduct; and I shall
leave i t to yourself, to calculate the consequences that are likely to
ensue from it.
After adverting to the several parts of your letters that are most
exceptionable, if any one part is more so than the other, allow me to
express my surprise a t the liberty you have taken to m i t e in such a
style to an Officer with whoh you are totally unacquainted, bearing
a Commission under the same Government, as respectable at least q.s
the one you hold; and was I not apprehensive that you would set ~t
down as the vaunting of a vain man I should ask leave to add, to an
Officer who has rendered as much service to his Countr in his Station
as he beleives you have done in yours. But i t is possi Ie I may hayc
put a wrong construction on your moaning from the want of an intimate knowledge of the Marine Style and that it mny only be intended
as a burlesque on the compliments of the season.
The preceding remarks I hope ou will consider as from M' Jarvis
of Boston to Captain Rodgers of altimore & as growing out of your

g

letters; & as a correspondence of crimination & recrimination is exceedingly disagreeable to me & must be to every Man of sentiment
and feeling, and as I do not think a &spute between two officers under
the same Government in a foreign Country adds to y' consequence or
redounds to their honor, I hope that it will terminate here, and what
letters the service of our Country requires should pass between us may
at least be couched in terms of civility. To set you the example,
what foUows will be written in trhe style that 1 think a Consul of the
United States ought to address the Commander of an American
Rigate.I am very sorry to learn from your letters of the 1" Instant, that
you are so circumscribed as to time; and I a litt<lewonder a t it when
james Barron Esquire must have supposed there was not much
chance of your getting Prattic under twenty days; but you may rest
assured that I shall not fail to exert myself to the utmost of my power
to get you released so soon as possible. I cannot think that even if
you are to be detained twenty days that the service will be benefited
by your sailing for Gibratter, in preference to waiting, as that bay
certainly not being so safe as where you now lay, as the Men that are
required & which is the principal object of your visit, I conceive cannot be had there; and rtltho: the prospect of immense gain has enticed
most of the unempIoyed seamen into the British Service, yet unquestionably some may be had here; and as to what repairs the Frigate
wants, if I am not much deceived, they can be made here a t a lower
rate & with more safety b convenience than a t Gibralter, and with as
much expedition. The stores she may want can also be had as cheap
or cheaper. Taking all these circumstances into consideration I
should suppose unless your orders are peremptory, that i t would be
the most adviseable for you not to leave the Port until you have accomplished your object; especially a t this season of the year whenso
heavy a ship can not be eminently useful in the Strelghts; I imagine
not near so much so to the service as would be the seamen the next
Spring 8: Summer, that may be picked up here. However should you
determine to leave here in the twenty days & will trust to the makin
the Bowsprit & sails on shore; if you will send me the measures,
will engage them to be done at once, or if you wish to give any directions I m i l l desire the Carpenters 4% Sail Makers to go to Pago dfArcos
for the purpose. The Cable & Anchor can also be sent down. Will.
you let me know on what terms $ for what time the seamen are to
be engaged? m?lat you wish you d l please to inform me of as your
occasions may require.
The memorandum sent down was the particulars of the Beef &
Vegetables, which was done to prevent any embezzlement on the part
of the boatmen.

with due difference to your opinion be permitted to address you in
that Language which I consider incumbent -on the Cap5 of a X l a n of
War to a Consul who has so far forgot his Duty or neglected the
the Interest of his Country, as to suffer the Ship he commands to
remain unattended to, Even one Hour after her arrival, without
some primary cause, & that too without the Consuls arrogating to
himself the right of directing the movements of the Squadron to
which he belongs, or Even the Ship he commands - and before
we enter into the Business of the Ships wants &$, I must be permitted
to intrude farther; By observing that it is of so little come uence
to me whether you hare read "Dean Swift" or "Junius", or w ether
you are h!ir Jarvis of BOSTONor J2' Jarvis of SAVANNAH, but as I
consider you the Consul of the U. States, I must beg leave to assure
you, that you shall not only be accountable to your Goverment

SIR, I have been honoured with your Letter by hi17 Farquhar, trho
has this moment arrived with 1.l:Goldsborough and the party. I
must confess I am very anxious to leave this, and was in hopes of having the pleasure of seeing you with them, in fact nothing prevented
my writing to you a t Cairo, but the probability of your leaving t.here
before my Letters woug arrive. - I am unhappy that appearances
are so much against our getting information from the Bashaw, as we
have been here so long, and not able to gain the least intelligence from
h i - I fear that something stands in the way, that we are not
acquainted with, and I expect we will find that to be the case - In
fact I am led to belie~ethat French interest is the cause. - I shall
send this by express, and should you not learn anything further, by
the time you receive it, I should suppose it would be either proper to
abandon the expedition, and get from this as soon as possible, or for
you to remain here, and the Argus to return with such information
as you may have for the Commodore, what your prospects of success
are &v which will enable him to furnish you with every thing proper
for the Expedition, and give us such assistance as he may think necesTaV. -. At aU events it is time to determine on something, for ~t
1s lmposslble for us to remain here long, and have a sufficiency of
Provisions to carry us down, And you well h o w if they were to be
purchased here, u-c have not ihe means.
I have paid your draft on Messre Briggs for One Thousand D o l l a ~ ,
and am indebted to them about that sum for the Brigs Expences
since we firrived here, and are daily encreasing, u4thout any means of
paying them; as yet - Should you be in want of any more money,
I should suppose it would be more proper for you to draw on the
State or Navy Departments, as you may be authorized, and to. ?revent your Accounts interfering with the Brigs, as I do not thl* 1
have any authority to draw money for any other purpose than paymg
her disbursements; and no doubt you have authority to draw for other
purposes. -

Should you determine to remain here, and go in search of the Bashaw
for you to let me know as soon as you can, that I may
it will be
make arrangements accordingly, and leave this as soon as possible,
as it will certainly be improper for me to remain here while you make
the experiment, for most likely I shall have time to go down, and return,
before you arriue at this place.
Your Letters have gone forward by Cap! Thorn, who sailed from
hence on the 26* ult? and has since had a fair I h d , so that most
likely they urill soon hear from us - By your Letter, you do not
say you have absolutely engaged those People, that came with Mr
Farquliar, if so, I think it %-illbe u-ell, not to do it a t present, but to
hare them and as many more as can be found, in such a situation,
that they can be collected in a short time, without making any further
promise. t,han to Employ them, if you should leave this by land, as
they w-ill be only Lumber on board of a ship. Should you give up the idea of going in Pursuit of our friend, and
still wish to remain some time longer in this Country to try to hear
from him, whether it would not be better to return to this place, as
you will hear from him nearly as soon, if not sooner than at Cairo,
and we shall both be 0x1 the spot to acq as we might think best. Add to that, I fear so large a party at Calro, for such a length of time,
pi21 be imposing on the goodness of our friends. I am sure you will pardon the hints I hare given in this Letter,
when you loo$ at the situation we have conle here in, the many obligations we are obliged to be under to our friends; and the uneasiness
it must necessarily give me - and I am confident your own feelings
will not allow you to look back upon their goodness. Please make my best respects to your party; and believe me

by

SIR
the first Vessel that has sailed for the United States since the ship
Venus CaptYJames E. Can] for Kew York: a mortifying circumstance
at a moment so pregnant with important events: and no doubt must
have afforded time for the advice of the actual declaration of War
on the part of Spain against Great Britain to reach Government
before this letter will be recei~ed. Least this should not be the case
& that the inclosed letter from MF Pinckney should not contain the
Manifesto, I shaU inclose the translation published in the Portugee
Gazette with an English Translation.
Government are best able to appreciate the beneficial consequences
that are likely to result to our Country from this event. And their
moderate but firm determined conduct has placed our Country in
that commanding situation, that not to exceed the bounds of reason
& equity in our demands must universally be esteemed a proof of
our forbearance and of the justice which governs our Councils.

Capt? Rogers informs me that his object 1s to obtain hands; but this
will now be difficult, as the prospect of rich prizes since the Spanish
War has induced most of the unemployed Seamen to enter the British
Service. His Bowsprit is sprung & she s7ants a new fore Main sail,
top-sails & a main top sail a 20 Inch Cable & an anchor of 60001b- I
am afraid she will not be rel[e]ased under 20 days quarantine, wluch
is about the time the British frigates from Malta & other unlnfected
ports are detained Report says that two English frigates which were driven into Ferrol by stress of weather have been taken possession of by the Spaniards.
By a letter I have lately received from Kicholas Gilman Esqr
I learn that in addition to the enw, mdice, detraction & abuse concomitant with a public Office, hlercantile jealousy & intolerance
has been making very free with my character as you will see by the
extract at foot,. Kot feeling that I deserved the censure I immediately
called on MessrVacob Doh~mnn8; C? who after many apoligics for
the misfake which had arisen from the hury of business signed the declaration of which a t foot is a copy. I sliall leave you to judge, Sir,
whether they must have felt the most humiliated at such an unqualified contradiction of their unfounded assertion, or I chagrin'd at
finding that an attempt had been made to injure my reputation by
persons to whom I nas not sensible of having given any just cause of
Offence since in office & wit411whom I had always Kept up an intercourse of civilities & general acquantance. As the accusation goes
to impeach my public conduct I hope you will excuse my giving the
particulars that led to it. - It bas long been a custom in this
Country, when it 112s intended to take the bencfit of the Law granting
the priviledge of going out with the inward Cargo, to report the
Vessel at Bellem as bound for some foreign port & t l ~ a tshe put in
here on account of winds, weather or accidents, the Law requiring
circumstances of this nature to entitle Vessels to the priviledge. With
a declaration of this report from the proper Officer at BeIIem a etition
was made by the Vice Consul to the Administrador of the ustomhouse (here) t,o grant the Vessel franquaie, (that is thc priviledge of
going out again without breaking bulk) and with very few excrptions
the petitions u-ere granted in two or three days. Some time in July
last an aviw was received h t the Cu~t~ornhouse,
purporting, that in
future all franquaie for Bread Stuff loaded vessels should be granted
at the Cornmarket only. Two Swedish & English Vessel w-ere the
first subjected to i t ; and had been severaI days embarrassed when
the Brig Traveller of Newbury port, CaptQalph Randers arrived
from Philad* the 30 July and the Brig Venus of New York, Capt*?
James, E, Carr arrived from that port the lBtAugust - Learning
from my Vice Consul that they were likely to be embarrassed also,
I went t.o the Corn market & finding that they would grant the necessary sertificate to clear those two Vessels at the Customhouse, without
.our making the pititions that had been customary at the Custom-a

house, & which the English & Swedish Vice Consuls had made. I
desired the Vice Consul to take the Certificates & to clear thevesssels,
which he did the next day the 4 t h & they both proceeded directly to sea
notwithstanding, one of the Swedish Vessels was detained 22 days,
a
the other 20 %.I the British 17 days. The g t @ arrived the ship h

Capte afterwards sold his Cargo here & came to an entry. (The
Orlando arrit-ed the 2Ot@& her Cargo was sold I believe the 22Â°C -)
I had waited thus long in hopes that the Swedish, British, Danish or
Spanish Consuls would make a representation on the subject; conceiving it a matter of delicacy to interfere with the internal arrangements of a Country & not wishing on all occasions to be the k t to
to call in question the propriety of the arrangements of this Government. But finding they did not move I waited on the Deputy Administrador who assured me that he u*ould do what he could to get them
dispatched sooner, & the pa.pers urere afterwards made Current in
five to seven days: till lately when our Vessels being again embarrassed,

SIR AS leaving this port with the Ship in her present condition
would not only endanger her safety but pcrhaps cause myself a great
Deal of perplexity & vexation, I must say that it is only the last
Extremity that would oblige me to go to Gibraltar or leave this before
she has received the necessary repairs I now send you the dimensions of the Sails & Bowsprit wanting for
her, in hopes that they will be so far advanced by the time she is

to require that they should be procured before she is admitted to
Pratique. - PFhen I left Syracuse it was Expected by my commanding Officer, who is the Person that makes all arrangements for the
Squaclron, that I would return, at farthest, in two months; and with
this belief, certain Service has been determined on for the Constitution
to perform, which the long &- Boisterous Passage I have Encountered,
added to the unforeseen detention I have met with here, will I am
afraid derange in a manner prejuditial to the service. Cap; James Barron had not the most distant Idea that I would
have met one moments quarantine, neither had the Commodore or I
should have gone Elsewhere to procure the Seamen I want, and as
Syracuse has been particularly pitched on, as a Rendezvous for the
Squadron, owing in a great measure to its having no Commerce and
of course Vessels from it not subject to such rigid restrictions as they
are from the Commercial Ports of Sicily; This being the case I was
particular.ly careful not to have communication with any Port or Vessell since I left it - I believe that no British Man of War has been
in this Port under similar circumstances for these four months, if
Ever. I t is necessary that all the sails should be made of Canvass in
strength equal to PI;? 1, 8: I should prefer Rusia if it can be procured If there is an English Sail Maker at Lisbon the furnished dimentions
will be fully sufficient to govern him, without any thing farther on
the subject. [Mass. HS.

Terms, not only replete with abuse to myself, but in language Pointedly insulting to every officer in the Service, and even so, to every
Man who is by profession a Seaman; and that altho the Business
which brought me here, in an Illogical sense, very ill comports of my
disputing with you, yet that I am neither disposed silently to submit
to what I had reason to consider an Official neglect of your Duties to
the Publick Ship I command or with any abuse to myself. - If I
had "outstepped the bounds'z as you were pleased to consider, which
ought to have secured a respect to you as the Consul of the U. States,
you had redress in your Goverment, as my letters were of a Publick
Nature: But Sir, you have been pleased to put them on a different
footing, and altho fully aware of the unpleasant consequences & injury
that may arrise to our Country by a Personal dispute, yet as a Soldier
you have left me no alternative, but either that of heniously distorting
Tears from the Steel of the Sword I wear, or take you at your Word;

January 5th1805
SIR I herewith forward you my Quarterly Book to 3ls! December
1804.
The request in my letter of the 7 t h Septr last respecting the dates
of e n t q , of all the Officers, I now beg leave to repeat.
I wrote you the 7'h Sept: last that the public provisions at Malta
were r e d by 3%' Higgens without Invoice, since which the Transport
Ship AEfred has arrived here with provisions and other Stores, and
without a particular Invoice there was a general one of so many Cask,
boxes &c. - but a quantity of Cheese and bread r e d by her had no
mark whatever on the Cask nor did the general Invoice throw any
light 011 rt. The Cheese recQhere by the John Adams wTasall spoil'd
before it was landed, immediately after which, it was surveyed by
Order of Commodore Barron and the whole of it condemn'd, the
cheese which I recd from the last Store Ship was at least two thirds
of it rotten - would i t not be much better to purchase Cheese and
Vinegar in the Mediterranean as they may be wanted; than to Ship
them from the United States. - Dutch Cheese I beleive may be
purchased a t Malta much cheaper than American Cheese can be
Ship'd from the United States, including freight and the great probability of its ~ o t t i n g- Vinegar can be purchased in these Seas much
better, and I beleive for less than the freight of that ship'd from
America. - The Candles r e d by the John Adama are all unfit for
use, being run together, having been melted by the heat of the hold
indeed all the Candles wc get from the United States are very soft,
and bad, I n consequence of which I am certain that more than
double the quantity are used - would it not be a piece of econemy
to send out Wax Candles or Wax & tallow. half of each.

Lisbon 7 @Jan? 1804 [5J
SIR Conscious of the rectitude of my intentions & propriety of my
conduct I should not have troubled you with an answer to that part
of your letter of the 4 t h & private letter of the StQInsts, which I suppose
were intended as a reply to the first part of my letter of the 3l4, it
likewise not appearing to me that they require a serious answer, had
you not with that disengenuousness which has marked your letters,
attempted to wrest a single word in my letter to imp1 a reflection on
our Navy. But I trust that the good sense of the O&cerJ will never

K?4

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS

263

allow of such an illiberal construction; as they must observe, that so
far from such a reflection, I declared in the most explicit terms that
my observations entirely grew out of your letter & by consequence,
as originating with you the expressions could not apply to any other
Man or body of Men & renders you the only censurable person, &
farther that I made a distinction between the Officer & h e Man by
o b s e r ~ n gthat my letter was to Captv Rogers of Baltimore & considering the observations as to a private individual, it must evidently
appear that they were not intended t o apply to a professional body:
for then as now I really thought your unprovoked unfounded & virulent attack did no credit to a Commander of a Ship of War or to any
Officer of respectability in the Navy. But to do away d l doubts or
misapprehension on this point I declare in the fullest manner that I
had not the most distant idea of passing an indiscriminate nor any
reflection on the service: so far from which I think the Officers of our
Nary have done great honor to themselves & as a whole, i t has done
much Credit to our Country. I must farther declare that I am personally acquainted with several Officers for whom I have a great
respect & esteem; and as the only frigate before the Constitution
that has been in this port since I have been in Office I hope i t will not
be distorted into an invidious distinction to declare that the Gentlemanly conduct of James Barron Esq' & his Officers while in port,
impressed me with these sentiments in their behalf. - After this
declaration I trust the service will exonerate me from intending any
expression derogatory to it: and even without this explanation I
cannot conceive that such an imputation could in any shape be
attached to me, unless the character of the Xayy depends on the
reputation of a single Man, which would imply such a dearth of Merit
that I am certain it will not be trhecase in our day It neither according with my feelings nor leisure to continue a
correspondence of this disagreeable nature, altho it certainly is the
easiest thing in the TYorld, both by fact & arournent to prove you wrong
in every sentence, after the following rema& I shall take a final leave
of the subject; my duty to my Government & my Country as a ublic
Officer, however free from such an obligation you may fee[ not
allou-ing me to notice your letters in any other manner than to submit
the whole correspondence to Government & trust to its fiat for our
or my censure or acquital, particularly as your remarks have geen
levelled a t my public conduct - And by way of close I must say that
had you instead of writing violent letters to me because you happened
to fancy I was in the wrong, employed the time in minutely informing
me what was wanted for the frigate & giving such instructions (without waiting till I was obliged to request this information) as would
enabled me to have made the engagements, would indubitably havebeen
much more for the advantage of the service, as you say, you are pressed
for time, and whether it would not have been more within the line of
your duty & more to your honor, I shall leave, as I before observed,
to Government to determine.
The petition is dispatched for the ship to be admitted to Prattic
the last of this week, say friday or saturday.
The seamen n7hom I sent down the 5'8 say that you engaged to
give them $20 in advance: but I think they might easily have been
engaged for $12 - however, I don't know but its good policy to offer
the $20 as this is generally of more consequence or a t least more
mteresting, than the Wages pr Month on time of Service and every en-

264

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1804 TO 1805

couragement at this time is necessary. But I have only engaged to
give the rest $12 in advance, paying them five dollars down under
Security & the rest to their Landlords when I have your receipt for their
bein on board; I could have wished you had informed me the Wages
for a73le & do. for ordinary seamen, & particularely how far to go asto
advances I was glad to hear that there is a probability of part of the Bowsprit answering again. I observed to the Carpenter, that I thought
it probably would & this to-gether with the enormity of the expense
I desired him to inform you of.
The Cable is engaged to be made here; it will be done in a day or
two - I s it required on board before the frigate ets Prattic. I
cannot obtain an anchor of the size, of any individun in Lisbon; the
lar est to be found is about 4,500 9 - Possibly the Government
\ilji spare one The sails are in hand & will be done in ten days - NO 1 English for
the fore sail N" for the Main & 4 for the Mizen Top sail - the Main
& fore top sails of the first quality of Russia Canvass, tho: not the
best of the first quality but the best in Lisbon Will it not be well to take the Bowsprit out & let it be towed up &
examined: the moment it is out it will be sent for: as the Carpenter
can see when i t is out with his spy glass - or word can be sent up
when it will be taken out -

Your letter of yesterday's date has been received. The President has deemed it expedient to put all our public Ships
in a state of preparation for service. The Frigates now in ordinary
require great and expensive repairs, and to repair them the sum of
$200,000 has been considered necessary. This Item for repairing
Vessels may be moreover supported by the consideration that it
will be an ultimate saving to repair them thoroughly in season. The sum of $22,935 is required for the payment of the OfEcers
and Seamen comprehended in the two last lines of the Table laid
down in the 65w page of the printed report referred to by you, which
are preceded by the words "at navy Yard Washington, & other

Navy Yard a t this place - and the sum of 1250$ is required for
Medicines &g for the same. The first sum in the 8OtPpage of the printed report above alluded to,

I have this Day received 16 Men as pr list herein Enclosed - As the
Ship will be admitted to Prattique on Friday, I could wish to see

saved by sending it before; The Completion of the Bowsprit & Sails,
requiring so much time as to leave room for every thing else being
furnished long before they can be ready - I agree with you that it
is better the Seamen, procured at Lisbon, should on1 receive in
advance $12, provided the difTerence between that L Jwenty, does
not make any material difference. - I t is robust healthy Men, and
at the same time good Seamen, that are most wanted; Indeed I would
rather have one Man of this description, than a Dozen Ordinary: Seamens Wa es is $10 & Ordinary Seamen $8 pr month - However
I do not wisfl any Ordinary Seamen except they are Stout, Robust
Men The Enclosed list of Surgical Instruments are wanting for the
Hospital at Syracuse & if they are not to be had at Lisbon, you will
promote the Interest of the Service by procuring them from London
and forwarding them to William Higgins Esqr Navy Agent at Malta
by the first opportunity. The Carpenter has this afternoon recieved the Bowsprit and I am

SIR, In my letter of yesterday I communicated the information we
have obtained here of Bengaza and Derne having been reinforced
with Troops, and a Gun Boat at each place, further intelligence states
that these Boats were obliged to press hands for the service by a descent on shore a t those places, and taking them by a Coup de Main.
This Augurs well, i t will certainly be proper to look into those places,
and if a good providence should put them into our hands with a little
hazard i t will compleat our expedition and your glory, objects worth

a severe Indisposition rendered me incapable of any application to
Business for several Weeks past. I avail myself of the first moments
of Convalescence to convey to Your Excellency my unfeigned thanks

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS

for the friendly Disposition evinced in your Rep1 to my Communication
respecting the Outrage committed on some i%oefl Sailors by Individuals belonging to the Crew of a French Privateer in thisHarbor, and
I feel much satisfaction in being able to add that this Affair has terrninated more favorably than its fist aspect denoted - the wounded
Americans being on the Recovery, the Privateersmen have with my
consent been liberated by the Governor & all further proceedings
suspended. I now again take the liberty to address Your Excellency on a
matter of immediate & serious moment to the Interests of the United
States and not entirely indifferent to those of His Sicilian Majesty By the papers [I5 & 21 December 18043 which I have the honor to
transmit enclosed for Your Excellency's perusd, you will precieve
that the application recently made by Commodore PrebIe, to the
Royal Marine Department for a renewal of the Loan of a certain
Number of Gun Boats and Bornb Vessels to co-operate with the Squadron under my Command in the ensuing Campaign against Tripoli,
has not met with that Success which he as well as myself expected &
ardently desired. The accompanying Copy of General Fortinguerra's
Answer contains a statement of the reasons for the refusal - I am
fully sensible of the weight which upon a general View of the Subject
these reasons derive from the present Situation of His Majesty's
Dominions in relation to the Barbary Powers, but at the same time
it is impossible for me to reco-pize their force or propriety as they regard
the application in question, which embraces so small a proportion of
that description of Naval force adapted for the defence of the Coasts,
and vc-hich proportion cannot be considered as entirely diverted from
that object, since it is to be employed in offensive measures against
the common Enemy of His Majesty and the United States, I will not
time by discussing a point upon
however trespass on Your EX-CY'~
which I am 1%-illingto flatter myself that our Ideas are the same - it
is sufficient for me to declare openly to Your Excv that this unexpected
refusal operates as a severe Disappointment to my plans and shou'd
the Neapolitan Go\~ermlentpersist therein, the operations of our
Squadron will I fear be comparitively weak and ineffectual for want
of those Succours from which y e derived such essential advantage
during the last Campaign, and it 1s scarcely necessary to state to Your
Ex: the difficulty of procuring Vessels, suited to the Warfare in which
we are engaged, from any other quarter a difficulty which is augmented
by the advanced state of the Season - Impressed therefore with the
Urgency of the Occasion, & encourag'd by a recollection of the friendly
Sentiments which Your Ex: has in repeated Instances manifested
towards the United States, I am induced earnestly to solicit you to
exert that influence near His Majesty, urhlch I cannot but believe a
long series of eminent Services added to the Weight of Superior talents
must yet preserve to Your Ex. in His Majesty's Counsels, in order
that He may be pleased to reconsider the application without dela
and grant me if not all, a part a t least of the Auxiliary force to whic
it refers. The Bomb Vessels are of particular consequence to our
contemplated Operations against the common Enemy, I consider
them indeed as indispensable to ensure our Success; Could these
therefore be had even without Gun Boats, they would form an addition
to our force of no inconsiderele value. I make no apology for this claim on Your EX:'^ friendship and

interference, influenced as I am by the importance of the object to my
Country, and I prefer i t with the more confidence from the reflexion
that in the great end to be obtain'd the Interests of His Sicilian

Commodore BARRON
DEARSIR Since the letter that I r e d from Mr Dyson, under date
of the 14tW1timo, and which was answered on the 27th I have been
in a very unpleasant suspense respecting your health. - M' Higgens
informed me that he had received a letter from M: Dyson of the 24tQ
of Dec' and one from Mr Kadsworth of the Is! inst in the first of which
was your health mas stated to be worse than when he wrote on the
14th - And in the latter it was said to be better, and as we have seen
none of our Vessels here from Syracuse since your departure, I am
much in want of that full information respecting your health which I
wish to have.
Mr Pulisse, Consul has just called upon me, and informed that he
has been told by the Cap? of a Vessel from Constantinople, on whom
he says he can rely, that a Tripoline Corsair has taken two Ragusian,
two Greek and two English Vessels loaded with Grain, and sent them
for Tripoli or rather for the Port of Benjesza; That in consequence of
this, the Port had Ordered a Frigate to go in pesuit of this Pirate and
her Prizes. How far this account is to be credited I cannot pretend
to say. If i t is true it will be favorable to us, as it will create more
Enemies for Tripoli -.
A Convoy from England is now off here, some of the Vessels have
entered the Port; but the Ship of War, on board which are all the
public letters, not having yet come in, we have no particular accounts
of What is doing in that quarter. - The war with Spain seems yet
uncertain.We have nothing from the U States - The cause of
the Am. Brig Favorite CaptWove brot into this place, for attempting
to go into Genoa, came on last Tuesday; when the Judge pronounced
on the Violation of the Blockade, that the Americans having been
heretofore exempted from the same rigour on this point, to which
the Neutral Europeans were subjected, he could not condemn the
property; but he should subject it to pay the Expences of the Captors
in bringing her in. This penalty is a New doctrine in such cases.
There a pearing to be some defect in the Papers as to the Keutrality
of the essel and Part of the Cargo, i t was ordered to be retained for
further proof. -

hope may be very soon both on this, and other Accounts - We are
informed that the Quarantine in Sicily is reduced to 14 days, and I
hope it will soon be taken off entirely, when I shall certainly go over
to Syracuse, if you should not come here before. - I have heared
nothing more on the subject of sending the Tra.nsport to Tripoli for
stock since I wrote to you last. She still remains in Port. - Robertson has informed me that the small Vessel in which he went to
Tripoli is now Chartered by the Bashan's Agent here to carry over
Powdcr & Military Stores, and he has promlsed to give me further
information on t,h&Subject, but as I do not find his account confirmed
from other Sources, I have some doubts of the fact. Should i t however, be so I trust she will be arrested in her progress Mr+Lear

some information from the object of our expedition
The experiment I think with you, is a hazardous one, but there is yet a probability
of success, and I have no doubt, should you be able to have an intervrew with him, but you would & on something that would prove
advantageous to both parties.
You will perhaps be a httle surprized to receive another dispatch
from me, dated at this place, but as your Letters did not leave Cairo
before Friday, or perhaps a day later, I have thou ht proper, for
reasons which I shall mention, to send off this letter, eing confident
that it will not detain me more than two or three days longer than
otherwise I sllould have stayed. 1" A fear that in our hurry to send off your dis atches, you might
not recollect to sen forward such Receipts and ouchers, as will be
absolutely necessary for me to have, for Moneys Bdvanced, on settlement of my accounts a t the Navy Office,agreeable to promise in your
Letter of lot@Dec'
2"d a fear that you might not think of making arrangements for
M' Farquhar and his party
They are here on shore at a very
heavy expence - if you have not already fixed on some plan, I
should suppose it would be best for him, if i t can be done by honourable
means, to disengage himself a t least from the men by giving them a
few dollars, each with a promise to Employ them when you might be
in a situation to do it - I can see no manner of use he can be of to
you here at present, and should recommend his returning with me,
as he has been at Cairo with you, and is acquainted with most circumstances, he might be able to state to the Commodore, some things
perhaps that you may not cal! to mind a t this moment. 39 And a principal reason IS a hope that before ou receive this,
you may have hear'd something further, or before get en Answer
from you, some of the Couriers, sent from here or Rosetta may
return. I am convinced that you have made every proper aod necessary
arrangement for your expedition, and my departure from this Yet for fear something may have slipt your memory, I thought it

I now enclose for your perusal, Copies of Commodore Preble's last
Communication to me and of his application to the Neapolitan Government for a renewal of the Loan of Gun Boats &c. with the Answer
of the Minister of Marine, from which you will perceive that that
application has not met uith the Success which Corn. Preble as well
as myself expected & ardently desired. I am in daily expectation of
a Letter from General Acton a t Palermo in Answer to one written
him a few days since stating the ill Success of our request & earnestly
soliciting him to exert that influence with the King, which I conceive
he must still retain in his Counsels, to induce him to reconsider the
Subject and grant us, if not all, at least a proportion of those Succours

so essential to our contemplated operations against the common enemy
of his Majesty and the United States; but, I must confess to you m
dear Sir, that my hopes from this quarter are very slender indeed:
for I consider the reasons assigned, by General Fortinguerra for his
refusal as a mere political pretext or Subterfuge, intended to veil the
secret influence which is evidently operating to our disadvantage in
the Neapolitan Counsels and appears already to have converted their
former Spirit of Amity and accornodation into a marked Coolness
and indifference. Whence this secret influence has its Spring, I cannot as yet determine - a very short time will probably bring it on
the face of day; but I am the more persuaded of its existence and its
fruits from information which has just reached me from Messina,
where Captain Dent of the Nautdus has been denied all Supplies of
Tinlber &c. from the Public Stores in that Port, notwithstanding the
united exertions of our Agent Mr. Broadbent to procure them. I
fear this business will be productive of many serious inconveniences
to the Service - indeed we begin to feel them already, for the frigate
P~esidentis now waiting here for Timber suitable for fishes for her
fore Mast, (damaged in a Gale of Wind off Tripoli) which I calculated on receiving from Messina without delay, and cannot be got
ready for Sea until it is obtained. You may rely upon my taking the
earliest. opportunity of acquainting you with General Actons Reply,
to the Receipt of which I look forward with no small degree of Interest
& Anxiety. I notice particularly what you mention in your last Letter respecting a Communication of recent Date from the Spanish
Consul at Tripoli, relative to a Negotiation with the Bashaw, grounded
on some Intimations from Mr. Davis at Tunis, and I coincide entirely
with your idea that the business is now recurred to, with a view to
draw something from us. I beg leave to refer you to Captain Campbell for the particulars of a Conversation which took place on the
same Subject betwixt him & Mr. Davis whilst the former was at
Tunis early in last ?rfont,h; From the information He will give you
added to the perfect Knowledge you have of my Sentiments on this
subject; you will doubtless feel yourself fully prepared to answer the
Cornmun~cationsof the Spanish Consul.
I beg you will accept my warmest thanks for the kind Solicitude
expressed in your several Letters respecting my Health; the anxious
wish you mention to see me a t Malta, be assured is perfectly coincident with my feelings and wishes, but my Recovery from the painful
Siclmess I have experience is so slow and gradual and impeded by
such frequent & debilitating Relapses that I cannot calculate with
any certainty on leaving this place at present. I beg ou will present

Russian Colours etained by part of the American Squadron before
Tripoli - The Consul for the United States nt Naples has transmitted me the Copy of a Letter from your Excellency on that affair,
and I am greatly concerned to observe that the false representations
made by Captain De Riga have led you to suppose that the flag
of His Imperial Majesty has been violated and insulted.
Having already communicated to the Russian Consul at hlessina
all the circumstances and details of this transaction in a Letter which
I had the honor of addressing him on t,he 3 d ultimo, i t is useless to

particular relative to the detention of the St. Michael
Your Excellency will permit me to assure you that the Squadron
which I have the honor to Command will never be wanting in that
Respect to the flag of His Imperial Majesty which is due to the Friendship & good understanding that subsists betwixt the two Countries,

setting in tl. heavy Sea against the Current of the Nile a t its mouth
has barred the bogas so that u-e shall probably be compelled to remain

of seeing you thls morning I omitted
in my wmmunications of yesterday to mention a circumstance which
is not wholy indifferent - the morning we left Cairo, Saturday last
intelligence came from Harnet Bashaw to his Minister, that he had
gotten as far on his march in lower Egypt as the Province of Fiaune,
it appears he is accompanied by a host of arabs, who are gathering
round his standard, Zealous to aid the measure of recovering their
Country - I am impatient to have an interview with you and him
in Order to arrange & decide on proper measures to be pursued. This event cannot now be retarded many days, I shall seize the earliest oppertunity of coming to you, and no doubt the Bashaw is equally
solicitous. [NDA. I s m Hull LB, 1803-1806.1

To William Jarvis, U. S. Consul, Lisbon, Portugal, from James Gambier, British

LISRON Jan? 1805.
SIR, Since I ha,d the honor of a conversation with you Yesterday on
the Subject of the American frigate now in the Tagus receiving
English Sailors. I have learnt that the evil I complained of, is
increasing to such an extent, as to render it necessary for me to
trouble you with some further Observations.
The Spirit of the British Constitution requires the Services of all
our seafaring Men, for the general defence of the Country, whenever
our fleets may stand in need of them, and altho' in some instances
Protections are granted, they are only given with the view to encourage
our own Trade, and are only valid so long as those who possess them
are serving their own Country in some way or other, consiquently ever
British Sailor who enters into the Service of another Country when
called upon to serve His Majesty is guilty of a breach of Duty, and
is in effect a deserter from his profession and the cause he is bound by
allegiance to espouse.
In returning you therefore my thanks, for your assurance that
deserters of evey d~iacriptionshould be given u p ; I must at the same time
observe that it is evident from what I have stated, that under the existing circumstances all British Sailors in the Service of other States,
may be considered as coming under thls discription. There can be no doubt, but that it is the interest of every Nation
to discourage as much as possible acts of disloyalty committed by a n y
Subjects or Citizens towards their respective Governments -but when
the Nature of the War in which great Britain is at present engaged
is considered; it is not too much to say, that those States, which in
the present contest profess to observe a perfect Neutrality, are peculiarly called upon not to endeavour to diminish our means of carrying
on an effective War by encoura 'ng our Seamen to depart from their
duty by serving them instead o us. I feel confident that under the circumstances the Government of
the United States will acknowledue the Justice of my requesting; that
Captg Rodgers will have the Goodness to discharge such Brltish
Sailors as may have abondoned their duty by entering on board the
Ship under his command, which request I beg of you to communicate
to him, and to inform me of his answer.

SIR! The letter, which you address'd on the 18 August last to my
Predecessor in the Command of the Naval forces of the U States in
the Med-as
transmitted to me from Constan? about the middle of
last Month & opened by me in the absence of Comm: Preble who a
short time before had sailed on his Return to America - The long
& severe Indisposition I have suffered & which by confining me to my
Bed for several Weeks past has rendered me incapable of application
to Business, will I flatter myself afford s ~ c i e napology
t
for not having earlier opened a Correspondence with you. - I n your Letter I
observe nothing that requires particular Observation on my
derive much satisfaction from the assurances you give of the %""Y ighly
favorable Disposition of the Russian Court towards the U. States a Disposition so congenial with that entertained by our Government
and I cannot but regret that our Warfare with Tripoli & the Duty
which those entrusted with the defence of our Commerce & the Honor
of our flag, owe to their Country & to the Service, shoud give rise to
events that may for a moment put a t hazard the Good understanding
so long subsisting betwixt the two Countries - You will readily
perceive my allusion to the Detention by part of the Squadron under
my Command, of a Vessel called the Sb Miguile loaded with Grain
under Russitm Colors, which took place in Sept: last & of whicb you
are doubtless 'ere this inform'd, But judging from the Duplicity &
falsehood employed by the Master (Dede Riga) in his statements to
the Russian Agents in this quarter, I have every reason to suppose
that your information touching the &air must be imperfect & unsatisfactory - perhaps garbled and erroneous, as i t is to be presumed
that those Gentlemen who appear by their Correspondence with me,
to have taken up the matter m a style of warmth & pre-'udication,
inconsistent with that Colness & Deliberation which oug t ever to
mark the Diplomatic Character, have written to their Court in the
same spirit of Intemperance & Misrepresentation, I therefore embrace

284

the first moment of retuning Strength to convey to you such correct
& circumstantial Information as may enable you to answer any complaints which the Russian Government may address to you in this
case
The inclosed Letter to which I refer you from Capt: Campbell, Cornrnandg the Constelhtion frigate, by whom the St Miguel was
captured will acquaint you fully with all the particulars of her Capture On comparing this Account with the Communications from the
Russian Consul in this Island, Copies of which are also inclos'd you
u~illobseme that they vary in several essential points, & in those upon
which the legality of the Capture entirely hinges. I t is scarcely
necessary for me to point out to you Sir which of these Statements
is most consistent with Truth - Captain Riga has stated, that where
captured he was 60 Miles b e t w i ~ tGerbys & Tripoli - At the t,ime
he was discorered by our Squadron. I was myself cruizing off with the
President frigate in Sight of Tripoli & when the signal uTasmade for
the Constellation to chase the strange Sail, the latt'er was to the Eastward of Tripoli (whereas Gerbys is to t'he Westward) & according to
our observations not more than 6 Miles from the Coast - He further asserts that he made no attempt to escape, & the Russian Consul
as you will perceive lays great stress upon this as a proof of the Captain's Innocence, but the position being false the inference drawn
from it must be the same, for you will observe by Capt Campbell's
account that the Vessel was not captured till after a smart Chase of
24 Hours, during which he tacked & maneuvred evidently with the
desipn to escape from the pursuit; I n short the representations
which Captain De Riga has made to the Agents of his Nation are
palpably disingenuous & unfounded and calculated to conceal his real
Intintion, which from the Situation we first discovered him in the moderate Weather we had for some time before experienc'd $
thence the improbability of his being driven on that Coast - his
attempt to escape Examination - the scarcity of Water on board his
Vessel - his sudden separation from two Ottoman Ships in company
with him & in fact every incident attending his Capture, I am persuaded was to enter the Port of Tripoli, in defiance of the Blockade
which he well knew to exist - Acting then under these impressions
which the sequel has tended to strengthen, I thought i t my duty to
send him to Malta, where the Cargo, being in a perishing condition,
was sold - The Polacre remains there until the favorable Season,
when she will be sent, with the tm-o others detained at the same time,
to America, unless I shou'd in the interval receive contrary Orders
from Government I now request your attention to that part of the Consuls Letter
to me, relating to an Indignitv which he says was offered to the
Russian Flag on board the St Xrligue1e whilst discharging her Cargo
a t Malta and in treating of which, He has thought fit to assume a
very lofty and in my opinion imperious tone, taking for granted
every thing that the artful & interested Greeks whose Names are
subscribed to a Certificate (Copy of which is attached to his Letter)
have deposed on the Subject - until this Certificate reached me
from M?, DeBecker I was entirely ignorant of any Occurrence of this
nature, no complaint having been made to me a t Malta, altho' I
was there during the time i t is stated to have happened - The descharging of the Polacre was done by Maltese. & I consider this
affair as having originated in some dispute betwixt them and the

-

285

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS

Greek Sailers in itself of no importance, which Captain Riga in the
same spirit of perversion & duplicity which characterizes his whole
Conduct has seized upon as a handle & represented in the light of
an intentional Insult offered to his Â£iag, in order the more strongly
to interest the Russian Agents in bis favor The Papers which I have the honor to inclose relative to the affair
are Capt Campbell's Letter with the Certrficate of the O&cers to
whose charge the St Miguel was entrusted after her Capture marked A. - B. Copy of a Letter from the Russian Agent at hfessina - C. Copy of my Answer and D. a Second Letter from the
same, annexing the Certificate referred to above - These papers
adding to the preceeding particulars will I trust afford you all the
Insight & information requisite to meet any representations from
the Russian Cabinet on honorable & advantageous ground and I feel
confident shou'd a Discussion arise that on your side it will be conducted with that Judgment and ability, which, the importance of
the principle embraced in the affair 87, a due but independent estimation of the political consequences it may involve, will call for. I beg you will take an opportunity of assuring the Minister for
foreign affairs, that I entertain in common with the Nation, under
whose flag I have the Honor to command the most pacific & friendly
sentiments for His Imperial hlajesty b his Government & that the
Russian flag will ever meet with that Respect from the American
Commanders wLich the subsisting amity betwixt the two governments
mutually demands, but at the same time you will give his Excellency
to understand that in our Warfare with Tripoli we must be governed
by a strict adherence to the Laws of Nations & the principles of
Blockade recogniz'd therein & that as such it is the duty of my office
to detain any Vessel, under whatever flag, that may attempt to
enter the Port of Tripoli, so long acknowledged by all the Powers
as blockaded by the Naval forces of the U States. At the close of Your letter to Commo: Prebble I notice some
observations, respecting the disposition recently manifested by the
Ottoman Porte to encourage an intercourse with America, which
had been officially announced to You thro' the medium of the court
of St Petersburg and You suggest to this consideration the proriety of granting certain facilities to the Vessels of that Power k'hatever plans may conduce to the extension of our navigation &
the improvement of our commercial intercourse with distant & friendly
Nations, will undoubtedly experience the fostering hand of Government Q whist I remain in these seas I shall bestow on this object
of which I feel deeply the importance, all the care & attention it
merit's; but the instance you mention, we ought to consider how
far it would be politic or consistent with our National di nity to
court such advantages by a diriation in favor of any partic ar flag,
from these principles which thus far in our contest with Tripoli have
governed us, in relation to Keutrals, as such a diviation would inevitably excite the jealousy of other Powers in amity with the United
States, & tend to involve us in diaculties for which remote & uncertain benefits afford no compensation. I thought it necessary to
ke these remarks to you on ace! of the Dentention of two Vessels
(Greek) under Ottoman colors; captured at the same time with the
Sr Miguele & under similar circumstances, of which you have no
doubt 'ere this received advice.

might have been form'd from the Russian interference & I believe
that my Predecessor had grounds to flatter himself that somethmg
favorable would result, the event appears to have completely disappointed them. For myself I am convinced, and I believe my opinion to be coincident with the sentiments of our Government that

SIR, I have learn'd with e ual surprize & regret that complaints
have been made to the consul of his Majesty the Emperor of ell the
Russias residing a t Messina, by the Master of the Polacre Ship
St Michael, detain'd off Tripoli in Sept' last, by the U, States Frigabe
under my Command, respecting an Insult offered to the Russian Flag
under which she sailed and ill treatment experienced by himself and
crew whist in our possession, and I deem it incumbent upon me to
give to the Commodore of the American Squadron, a succinct detail
of the Circumstances attending her detention,
On the 12@ day of Septr last, being off the Harbor of Tripoli
in company with the Blockading Squadron I gave cllace, in compliance
with the Signals of the Commodore to a Polacre Ship, being one of
three Vessels discovered a t the same time by the several Ships of the
Squadron; The chace was continued until Night, the Polacre going
from us under a press of Sail, when the Wind dying away we lost sight
of her, but at Day-break the following Morning, she was descried again
about 8 Mles to the Windward and the chace was renewed, the
Polacre a t the same time crowding all Sail, and making repeated Tacks,
evidently with a view to escape from us, the Wind however freshining
towards the Evening, I came up with her about Sunset & sent a Boat
with my Second Lieutt on board who returned immediately with the
Captain and his Papers The Polacre proved to be the St Miguel;
D Riga Master loaded with grain under Russian Colors, I n consequence of the orders which I had received, and the suspicious circumstances attached to a Vessel loaded with Grain, found
in the immediate Vicinity of a Port in a State of Blockade I conceiv'd
i t my Duty, to take possession & carry her to the Commander of the
Blockading Squadron, I therefore sent my Second Lieutenant with
three midshi men & 12 Hands on board with orders to take char e
of the Vesse & follow the motions of the Frigate, and immediate y
made Sail to join the Squadron off Tripoli which we did the second day

You are apprized that I have no knowledge whatever of any thing
that took place on board the Polacre, from that time, - It is
scarcely necessary to state to ou sir, tbat during the two Days, that
Captain De Riga was detain180nboard the Frigate, under my Command, He was treated with all the attention & Respect due to the
Master of a Vessel, belonging to a Respectable and friendly Power,
or to assure you that I feel such confidence in the Conduct & discretion
of the Officers to whom the char e of the Polacre was committed,
as well as the Officers generally un er my Command,and in their strict
adherence to my orders, that I have no hesitation in pronouncing the
complaints made to the Russian Consul, as far as they relate to them, a
malicious and mischevious misrepresentation, and altogether devoid
of Truth, for your satisfaction however I shall accompany this with
a declaration sign'd by the Officersthemselves With regard to the Indignity said to have been offered to the Russian
flag on board the Polacre in uestion, I consider the complaint as
equally malicious and unfoun ed, No orders whatever were given
by me for striking the Flag, nor was there any interference of this
nature on the Part of the Officersand Men whilst on board her, I hope Sir that this Plain statement of Facts accompanied by the
Certificate of my Officers will be sufficient to remove from the mind

upon and informed by Cap-ede
with his merchant Vessel named the St Michael and loaded with hard
Grain on his account and his own Crew destined for Spain & Navigated on the Coast of Barbary, when at the distance of 60 Miles or
thereabouts between Girba & Tripoli met with a Frigate & Brig of
the United Sta%esof America by which he was arrested & Afterwards
conducted by the Brig Alone, against all the laws and Customs of all
Maritime Powers, into the Island of Malta as a good prize, under the
supposition of his having intended to enter Tripoly a port blockaded
by the Americans, To contradict that Idea it is sufficient to know that the Vessel taken
was bound direct for Spain as may be seen by his instructions & that
on account of contrary winds alone He approached Barbary in hopes
of meeting on that shore the periodicd winds which might enable him
to perform his Voyage to Spain, Added to these truths which ought to convince the above Commander of the illegality & injustice of this proceeding let him examine
minutely the Circumstances & see if in Any way it tends to verify
the supposed Idea of Cap! Dede Riga it was on the 12tQof September
&hat He approached the Coast of Barbary about 60 Miles between
Girba & Tripoly, this distance shews that all conjectures is False, for

if the said Captain wished to enter Tripoly he would have approached
near that port, He did not attempt to escape, which He might have
done when He saw the Frigate & Brig a t a distance of about 12 Miles,
is this not a clear sign of the Captains Innocence and that the Prize
is illigitimate & Illegal, The undersigned is astonished that not finding a sufficient quantity
of water on board for the destination and the Ship being armed with
4 pound Cannon & a quantity of small Arms should be motives for
detention of said Vessel, - The undersigned as authorized by the
duties of his Oflice and the good understanding existing between His
August soverign and the United States of America, Vigourously reclaims from the above Commander B, the liberation as well of the
ship as the Cargo to Capt Riga & all dama es costs & Interests, the
undersigned is further surprized that the 8fficers of the Frigate &
Brig dared to take & strike the Colours of the said Russian ship &
regard such conduct as absurd in its principle & despicable in its consequence, He cannot do less than inform his Imperial Court of the
manner in which the Russian flag is respected by American Officers &
in what

ship & Cargo, and the Captain indemnified for all damages, praying

you think it proper to demand the Restitution of the Said Dedi Riga's
Vessel, Cargo &c, &c - without having thought it necessary to enquire of me, as to the grounds, on which the Said vessel was captured
& Sent into the Nearest Port You express your Surprise, that American officers should dare to
take, or Strike the Colours of the Russian Ship, which conduct, you
regard, as absurd, & despicable, & that you shall inform your imperial
Court of the Manner, in which the Russian Flag, is respected by
American Officers, & the Commerce & Navigation of their Subjects
impeded As it Respects your charge ai treating with disrespect, the Russian
Flag or impeding the Lawful1 Commerce or navigation of Russian
Subjects, I beg leave to assure you SIT,lt never has been done, by any
officer under my Command, and at the Same time, I beg you to be
informed, that the Flag of no nation, will protect him, who dares enter

was used to elude the pursuit by frequently tacking and by other
Manuovres But By the Superiour Sailmg, of the American Ships, she
was captured, This Sir, contradicts the Assertion of Captain Riga,
"that he did not attempt to escape which could have been effected,
had he been disposed to do so," - I am so confident that it was his
intention to have entered Tripoli in direct violation of the Blockade,
& contrary to the Laws of Nations, that I felt no hesitation in detaining
him, nor Shall I feel myself justiliable in restoring either the Ship, or
Cargo, without an Order from the Goverment of the United States,

30 more will be obtained. Inclosed is a Copy of my letter to Mr de
Araujo relative to the supply of an anchor & his answer. An order
would have been much more agreeable but I suppose this will be
granted.
A few days ago M' Gambier met me on Change & spoke to me
relative to the allowing of British Seamen to enter into our service.
Much conversation ensued on the subject, In which I animadverted
on the conduct of the Commanders of British Vessels of War, and
finally ended by obser~ingthat I thought it an affair more proper for
our respective Governments to come to an understanding about than
for discussion between their Agents, as it did not appear to me a subject
that was left to my option & the only step I felt myself a t liberty to
take was to advise the giving up of Men who had deserted either
from hlen of War or Merchantmen. The next day I received a letter
of the 15@from him, which I had copied & sent to Captain Rodgers:
from whom I received a reply the 16@a Copy of which I inclosed
in my letter to Mr Gambier of the same date. Copies of all which go
inclosed. The correspondence terminated here, nor do I learn that
M TGambier has taken any other steps on the subject The Moorish Frigate here, two or three days ago began to get out
her outriggers preparatory to heaving down I understand from the
Portuguese Agent to the Agents of the Emperor, that it is to inspect
& clean her bottom & that it is probable she will not be coppered.
The Bulwark of the Brig is not yet compleated. With the Frigate at
St Ubes they are not doing any thing. I cannot learn that any steps
have been taken to-ward a Peace with the King of Prussia. As that
Court has been much more in the habit of Receiving than paying
Money for their friendship and it is understood that money is not an
article they are fond of parting with; it is possible they may not be
willing to disburse as much as will sat~sfythe avidity or enlarged expectations of the Emperor founded on the recent success of the Admiral.
But still I imagine that some measure of precaution may not be unworthy of the attention of Government, if two or three Vessels can
be spared for the purpose.
In a conversation the other day with M' Johnstone the Purser of the
Constitution relative to the forgery, I mentioned that it must have
been by some person well acquainted with the arran ements of Government & told him the information I had received rom Cadiz relative
to the Man. He observed that there was an Italian who had been
Secretary to Commodore Morris, that understood three or four languages and whom from the circumstance of his quitting Commodore
Morris about that time without assi ng any sufficient reason, from
his capability & from the Knowledge e must have had of the arrangements of Government he really beleived to be the person. Upon this
I shew him the inclosed letters & he believed it the same hand. He
will look to see if he has not some of his w~itingon board for a comparison; but as I can obtain several of his lett'ers, I c.oncluded it best to
forward those as there no doubt must be some of his writing in the
Secretary of the Navy's Office and also in the possession of Captaln
Morris. The best of the two is about the hand he wrote all his English
letters in, but the French letters to Gonne, Harrison & Lupton are
more of a french hand than the worst; but as well as m y recollection
serves me not compleatly disguised. Mr Johnstone did not remember
his real name.

that I applied for this morning (if on board) in any other shape, than
as liberality will dictate; and that is, as it appears to me; in such a
manner as the Cap! from whom they have absconded should regain
them again: which I suppose can only be effected by delivering them
up to him (if on board) when he comes alongside; for if they are put
on shore you must be sensible that he will never see them again; of
course that it is only doing a just thiig by halves. And we who have so often reason to complain of injustice, ought
not at least to shew a disposition to act so, or set an example of t,he
Kind. In this affair however it is only my business to express my
opinion and it is at your discretion to act as you think proper. Still
I hope that you may view the thing in the same point of light that I
do; and if you pa.y any attention to my application that it will be
such as will prove satisfactory to the party aggreived and will do
credit to those dignified sentiments of justice which our Country has
always professed & acted upto. P. S. If it is not agreeable to deliver them up alongside, it may
be a well to send the men to my oflice & let me take on myself to act
as I may think the Character & Interest of my Country demands.

2O* January 1806
SIR I have now the honor to transmit you a list of American
Vessels sailed from this port, from the 1'; of July to the 31'1 December
1804. likewise my Accounts Current with the U: States for the said

year, with the attendant Vouchers, balance due me 148. Dollars for
which amount I have drawn on the department of State in favor of
Samuel Emery of Philadelphia.
Some time since I was informed by M: Emery that the account
of my advances for the govt during the year 1802 still meets with
some obstacle towards its h a 1 adjustment, but as he has not explained
the nature of it, I am utterly a t a loss to know from whence it can
Arise, inasmuch as, all the original Vouchers were forwarded by me
to the de artment of State, excepting for that part relative to the
postage o letters, which you will readily perceive Sir artre impossible
ever to procure. The late law of congress regarding American seamen I presume
every where must have had the most salutary effects, for since it has
been known to me, not a citizen has evaded from this port, or entered
into foreign service, the captains are less unjust in their treatment of
their sailors, and both we can compel to their duty. - I n my letter
of the 26* of June, I took the liberty of particularizing some of the
benefits which would Arise to the commerce of the U: States in obtaining a permission from the Ottoman port for our Vessels to trade in
the black sea, they were the result of an intimate acquaintance with
the Levant trade, and a long correspondence on this subject with persons residing in those scales, and who are of aclmowledg'd repute. 7
a very few days since I receiv7d a letter from a friend at Constantinople under date of the la*of November; I shall therefore translate
a passage it contains, without a ain trespassing on your time, except
only to observe, that on this d o m a t i o n the most implio~tereliance
may be placed. - "Should an accredited Agent appear here from
the U: States, be assured he would easily obtain every reasonable
demand; this I know from an unquestionable source". - The yellow
fever which in the Autumn was introduced here, intirely subsided in
the beginning of December. - this disorder was conveyed to US by
a vessel from Mdaga, but a t so late a season of the ear, that its
effects have been much less severe than in other parts o the Mediterranean; for on no day did the number of deaths exceed 50. in a poqulation of 40,000. inhabitants who remained in the City. - at Pisa
distant only 14 mdes, altho' the communication was uninterrupted,
yet there was no instance of c o n t a ~ o nin the place; indeed the Malady
did not extend beyond the gates of Leghorn, altho' no salutary
precautions were observed within a circuit of 20. miles.

SIR, I have rec'd your second Letter of the lgth Inst, & now beg
leave to acquaint you that the Danish Seamen you mention (Neils
Dominicus, Martin M. Almmding, Claus Repke & John Bugge) have
been discharged & sent on shore in conformity with the intimation
which I made you of my Intentions yesterday. As i t appears that,
your Ideas, & mine on the subjects of Liberality & Justice bear no
promenent similarity of feature: I take the liberty to make known to
you, that as an Officer in the Navy of the U. States, I should feel
myself degraded, as also the hf~ssionthat brought me to Lisbon irrevocably assassinated, by my Ouw Cons~nt,was I to comply wit-h your
demands; as I cannot conceive that I am bound either by National or
Personal honor to deliver Men into the hands of an authority that
would punish them for their wishing to serve our Country in preference to thew own, particularly when a t the same time, I had no Election in the motive that influenced their conduct.
No Sir I must be permitted to tell you that I concieve such a proceding would be contrary both too Liberality & propriety; as ~twould
a t once be sacrificing one of the essential advantages, which by the
properties of our Soil & the purity of our blessed Constitution we
derive, over all other Nations; & it does not a little astonish me that
you as the only representative of the Goverment of the U. States,
In this Port, should wish to furnish the means of punishing your fellow
beings for prefering F R E E D O M to SLAVERY, particularly when you are

not bound even in t,he slightest Degree either by the Laws of your
Country, the Laws of Personal honor, the Laws of Justice or your
Duty to perform such an act.
If the party Agrieved (if such constr~tctionis applicable) is in any
way injured, I can only repeat that I have not been the cause; and
that by discharging the Men in the manner I hare, I have no more
than exercised the Intention of the authority vested in me by my
Govermt, by leaving the parties in the same situation they were
previous to the Mens entering on board the Constitution - An
application was made to me on Friday last for two Seamen, said to
have deserted from an English Merchant Vessel, & my answer was
that (If on board) they should be sent on shore: Self prepossession
has no weight with me in the Exercise of my Official Duties, consequently I do not feel myself a t Liberty to favour one Nation more than
another without having the special authority of Go-cermt for so
doing. And I hope if in animadverting on certain p a r a ~ a p h sof your

limits of your office, as well as ability, when you attempt to arrogate

SIR I do not pretend to talents or abilities of such a size that I
could possibly refute such soIidity of argument & ingenuity of reasoning without supernatural aid, as is comprised in your Letter of the
2ot@Ins? received last night. Nothing short of a Hercules in mind
is adequate to it. But Sir an sntient story in which you no doubt
are perfectly conversant, relates, that a Giant was slain by a Stone
from the sling of a simple Shepherd boy, I am encouraged to essaye
this mighty task, purely from the belief that if I fail it will be no dlscredit to me, but if contrary to all reasonable expectation I succeed,
that eternal honors await me.
To state our question with logicaI accuracy, I think it stands thus,
Whether it is proper to deliver Seamen to the Captains from which
they httve deserted? I contend it is, you say no. Now let me see
what I can say in favour of my opinion. That i t is encouraging the
Commission of crimes to protect criminals: that to make a ship of
war an asylum for deserters is to encourage desertion, that desertion
IS a crime ergo that granting protection to deserters .or affording them
an opportunity to escape is to encourage the commlsslon of crimes &
therefore as destructive of social order every means ought to be made
use of to suppress desertion. If my point is not proved as clear as
noon day sun by fair logical deduction, why Sir I will never attempt
to prove another logical1 . You see that I have confined myself to
School boy Rhetoric for ear of exceeding my ability & to reduce my
reasoning to a level with all capacities. But as you have given the
Men up my sage deduction cannot apply to you; still, with a due regard to secreting themselves until their Ship proceeds to sea, which will
be the first fair Wind, you will no doubt have an opportunity of
receiving them on board again, without exposing yourself to the
smallgst censure. If I do not answer your Letter with that gravity which becomes a
public officer, it is because I conceive that any person who attempts
to support an oppinion evidently mong is not entitled to be treated
sereously -

SIR Altho: a t the first view of your Letter of the 20th I did not
conceive it deserved a serious answer, yet as I am not in the habit of
sporting with the rights of individuals or treating with levity questions
of National importance, upon further consideration I have concluded
it most judicious to make a few observations in language more worthy
of the subject than in my letter of yesterday least in tivoiding to
assasinate your own honor, the character of your Country may feel
the point of the Steel. Will you aUow me to ask you whether you can make a fair distinction between true honor $ Justice. you certainly must answer in
the- Negative. I must then ask you whether you conceive it just or

honourable in a diplomatique character because he happens to be a
priviledged Man to protect a C r i m b l ? The United Voice of mankind
has answered no. To go to history, you no doubt are perfectly acquainted that the Church assumed this priviledge, in what is emphatically called the ages of Ignorance; but Knowledge has condemned
the practice & the interest of the most influential body of Men that
ever existed has given way to the light of reason & the priviledge is
exploded. Can it be believed that at this moment any other Man or
body of Men, under false notions of honor should attempt to assume
the same priviledge? you no doubt w
ill answer no you, as you "discharged the Men in question & sent them on shore". Had you not
recieved them on board this answer would have been correct, as you
certainly would then in no shape have been implicated; but admitting
them into the Ship entirely changed the case: for if you did it with a
Knowledge of their having Deserted or had reason to suppose this to
be the fact, affording them a refuge was becoming a party to their
crime; if on the contrary it was done without such Knosvledge or
suspicion, or t,hey had deceived you or the Commanding Officer on
board, it certainly was not contrary to the Laws of Ho~pitalit~y
nor
true honor to give them up. But I see no difference to the party
aggrieved, except in the name, between the acknowled ed injustice of
holding them or placing them in a situation to escape; w ich, it appem
to me, is in some sort countenancing $ by conse uence encouraging
the crime. - To say that they went on board rom a love to our
Country is confounding all ideas of causes & effects. As well might
the priest say that the henious criminal who fled to the altar as a Sanctuary did it from a love of religion. His assertion would not decieve a
pious old Woman & his inference of protection would be treated as
absurd.
If I mistake not, the propriety of delivering up deserters has likewise upon some occasions been supported by some of the ablest
Commanders in our Navy; and if the doctrine was othordox then ~t
cannot be heterodox now, without the immutable Laws of Justice have
given way to your convenience, and her scales are to be ballanced to
your interest. To render the thin more palpably indefensible, you
have not even the thin covering o necessity to offer in Vindication
for giving the most indirect encouragement for the desertion of
fore@ Seamen & thereby distressing the Flag of other nations, for
I think I have sent about fifty seamen on board the Constitution.
& it is h~ghlyprobable that nearly the whole number wanted will
be obtained in a way that is by no means exceptionable. However as it appears that you & I differ so widely in sentiment
upon almost every subject & as it is not likely from the partiality
which almost every Man has for his own opinions that we should
come nearer to an understanding, I have concluded i t tbe most
advisable thin I can do to lay our whole Correspondence before
Goverment to et them determine between us, should they deem any
part of it of suflicient consequence to draw their attention from thelr
important concerns.
I have the honor to be Sir Y-0:

SIR, Yesterday we pursued the Kourchet of this Province to its

fortunately fell in there with the Arab cheif of the said Allis, who
had advice five days from Hnmet Bashaw who was then in this
Province with the cheif, named in his letter to me, I have dispatched
the cheif first mentioned to him, who has engaged to bring hunhere If you have any Counter intelligence, please to express it-, I am
suspected and close watched here English Spies; thank the French
Consul, pray request Mr Briggs to desire the Governor to write this
Kourcheck, that he give liberty and an escort to meet Hamet
I should have prosecuted this intention, but the Kourchet would

not permit me to p ~ s his

evening I shall send back the Ma'ority of my party, and wait here
myself the return of my Oued A li chief. Let me know whether your OEcers may remain with me, if you
send by a faithful hand, I should be glad of my gilded Trowsers and

Extract from journal of Surgeon Jonathan Cowdery, U. S. Navy, 24 January 1806

Renegado Wilson, who pretended to be a great engineer, was ordered by the Bashaw to fire hot shot at a mark, but succeded indifferently. The Bashaw, however, was highly pleased, gave Wilson
eight. dollars, and promised to reward him in proportion to his exertions in his future warfare. Wilson engaged to teach the Turks how
to throw bombs, hot shot, and hand grenades; and t,o alter and improve

OF DIMANHOUR
25 Junuuy 1806. -

DEARSIR,After touching a t Malta, the Argus arrived a t Alexandria on the 26th November - Tour letter to Governor Ball produced letters of introduction from him to the British resident at

W D S WITH BABBABY POWERS
Cairo and Consul at Alexandria, and those Gentlemen have cbonsiquently rendered us every assistance which the nature of our affairs
At Alexandria it was
and their duty could require and admit
intimated to me that Hamet Bashaw was not to be had without application to Elfi Bey, to whom he had attached himself, both of whom
were in upper Egypt acting with the rnameluke Beys against the
Ottaman Government And to whom access was barred b the Turkish
army - Under these discouraging appearances, anj contrary to
the advice of every body on the seacoast, on the 30th November I
left Alexandria for Grand Cairo with three officers, Lieutt OBannon,
Messre Mann & Danielson, and a few men from the brig; who, together
with some others recruited on the spot and a t Rosetto made an escort
of eighteen - This precaution was necessary on account of the
banks of the Nile being infested by the wild Arabs of the Desert
and by straggling Amout deserters from the Grand Signor's Army;
the former subsist by plunder, the latter rob and murder indiscrinlinately every defenceless being whose appearance denotes property,
both move in bodies and have rendered themselves terrible throughout Egypt. On the 8th December we arrived without accident, at
Grand Cairo - There 1 found the Prime Minister and one of the
confidential Governors of Hamet Bashaw who confirmed the intimation I received at Alexrtndria thalt] the Bashaw was actually with
the Mameluke Beys and Considered as an enemy to the Government
of this Country. I had dready dispatched to him secret couriers
from Alexandria and Rosetto; and now sent off a third and fourth
from the Capitol - But I had not yet had Audience with the Vice Roy
and not knowing his accessable points the difficulty I apprehended
of getting the Bashaw out of the Country exceeded that of access to
him, for I found it impossible to do it privately; and to attempt i t
might not only defeat out main object but endanger our own personal
Wherefore, at my first interview, finding the Vice Roy a
safety -:
man of much more frankness and liberality than commonly falls to
the character of a turk, I unreservedly opened to him the Object
of my visit to his Country, and received his profer of friendlv
offices - This cleared a little my prospect, whiie it created new
embarrassments; for the interference, or even the amnesty of the
Vice Roy, in behalf of Hamet Bashaw, might excite the jealousy of
the mameluke beys and have the efl'ect to barr his de arture. But
a new difficulty beset me, which I little expected and ess from the
quarter it came. The French Consul, apied-mantese at Alexandria,
a Mr Drovitte, had insinuated that we were 6ritish spies in American
~Wasks- and that our pretext of friendship for Hamet Bashaw
aimed a t nothing but an intercourse with the mamelukes, who are
suspected of being in british subsidy; of course an insinuation as
injurious as it was malignant - I am yet totally at a loss to account
for this strange conduct of
Drovitte - as I am equdly so a t
the indignity of our flag being refused by that of the French throughout this Country, those marks of civility never refused to a fore@
flag, in ordinary cases, and which we received from every other Natlon
represented here; except that, informed of our Object, and pursuing
the same line of conduct with his colleague at Tripoli he thought by
these means, to defeat that Object - I found means however (the
means that move every thing in this quarter of the globe) to remove
this difficulty; and finally obtained the Vice Roy's letter of Amnesty

-

P

302

N A V A L OPERR4TIONS FROM 1804 TO 1805

and passport of Safe conduct to Ramet Bashaw, which was dispatched to him on the 15th, in quadruplicate, and by different conveyances. I now patiently waited the issue of the measlires thus
far pursued - Meantime busied myself in finding out the Tripolitan
emigrants in the Country; their attachment to the rival brothers; and
their feelings to wards the Americans - Among these one appeared
who was only Ninety days from Tripoli, an Arnout Turk, who had
been in the service of Jussuf Bashaw during the blockade of last summer, whom I had under particular examination - Supposing himself
conversing with Englishmen he was very unreserved in his confessions; and being decidedly in the interest of the enemy (he was
enthusiastic in his cause, though willing to dispense with his honors)
his story deserves the more credit. He said Tripoli had lost many men
in the diferent attacks oj the Americans last summer - the town was
much damaged and the inhabitants under such a state oj consternation
that nobody slept in the city, and that no business was done there. He confirmed the account of the fire ship, Infernal, being blown up
by Captain Summers after being boarded by two row-gallies - Statthis fact, the fellow wept! He observed that this was an unfortunate
war for the poor cruisers - They had been lead to beleive that the Americans were all merchantmen; and that the[y]should have nothing to do but
to go out and bring them in: but they found them Devils; from whom
nothing was to be gained in war; and therefore he had quited the senrice
of Jussuf Bashuw - The Bashaw was nevertheless determined not to
make peace with these inJidels until he shall have humbled them and made
them pay for the damages they had done to his navy and city. He acknowledges that Hamet Bashaw had many friends in Tripoli: but said
that Jussuf Bashaw had taken care [?I of him! I t is ascertained that
the latter has employed and payed assasins to poison the former these undoubtly have reported that they had executed their commission and hence we account for the report of Hamet Bashaw's
death - On the 8th instant I received from the Bashc~wan answer
to my letter from Cairo; dated the 28th of the month Ramadan,
corresponding with the 3g of January stating that he should that
day depart for this Province and take lodgings at the house of an
Arab cheif, by name Abdel gamr el be Rouchi where he should wait to
meet me - But as my letters to him dated after the Vice Roy's amnesty all advised him to repair to the English house at Rosetto, under the
arantee of the Vice Roy's passport, and beleiving he might push
h s march thither, I left Cairo for that place the 13 inst and arrived
in three days - Nothing additional appearing there I proceeded
to Alexandria the 19th, on the 20th received the Bashaws answer to
my letter of 28 November of the same tenor & stile that I received
from him a t Cairo - I t appeared that, not confiding in the Vice
Roys dispositions concerning him; or perhaps, not having received his
letter before leaving the Mameluke Beys Camp, the Bashaw had
determined to expect an interview a t the place he first named near the
lake Fiaurne on the border Of the desert, about One hundred and
ninety miles from the Seacoast - Nothing can be more incredulous
than a Turk of a Turk's honor; and for a good reason; nothing can be
more equivocal than their plighted faith. it is an article of barter
and sale. Though travelling in the interior of the country has become
unusually hazardous on account of the jealous of the Turkish cheifs;
of the reins given to licentiousness by the bar arity of civil war; and

t

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS

303

of the strong grounds the wild arabs hold by reason of all restraint
being relaxed on the part of the Turks and mamelukes, who are too
seriously occupled with each other; I determined to attempt a passage
to Fiaume. Accordingly on the 22nd instant left Alexandria with
two o5cers from the Argus, Lieutt Blake and M' Mann, and an
escort of twenty three men indifferently mounted, and on the evening of the 23d found myself arrested at the Turkish lines, between
Seventy & Eighty miles on my rout, by the Kerchief of Demanhour
commanding a detachment of about five hundred Ottoman troops
on the frontier - No Argument I could advance could at all modify
the severity of his first resolution not to let me pass his lines; though in
every thing else he treated us with distinction and great hospitality However mortifying the concession I cannot but applaud the correct
military conduct of this chief: for it was, in itself a suspicious circumstance that a body of armed, unknown foreignersshould be foundshaping
a course for his enemy's rendezvous with no other pretext than to search
for a refugee Bashaw! But this suspiciouscircumstance was strengthened
and aggravated by the insinuations gone out from the French Consul
that we came into this country with secret wiews hostile to the Turks Our situation here was somewhat erplexing and vastly unpleasant.
I do not recollect ever having foun myself on a ground more critical
To the natural suspicion of a Turk this General added a fierce and
savage temper - Of course pround and arrogant. I soon found my
point of approach - I passed high compliments on the correctness
of his military vigilance and conduct; said i t was what I apprehended:
and what I certainly would have done myself in similar circumstances,
but, knowing from character the magnanimity of his soul, I was determined to have an interview with him, in full confidence that he would
aid a measure so purely humane & so manifestly to the Turkish
interest in Egypt in case he would not permit me to pursue my object
personally. At the same time, recurring to the example of thevice
Roy, whose letter I had showed him and signified that I had it in
charge to tender him a douceur in testimony of our exalted opinion
of his name and merit. He was moved - said my confidence should
not be desappointed - and called into his tent a chief of the Arab
tribes called ore ed allies; a wandering host who have from time been
driven or emigrated from the Kingdom of Tripoli since the ursurpation of Joussuf Bashaw; to whom he stated my business, and asked
if he could give any account of Hamet Bashaw? The young chief,
in an extacy, exclaimed that be Knew every thing! I requested him
to declare himself; for I had no secret in my relation with that Bashaw:
You have, Sir, already anticipated his story in the statement I haven
given of the Bashaw's actual position - He added that, twenty
thousand Barbary Arabs, were ready to march with him from this
border to recover their native country and inheritence; repeated that
he knew our plan; and, now that he had seen me, he would plight his
head to the Turkish General to bring me Hamet Bashaw in ten days The Turk accordingly dispatched him with a companion on this
message the next morning - I could yet perceive some simptoms
of suspicion and ap rehension on the brow of my newly acquired
Military friend - h e r e f o r e , without seeming to have any particular view other than a solicitude to meet the man I sought, but really
with a view of removing his ap rehensions, I proposed to him to
return to his head quarters, this h a g e ; send off my escort to Alex-

B

304

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1804 TO 1805

andria; and to wait myself with only the gentlemen in company and our
Servants until our Arab chief should return from Fiaume with the
Bashaw, - This proposal had its desired effect - We left him and
retired to a handsome markee prepared for the purpose; took refreshments he had ordered to be in readiness; and the next morning returned with an additional escort from his camp to this place; where
we found lodgings in Turkish stile provided for us. Thus far I have sketched an abstract of my Journal since we
parted - Do you expect something of Egypt! I t s Antiquities?
Curiosities? Its wonders? You must be disappointed. I am too
much occupied with modern affairs to ransack catacombs or climb
pyramids - for the same reason I have not time to gratify curiosity and as to wonders, can only notice, what I cannot help being impressed
with, the W o n d e w ignorance; wonderful stupidity; wonderjul tyranny;
and wonderfull wretchedness which so strongly mark the features of a
count.ry once the Wonder of the World for Science, Wisdom wholesome
police and rational happiness - There is matter for a volume - I
can only devot,e six Lines to the subject. Not a man reads here; yet
none but thinks himself divinely taught. The Kerchief, of whom I have
spoken above, in a little exercurtion together contrebutions has cut off
between fifty and sixty peasants heads for no other crime but poverty and, just without the eastern gate of the village a gallows is now erecting to hang a child of twelve years, the only son of a chief of the village
Rahonania, because his father cannot pay the contribution levied on
him! God! I thank thee that my children are Americans
JANUARY 31. Since I began this letter Circumstances have accumulated to render our situation more aukward, and I may well say,
ridiculous - The next day after our entering the house where we
quarter a Markee was pitched upon the terrace of an adjoining house,
and a turkish guard mounted there under pretext of resh Air Armed turks were sent into the house for the purpose o accompanying us as a liife guard in our walks - And a sentinal was placed a t
our door in the lower court, t o prevent intruders - Though these
arrangements were vastly polite I should have been very willing to
have dispensed with thern - Yet by appearing frank and easy with
the turkish General his suspicions seemed to have subsided - I
received all these marks of vigilance as marks of attention; thanked
him for his civilities, and assured him that I should be carefull to
make suitable mention of them to the President my master - By
this kind of adulation, Yesterday I so much drew him from his guard,
that he opened his heart and unequivocally confessed that "In the
present convulsed state of this country the Turks ought to suspect
every body, especially the English - but they had peculiar reasons
for suspecting us as the French Consul had declared us British Spies!"
What does not that Savage merit for this wanton and base manner of
exposing our lives to the infamy of a Jibbet! I hope not to meet
him a t Alexandria.
FEBRUARY 16. At Alexandria - We arrived with the Bashaw &
suit a t the English Cut between Aboukir Bay and lake Merioty a
week ago last Wednesday - Here we had new difficulties to encounter: the french Consul had been before hand of me in gaining the
Admiral of this Port and governor of the city; and they, Consiquently,
came to a resolution not to permit the Bashaw to enter the City; nor
to embark a t this port Arguement was useless, for we were too late

f

305

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS

in our application of it - But we felt no other inconvenience than
delay; for The Bashaw had before Come to a resolution to march by
land to Derne and bengazi; and he now moved round the lake to form
his camp at Arab's Tour, about thirty miles west of the old part of
Alexandria - In the mean time I stated to the Vice Roy the contempt his letter of Amnesty suffered from his Subalterns in this place;
in consiquence of which he addressed a firman, by a chaux, to the
Governor commanding immediate compliance with the intention of
his letter of Amnesty - and imposing a h e on him of twenty five
thousand piasbers - This gives us a final triumph in Egypt, though,
I confess, I could have wished the Vice Roy's resentment had not
fallen so heavily upon his disobedient Governor. I din't think it
prudent to advise the Bashaw to enter the City; least Veangence
should retaliate on him the chastisement he has brought upon his
turkish brother of this place We shall therefore take up our lime of
march through the Desert of Lybia towards Derne next Wednesday Our party consists of five hundred men - One hundred of whom are
christains recruited on the spot and employed in our Service - We
shall make a stand at Bombay, and wait fhe return of Captain Hull
with supplies & re enforcements to seize the provinces of Derne &
Bengazi - for which purpose he sails for the Rendezvous day after
to morrow Here is a Ketch in port from Tripoli Sent up by the enemy with
an envoy, to prevent Hamet Bashaw being permitted to leave Egypt;
but not having with h m ~the only Argument which carries all causes
here, the poor d e d must go back in season a d y to give Joussuf Bashaw
information of the fate which awaits him - If our measures are supported he must fly his Kingdom or die - How Glorious would be
the exhibition to see our fellow citizens, in captivity at Tripoli, march
in triumph from a dungeon to thelr tyrants palace and display there
the flag of the United States. [LC. EPP, Vol. 14, Dec. 18, 1804-June 13, 1805.1

The Disbursements of the Constitution will amount to considerably
more than I had calculated, as I am under the necessity of purchasing
a Bower Cable & Anchor more than I mentioned to you in my last

very considerable injury to the Vessels in this Port - indeed some

supprised to find that not only, at least, one half of the Spindle was
rotten, but that it was intirely broke off just in the very part where
it required most strength, so that no part of it could be made to answer

but I have the satisfaction to know that i t is a ood one -4ltho I was not able to get quite so many eamen here as I had

they will be stopped until they are returned. Should you not be able to get Horses there, we can send the same
out again after they have had the use of them a few days. - I
send your Pantaloons and Coat, should you be in want of anything
more, you have only to Command me. - I have nothing new
since you left, only that the servant of our friend, has red a letter
from his friends at Derne, saying that a Vessel had arrived there with
wheat, and was taken away by one of the Bashaws Armed Vessels
and carried to Tripoli. - Not a word about Gun Boats. - You
have said nothing of the men on shore, whether you are still of opinion,

SIR Soon after being honor'd with the command of the U. S.
schooner Enterprize by Comde Preble, I recd orders from Commodore
Barron to proceed with her to Trieste and give her a thorough repair,
in consequence I left Syracuse on the 3'J of Xov' last & arrived at
were an acct of an alarm respecting the Yellow
Trieste on the 20%"
fevere raging in some of the Ports in the Mediteranean orders were
receiv'd from Vienna to put all Vessels from without Cape Otranto
& Corfu under a Quarantine proportionate in time to the Nature
of the case, & I was obliged to remain without communication untill
my case was made known at and an answer recd from Venice, when
I was immediately admitted to pratique. - MT Riggins our Consul a t Trieste was a t Naples, but M' Holland his Partner & deputy
gave me every necessary assistance - I made myself acquainted
with the manner in which the work coud be done, how the necessary
articles cou'd be procured, the terms & quall~tyof those Articles,
and the time it wou'd take to complete her, - I n the result I was
by no means satisfied, - Trieste is a place sprung up within these
25 Years, every Art particularly ship-building in infancy, but one
Yard of any consequence in the place & in that not season'd timber
sufficient for our use,-- 1 fear'd much if the Master got us once
under his Adze he might perhaps make a Job of us, - I therefore
thought best to visit the Arsenal at this place before I determined
(as advised by M' Broadbent our Agent a t Messina) I did so, &
my Mind was soon made up in favor of the Arsenal, every article
was here I wish'd & I had Officers to deal with - I waited on
Count Lespine the Commander of the Imperial Marine, immediately
on my arrival, his mode of receiving me was sincere & friendly, when
I open'd to him my business he discover'd a pleasure in offering his
services, he requested me to Visit the Arsenal (the Officers of which
he wou'd order to go round with me) and if I was pleased with the
place and the work I wou'd see there, lt wou'd give him great pleasure
to issue the necessary Orders for my reception, I found the Arsenal one of the most astonishing places possible
for the human Mind to conceive, for the purposes i t is calculated;
there is not an article necessary for building or repairs that is not

310

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1804 TO 1805

to be obtain'd within the Walls. - Being satisfied this was the
place to repair the Schooner I wrote my wishes to Count Lespine &
requested an answer in nature of a permission, I obtain'd it & on
the third Day after my arrival left Venice for Trieste to bring
the Schooner, we arrived here on the [space] of December
and haul'd her up on the [space] of [space] i t was done in a most
Masterly manner. she was out of the Water & shored up in one
hour from the word heave, (they have five or six hundred slaves
attatchd t,o the Arsenal for this kind of heavy Work) When we came to rip the Schooner to pieces we found her in a most
deplorable situation, it was the astonishment of every one, how
she brot us here, Her Beams were all off a t the ends, the floorings
& futtocks perfect powder & in fact to sum up all its only necessary
to inform you that in addition to building a new schooner we have
to pull to pieces an old one - but there is this pleasing reflection,
she will be more durable than her companions, for better Timber
I never saw than we are puting in her. I have the pick from frames
of Frigates that have been from twenty to five Years dress'd out
numberd & piled away under cover for use, - There never was n
pendant treated with more respect, or Officers with more attentioa
than the Enterprizes has been both here and a t Trieste, being the
first of our Vessels of War in either of those Ports & her construction
so different from any thing they had ever seen, she astonish'd
& delighted, Count Lespine with whom I stand very fare is a French Man,
was an Officer in the french Marine during the revolution in America,
built a Bri In Boston, much of an American in sentiment, and
apears mucf pleased that its in his power to reciprocate in some
measure the favors he recd in our Country, he has often told me
"if you don't put good stuff into the schooner its our OWTI fault,
take the pick of the Arsenal for every thing," - %he fact is that
there are piles of Timber in the Arsenal sufficient for twenty line
of Battle ships but since the Venetian states have come under the
Imperial Government & the Emperor giving no encouragement to
a Navy (which was formerly the pride & strength of Venice) this
Place is going rapidly into decay. The Arsenal is only now a
memento of what it was - when the Venetian States were in their
Zenith. Oh! that one Quarter of i t was in Washington; - what
they cou'd spare so well & we want so much, - I am hurrying on
with the Schooner; as many as can work to advantage are employ'd
daily, I shall certainly be ready to opperate with the Commodore
in his first attack on Tripoli, no curcumstance wou'd be more
mortifying to me than by an unforeseen accident to be prevented

This takes its chance by the way of London & may get to you
before you can get any information of the Enterprise, & I consider'd

Dr SIR, I have not had the pleasure to hear from you since the
28$Qof August last; I presume that your letters must have miscarried.
I frequently write to you, and hope that my letters will come to hand,
although they contain no material information; but as they keep ou
informed of our situation, I have no doubt of their being accepta le,
and believe me that yours are truly so to us.
I have had but one letter from Commodore Barron since his being
in these seas, but I daily expect to hear from him and to receive letters
from our friends in America.
The Crew are all in tolerable health, and we are in the same situation as when my last letter was wrote.
I hope that the United States and His Excellency the Bashaw will
soon make a peace on just and honorable terms.
Please to present my respects to my friends hlonsr Thainville and
Consul Bille.
Myself and Officers offer our most respectful compliments and best
wishes to Mrs Lear.
[Thejollow-ing was written in invisible ink.]
I have wrote you many and lengthy letters since the arrival of
Com. Barron in these seas, but I have not had the pleasure to hear
from you since that event. I have said so much in my last communications that I have scarcely any thing to add. I believe the Bashaw
is desirous of peace, and was a negotiation attempted I think it probably would succeed, for the Bashaw apprehens a very severe attack;
and the apprehension perhaps would have as great an effect as the
attack itself. He is making erery preperation to resist the forces
that may be bro! against him - As I am entirely ignorant of that
force I cannot give my opinion what impressions it will probably make
on these fortifications aud the town, the houses being Euilt of stone
or very little wood about them, they will not su[s]tain that damage
as if they were of wood construction. I sincerely hope that Com
Barron's force will be formidable, and our most fervent prayers are
offered for the greatest success to attend it - I hope when an attempt
is made to negotiate it will be by a person coming on shore, and not
carried on by letter as it was last summer
How happy I should be dear Col? to see you here on that embassyfrom your efforts I should greatly calculate to have our fetters
broken, and again breath the air of [MS mutilated] liberty, and that
compatible with our country's dignity. Should you come here, it may
not be amiss to inform you that the ceremony of audience with the
Bashaw of Tripoli is not like that with the Dey of Algiers that is,
the Consuls do not kiss his hand, - I cannot form an opinion what
the Bashaw's demand will be, but I believe he would take a t thls

moment much less than what he demanded of Com. Preble last
August; and should the attack not prove successful, he probably will
persist on a large sum. I am extremely anxious to hear from you to
know the determination of our Gort respecting the unfortunate situation of its Captive Citizens. Our funds are all expended and mon

Dr SIR,I have been anxiously expecting to hear from you and to
receive some information on the determination of our Gov! - not one
word on that subject have I yet heard - I am anxiously expecting
letters from Com. Barron. - I believe the Bashaw is very desirous
for peace, and has great apprehension of the intended attack; and was
a negotiation to be attempted I think it very probable that it would
succeed, for the apprehension of the attack might have as great an
effect as the attack itself; and shd the attack prove unsuccessful, he
will no doubt continue in demanding a considerable Sum. As I am
quite ignorant of the force which will be brought against this place, I
cannot give my opinion of the probable effect it may have - We
offer our most fervent prayers for the greatest success to attend it.
I cannot say what the Bashaw's demand will be, but I believe he
would take a t this moment much less than what he demanded of Corn.
Preble last Bug" Ourfunds are all expended, and Bills on Tunis are
a t a great exchange against the drawer. Pray have you heard of

As &r as respects Seamen it will be your duty to attend to their
applications for release from impressment; to apply to the proper
board or Officer to effectuate them; to forward notice to this Department of such cases wherein the proof usually demanded by the British
Officers may be wanting; on the release of' any seamen to see that
he is provided with a proper document to protect him against another
impressment; and to send him home or find him a birth on board an
American Vessel. You will correspond regularly with the Consuls in
Great Britain & Ireland on the subject of impressments, and with such
other Consuls and public Agents as that subject may occasionall
require. I n the pecuniary relief you may afford the men, you
keep in view the laws and the explanatory instructions from this
Department. You will also pay the accounts of the Consuls in Great

Alexandria 28+ Jan? 1805
DEARSIR, On going on shore this morning, I found that the Governor had sent to Mr Briggs, to say to him that he had received a firman
from the Vice Roy, forbidding our recruiting Men here, for the service
of the United States, and mshing you and your party to return to
this place, as the People here are becoming very much alarmed. I sent word to the Governor that we had recruited a few Men, since
he gave permission, but as he received orders that they must not be
recruited here, I should give orders for their being discharged, that
they were mostly Maltese, and intended for the Brig. - He appeared
perfectly satisfied, but said he had received information that we were
recruiting, and that some of the Turkish Soldiers were about to desert
c&, - I left Mr Briggs to come on board, to write you, and called on
Mr Farquhar to desire him to discharge the men he had engaged,
After belng there a few moments, a Guard of about twenty Soldiers
came in from the Governor. - I enquired what they wanted.
They said they had orders to warn the Greeks against visiting that
House. - I suppose however their object, was to see if any Turks
were there, and on informin the Commanding Officer, that I was
there, for the purpose of disc%argingthe few Men that were engaged
by the Governors Permission, he went away apparently satisfied. I have however desired Mr Farquhar to discharge them all, and give
up tho house, and take quarters on board. - Should you think proper
to remain, which perhaps you had better, it will be well to send back
all the party to do away their fears, as I have told the Governor, that
I expect them this Evenin . - You will see by what has happened,
that they are very much a f m e d , both at Cairn and here, but without
cause, but, God knows how far their fears may carry them. - I have

DEARSIR,Your Letters of 25tQ & 2TtQ came safe to hand I am
happy that you sent forward the Horses, but yet, you will see by my
Letter of the 2gth that it is the wish of the Governor of this place,
that the party return, I have this day been with him, to try to do
away his fears, but find that he is as much alarmed as ever - he informed me that the chief of the Village where you are, had written to
the Tiftidar, who has late1 arrived from Constantinople, informing
him that you had hoisted t e American flag at Demanhour, and that
we were recruiting a t Alexandria, and that our object must be something more than that of getting the Bashaw- in fact there seems to
be a general alarm. - I have as I wrote you discharged the men
here, and on our visit to the Governor, found two of them under
examination, but got them released immediately, together with the
Keeper of the House where M' Farquhar stayed who had been put in
Prison, and in chains after I left the House yesterday but every thing
is at present quiet. - I fear that something may happen to prevent
their remaining so long. - You will see by what has happened,
that it is necessary to act with great caution, for the eyes of every
body are upon us. The Governor complains very much of the flags
being hoisted, as it appeared at once like enlisting men &c, and 1
must confess he had some grounds to found his suspicion's upon,
after the Letter had been sent to him, and what had taken place
though unseen by us. Should you find the Bashaw approaching you with a number of
men about him, it will certainly be mprudent for him to come near,
under the present circumstance, for fear of alarming the People more,
it will therefore be necessary to send and meet him, and fix on some
place if possible a distance to the Westward to see him. - In fact, take
what steps you may, I fear the Peoples ignorance will prevent their
seeing our object, I hope you will take the earliest oppertunity of
sending in such of the party as can be spared, and if you should want
an Escort, when you are ready to come, we can apply for one from
this place. - I think from what has happened today, it will be
proper, not to shew the flag any more as that seemed to be the grand
ob'ect, with the Governor. hope in God, you will take such measures as will prevent our
having any di5culty with this Government, and that we shall h a l l
convince them, that nothing has been done without their know{

SIR I am induced through motives of respect for your opinion,

abhorrence of the unprecedented & detestable conduct of Mc Jamis
our consul, who has, instead of promo[ting] the public interest; used
every means which a confined and pitiful Intellect could or, at least,
dare suggest: by opposing every obstacle, within the compass of his
confined imagination, to my convenience & the interest of this

the dissimulation of Friendly & Zealous professions: However his
conduct has been too plain to be misunderstood

He made objections to taking bills on London, for the amount of
supplies furnish'd the Constitution, until after he had understood that
upwards of a Dozen of the most respectable merchants had, through
the Influence of Mess'? Brown, Reid & C b f this place; tendered
me their services, with offers of any sums. of money I might require
for such bills; and without even reqwmg a commission on the
exchange: - and to satisfy you that my complaints are instigated
solely through motives of regard for the honor & interest of my
country; I presume it is only necessary to prove that h.lr Jarvis,
either by intention or Ignorance, shew a want of confidence in Bills
which I was authorized, by your instructions, to draw on London;
& endeavoured to oblige me to draw direct on the Navy Departmt,
for small supplies that did not amount $1,000 ; when at the same time
he knew that the disbursements would amount to upwards of $12,000
before the ship left Lisbon; and persisted in drawing in this way,
until I was oblig'd to make arrangements for, and inform him that
I would advance the money's for all the supplies as t,hey were furnish'd: This I was enabled to do through the influence of &lessr"
Brown & Reid, without their requiring any other compensation than
the pleasure of having been instrumental in contributing tro t.he
Interest of the service I do assure you that Rlr Jarvis's conduct was, in almost every
instance, such as to require me the greatest forbearance, to avoid
exposing him by personal chastisement: Indeed nothing could have
prevented me but the respect which I feel for t,he authority that
gave him his appointment - I am aware of the circumstances
under which M r Jarvis is placed here, but I have too much confidence
in the Just sentiment of the President, & the Heads of Department,
to believe for a single moment, the mere assertions or professions
of such a man as Jamis; can injure me, or entitle him to; his, or
their confidence, w-hen i t can be provided by incontrovertible authority, that, the interest he feels, in the execution of the duties of his
office, is entirely measured by the pecuniary advantages which he
derives by their exercise In case any of our ships should want large supplies, Lisbon would
be the most e'tigeable place in this quarter to furnish them; provided
we have an active Kavy Agent there

attentions have been paid to one of our publif: ships, than has been

DEARSIR, I sent off your Messenger last Evening, and nothing has

that be the case, I shall send him or some of the Servants to you, that
you may send them forward to the Bashaw if you think proper, as
they would be able to assure him, that you are on the spot waiting his
arnval. Should your messenger return without him, and you should find
it necessary to communicate with him again from where he is, I
should suppose it would be better to return here and wait an Answer,
and perhaps you will think with me, that the Brig had better return to
the Commodore as proposed before, should the Bashaw come down
with the Messenger, and have a number of Men about him I should
think you had better send and meet him, and fix on some spot at a
distance from Demanhour (say half a days journey) and let him come
with a few Men, and have an interview, as I am sure his bringing a
large number of Men near this place d l excite suspicions prejudicial
to us. Should the Bashaw not arrive, and you think with me that I had
better return, I will thank you to acquaint the Major, that hilt Gordon
may arrive here in time. f think with you that what has happened has been occasioned by
the French Commissary - yet it might be improper to charge him

SIR I n addition to my letter of the 26tQUltm?, I now have the
honor to inform you that t,he Constitution is ready for Sea, and will
Sail tomorrow, provided the sett,lement of her accounts does not
prevent. I n the last Gale, considerable damage was done to the shipping
here, and in which the Constitubion broke one of her bower Anchors
which has obliged me to get another in addition to the one already
mentioned in my letter of the 26th Ultm? The information I ave in my letter of the 30tQDecemr, and which
I received from the got, of the Brig Sirens having left t,his but a
few Days previous to my arrival, I have since found is incorrect;
as she has not been here at all: but it appears that in consequence
of the sickness at Gibraltar she has made Cadiz her rendezvous
generally. I have not procured quite so many Men here as I could have wished,
altho t.hose I have entered are generally h e fellows & such an additiop to the former crew, as to induce me to flatter myself, that I
shall be able to give you a very fair acct of the services of the Constitution next Summer - I have nothing at present farther to communicate, than that I shall call a t Tangier to learn how our affairs
stand in that quarter, and at Gibraltar to take as many of the Stores
from thence to Syracuse as I can conveniently Stow [NDA. captain'^ LB, Vol. 1, 1805.1

DEMANHOUR
Sunday dt@Febv 1806
DEARSIR, By express of yesterday I stated to you my arrangements concerning the two Ministers of Hamet Bashaw at Rosetta
although I have not yet received an Answer to my letter from this
place b~ the Arab Cheif - I am assured in pos~tiveterms by the
Kercheif of this Village that an Answer cannot be delayed more than
two da s longer - It would seem hardly possible that the Bashaw
would oose this oppertunity of an interview, but should it so happen
and my Messenger return without him I am entirely of opinion with
you, of the Brigs returning to the Randezvous, I have anticipated
$our Ideas concerning the impropriety of the Bashaws approaching
the Turkish frontiers with a force and have given instructions to
my Messenger to signify to him that he can advance with his suit
only which are not to consist of more than eight men, Am not confident he will yeild to these terms, for it appears his jealousy and
suspicions with these of his Turkish Brethren are reciprocal. 3 O.CLOCK
P. M. I had just turned this period in answer to your
letter when, when a messenger from Hamet Bashaw entered .my
appartment, and to convince me he was not an impostor he put lnto
my hands my first letter to Hamet Bashaw from Alexandria of 30tp
Novr this was a fortunate occurrence because it assured the Bashaw
of our high respect for the Grand Seignior and cautioned him agaiflst
any steps which might go to compromit our good intelligence m t h
that sovereign, and it having an Arabic translation on the back, 1
went with it to the Kercheif, who by the by is a fierce Savage Turk
but a good General. - this at once did away all suspicion, he took
me by the hand for the first time, conplimented my candour and
invited me to ride out and dine with him at his Camp, thls messenger
was followed by several Arabs who had kept in the back ground
'till they know whither they might enter with safety, accompanied
by the two Maltese whom I dispatched secretly from Calro, One

330

of the Arabs is a servant of the Bashaw and accompanied him on
his route towards this place as far as Fiune, he will be in Demanhour
tomorrow and Wednesday morning we shall set off for Alexandria
the Bashaw has only his suite with him consisting of about forty
Persons, which gives no uneasiness to the Kercheif, on the Contrary
he has voluntarily offered us an escort to secure our passage to
Alexandria and will go out himself with me tomorrow to accompany
our friend into Demanhour. I shall want a thousand dollars to clear out from this, and request
you will arrange the affair with Mr Briggs, so as to send them safely,
and if possible in Marboote this sum I hope and trust will put an
end to our expences of this sort, as i t certainly will to our danger &
anxiety if the hazard of sending cash, should be thou ht too great, must
pledge my credit with these people 'till I arrive wit you, on consideration I shall wait your answer to this express before I start from this
place. - I beg Sir you will accept my congratulations and assurance
of respect & Esteem.

Alexandria dt@Febr 1806
DEARSIB,Your letter of the 4t+ came to hand at 12 this day, but
owing to the Governors being engaged, we could not see him till nearly
four in the afternoon, when M' Briggs and myself called on him to
know what number of Men he would suffer to enter this Town with
you, he would not consent that more than three or four besides your
party should accompany you and the Bashaw, but a t same time
wished to consult the Admiral. M' Briggs and myself went with him
to the Admiral, who we found rather in a bad humour, after making
known to him our visit, he agreed with the Governor that three or
four men was as many as could be allowed to pass throu h the Gates
with you, but after talking the matter over and on our eaving him,
he consented to suffer six besides your party to pass the Cutt, and
said he would gire Orders to that effect to the Officer Commanding
at the Cutt. Should the Bashaw bring more men with him than the
eight you mentioned he had better leave them a t Demanhour until
you arri~ehere, and perhaps we shall be able to obtain permission
to get the whole of them on board - while M' Briggs and myself
were with the Governor, I had men out collecting small money to
send you. it ttp ears they have only collected five hundred dollars,
wbich I hope w' 1 Answer your present purposes, had they collected
more, I think the risque too great to send to the amount of One Thousand dollars by one Courier, should the five hundred not be sufficient,
I will send the remainder by another conveyance. - The Sword I

do not send for fear it might be an inducement for the Arabs to plunder
the Courier of both Sword and money.
11 O'Clock at Night. -

I sent M' O'Bannon on shore with the above Letter to M' Briggs
to be forwarded by the Courier, but i t appears that when he ot on
shore, that the Governor and admiral had sent for MT Briggs' 8mgoman to inform him that they had chan ed their minds, that although
they had consented to suffer Hamet ashaw to pass with six men,
that they would now not allow him to enter Ale~andria~without
theV~ce
Roys permission, and that they had sent off an express to the Vice
Roy, to know whether he would be allowed to pass - in short I
desired Mr OIBamon to state to you what passed at the Admirals
between him and M' Briggs.
I had forgot to mention to you, that
the Governor bad produced a Letter which he said was from the Vice
Roy, limiting the number of men to two or three, that were to be
allowed to enter Alexandria with the Bashaw, but it appears that Mr
Briggs offered to confine them to the Vice Roys Letter, but they
refused, so that it is possible, no such Letter has been sent from him. I am happy you have wrote the Vice Roy, and hope you will receive
a favourable answer, as you will then be before hand of the Courier
they have sent off, but I think it will be necessary to write him again,
to do away any difficulties they may make, or objection they may
state to the Bashaws learing this. - If you can place him in a situation
to be safe, it will be proper by all means, that you come to this place
as soon as possible, and bring with you the Vice Roys firman, and
such other Papers as you may have to do away the suspicions that
have gone out against us. If the Bashaw will not part with you, it may be well to send the
firman, by MK Blake or some safe conveyance, or if he will remain
with M' Blake, and let you come here, I have no doubt but we shall
be able to convince them, that we have conducted with upwrightness
and candour. - from what I have stated, you will perceive, that it
is necessarv something is done very soon You will be a little astonished to see so sudden a change in our
affairs,but we must be patient untill we can convince them that they
have been led away by intriegue,
Should any thing further happen, I shall take the earliest oppertunity to inform you. - I have not sent the Money as things have
taken such a change - I was fearful of the Couriers being stopt. You will see by the conversation that passed between the Captain
Bey, and A$! Brlggs in the presence of M' O'Bannon, that he IS .no
friend of the Bashaws, as he said that nothing but a fear of offendng
the English and American Governments prevented him from talung
him by the Beard, and trampling him under his feet. - M' Briggs
gave him to understand, that he was the American Consul as well as
the English, and that he must be cautious, how he interfered &"
1
should think it will be well, that he is cautious, and keep a good look
out, as they appear to act in direct contradiction to the Vice R O ~ S
Orders, or they must have received a Counter Order or firman slnce
YOU left Cairo, perhaps it would not be amiss to write to the Governor
of this place, and inform him of your situation $ 9 -

SIR Actuated by a sincere respect for your opinion, and presuming
on your friendship; I am induced to solicit your attention to the
Intimations w3ich Mh JarviS may make to the Sect? of State, respecting a dispute which happen'd between us during the stay of the
Constitution in this Port - I should not consider this request necessary; had I the least reason to consider M: Jarvis an honorable man,
but on the contrary, and knowing him to be malicious; I am induced
to fear that an unjust representation might tend to, injure a character
which I hold next in estimation to the salvation of my soul, in the
opinion of Goverment The respect which I feel for the high authority that placed M'
Jarvis here was sdllcient inducement to prevent m taking such steps,
as to prove by document, that he has forfeited t e trust deposed in
him by his overment; as such a proceding could not fail to injure
him in his o cia1 capacity; and of course the Interest of his country however you may rest assured, that when such process shall be consider'd necessary, I can and will prove to the satisfaction of dl concern'd; that his conduct, as relates to myself has been derogatory to
the character of a Gentleman; and to his goverment such as will not
admit a single ray of doubt that he has forfited their confidence

that we wished an enterview with him, we found that he was a sleep
and could not be seen 'till Three O'clock, at which time u-e waited
on him to come to an explanation about last nights conduct, we
found him as fearful as ever, and pretended he had received a Letter
last night from the Vice Roy, forbidding any of the Party's returning
to this place, until further Orders, and that he was receiving Letters
from Demanhour, every moment, some stating that the Bashaw had
a number of men dressed in Mameluke dress, others that he has with
him Sixty or Seventy Men, and five or six hundred, not far distant.
from Demanhour - in fact there seems to be a general alarm, and ji
fear we have not as yet seen the worst of it, for it is impossible to sa
how far these peoples fears may carry them, but a short time I hope w' 1
determine - After a little warm conversation with the Governor,
he left us in a very great passion, and went to the Admirals, after
stopping a few moments, Mc Briggs and myself left the house. After this statement you will easily perceive that you must rest
quiet, until you receive Answers from the Vice Roy to your Letters I hope you have made statements to him, that will counteract any
falsehoods from this place. - I beg Sir, that you will take such
measures, as will prevent our having any difÂ£iculty with this Government, or involving our friends. Should you have had an interview with the Bashaw, and find him
determined to go by land, I should suppose your arrangements might
be made as well a t or near Demanhour as a t thls place, therefore it
would not be necessary for him to come here, but should you determine to come on board, I see no other way than your fixing on some
place to the Westward, where he may be taken off, as I should suppose there would be no risk in doing that whilst he holds the Vice
Roys pass, unless he should give Counter Orders, either this must be
done, or you must remain untill you can get a firman from the Vice
Roy, that he may embark from this place. -

DEARSIR, All is well! I have not seen Cap: H. but have been an
hour with the Governor and Admiral, they have reason on their side,
you have had an incorrect translation of the firman - be assured Sir,
it expressly says that Hamet Bashaw may approach Rosetta or Alexandria, it is then necessary, that the Commanders in either place
should have an order directed particularly to them from the Vice Roy
to pass him. The Admiral and Governor have dispatched a Courier
asking that, and by return they solemnly declare it will give them
infinite pleasure to receive him with proper honours, that our real
friend tne Kercheij of Demanhour may not suspect our h a ~ i n gdirected him (as he naturally will suppose from this arrestation) You
can inform him that the Admiral and Governor both, in presence of
Messr? Briggs 0.Bannon and myself, that he had been perfectly correct after having recelved the Vice Roys Order, and that they only
waited the same. I t is the opinion of Mr Briggs, and I think with him, that you had
better Camp a t Bricket, the communication will be easy with you,
and I am sure more agreeable than Demanhour - At Bricket you
are surrounded with friends in case of necessity - I am confident
however they will not be needed - Pardon the liberty I take to

and if it is his determination to proceed by land I do not see the necessity of his coming here perhaps you can make your arrangements at
or near Demanhour and by appearances, the sooner i t is done the better for fear of a Counter Order. - You perhaps had better fix on
some piace near Derne for us to meet him, at a stated time (say two
rnont*hs)at such place as he may name, and you will b o w what the
Commodore authorised us to say to h i , if he is confident he can go
down near Derne, he may be sure we shall be there at the time
appointed by you. From the obstinacy of the Governor and Caps Bey, I fear they are
trying to delay the business as much as possible, in hopes to receive
Counter Orders from the Vice Roy. -it will be necessary for you
to write to the Vice Roy, and state to him the manner in which they

SIR I have the honor to acquaint you that the two gun boats
built at this city, were launch,d one on the 4t* and one on the Gth inst.
That from the uncommon severity of the weather, and quantity of
Ice in the river, they could not safely be launch,d a t the time mentioned
in my last of the l g t @Jan?.
The Ice yet continues to impede their conveyance to the Navy
wharf, where they will be taken when it can be done with safety &
will progress in their equipment.
I have further to inform that those boats have been built of thc most
durable materials, and the workmanship faithfully executed, the plan
and dimensions have been followed in every instance and they meet
the most sanquine expectations in their buoyance and stiffness on the
water; their further qualities can be better Judge,d when completely
equipp,d
Should it be contemplated to establish a superin tendan t of Naval
affairs a.t this port for the ensuing summer, in the care and management
of the Gun boats now built or in the building of others, I have presumed the establishment if myself should be deern,d qualified (or

SIR A letter of tbis date from Cap9 Hull will inform you, what
transpired during an interview, yesterday morning with the Admiral
and Governor of Alexandria, and last evening when I was with M'
Briggs. His droga.man entered and informed him that the Governor
& admiral had sent for him some time previous, and informed him,
that they had upon reconsideration, altered their opi~ionsof permitting Hamet Bashaw to enter Alexandria, without further orders from
the Vice Roy of Cairo Mr Briggs did not wait to enquire the cause of this sudden change,
and I accompanied him to the Admirals house, where we expected
to find the Governor, but in this we were disappointed - however
M' Briggs did not fail to tax the Admiral, with a want of Firmness,
and sincerity, in changing so suddenly - and without any apparent
cause - This could only be answered, by pretending a dread of not

meeting the Vice Roys approbation, in acting without his direct
order Mr Briggs finding that remonstrance was in vain, and no argument
could prevail in favour of Hamet's coming to this place; is of opinion
that you will do well in loosing no time to procure positive orders from
Courskeck Bashaw, or in proceeding to this place immediately with
the original b a n , which he thinks will be sufficient to satisfy a set
of ignorant commanders, who have nothing to recommend them but
power, and who are obstinately determined not to let Hamet enter,

a reexamination My respects to Mess* Mann & Blake

SIR Since I had the honor of writing you the First Instant, the
Building of the Gun Boat a t this place has progressed but slowly,
owing to bad Weather. The Master Shipwright assures me however
that She will be Launched a t or near t'he next change of the Moon.
The variation which has been made in regard to the Building of this
TTessel, by the direction of Mr Wm Smith, from the original plan,
meets m full and entire approbation, as well as others who have seen
her on t e Stocks and who are I believe pretty competent Judges;
the most msterial alterations of which I speak are; three feet more
Beam; one Foot Nine Inchcs more hold; The Bilge peices or Keels
about Ten feet longer; (inside of the Vessel and opposite to them)
the Cieling Plank instead of being only TWOIn: thick, are three
Inches; through which last and the Bilge peices besides the ordin
security, d l be driven composition Bolts, and riveted inside, and whc
are to pass through every other Floor Timber; this in my estimation
will make the outer Keels doubly secure. and as a further alteration
from the ori al plan a shoring will be put on to the Bottom of the
Main Keel ( hree Inches thick) which I much approve of - as the

fi

"E

338

NAVAL OPERATIONS FRO.ii 1804 TO 1805

Vessel will in consequence of it when under way and plying to the
Windward hold a better 'VC'ind; taking all these alterations into one
point of view as they vary from the original plan and I am decidedly
of the opinion that the Vessel when finished will be all the better for
the Public Service. Her Frame is an excellent one; and the best I
ever saw in a Vessel of her size; her other materials are also very good;
her Deck plank instead of Two Inches thick, are Two & 5 in thickness,
very long, clear of Sap, and Shakes; The plank on the Bottom are
also free from the two East; And both the Deck and Bottom plank are
of the best of Yellow Pine, which are generally esteemed more durable
than white oak. hfr IT. Smith was here a few days past and informed
me that the Vessel (mentioned in this communication) is to carry one
Gun only of a large Calibre; If this is correct, I t is a pitty it had not
been known here some days sooner especially before her Deck was
Framed; which would have saved expence in time, Timber &c. But
since the Deck is framed and keeping in view that She was to carry
according to the o r i e a l plan one Cannon of large Calibre a t each
End; I am Sorry that I t has been thought expedient to depart from
that plan; submitting to your consideration the following reasons
with all deference to your better Judgment. Because the Vessel in
Question is sufficiently Strong Built enough & Burdensome to carry
one Thirty Two pounder at each End; Because at both extremities
her Deck has been equally well secured with Timber, plank, and Iron,
for carrying Two such heavy Guns. Because agreeable to the Method
of Sparing, Rigging, & Sailing of her; as is now directed to be done
having a Rudder a t each End, and to advance one way the same as
the other, I t results from this, that She ought to have one Gun a t
Each End. Because having Two Guns She will be more formidable
strike more dread upon an Enemy & will be in my opinion more
serviceable to the public in any onset, or attack upon which She may
hereafter be ordered.
However if it is determined that She is to mount but one heavy
Cannon at one End, I beg I may be permitted to give directions to
have 3lounted Two Guns, Four or Six pounders a t the other End,
with a few Swivels, or Cow Horns; having had no directions from the
Kavy Department how the Cannon a t one or both Ends of the Vessel
are to be mounted; and hearing &I: Smith Say he did not expect
any from that Quarter; M' P. Pritchard, and myself, have fallen
upon a plan and which we are confident will answer that end better
than any other plan, which perhaps has hitherto been addopted
in this Country; which is upon Two Circles the under one to be
secured to the Deck, the upper part of which to form a Water
level and upon it to have a plate of Iron: The upper Circle to traverse
all round upon Brass Sheeves fixed in the outer part of s'J Circle; which
will run upon the Iron plate of the under Circle. The upper Circle,
in the Centre of which to have an Iron Saucer in which an Iron pivot
is to play, which will project from the Kelson through the Deck, and
the lower Circle being will secured the upper End of which being
taper'd away so as to have sufficient play in the Saucer, - upon the
End of this Iron pivot, and a Number of brass Sheeves fixed as above
observed, & the weight of the Cannon and its two Carriages (one of
which to be secured to the upper Circle, the other to slide backwards
& forwards upon the one which is fixed to the upper Circle) this

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS

last, will be turned with facility with the aid of a Couple of Men in
any direction and the Cannon will have a t least Nine feet recoil.
This is the outlines of our plan; should it meet your approbation
please to notify me of i t by the return of post. otherwise you will have
the goodness to give directions to Mr W. Smith in what manner the
Gun or Guns ere to be mounted on board of the said Vessel.
I hare been thus particular in my duty relative to the Gun Boat
Building here (by consent of Mr Smith) whose duty I told him I did
not wish to interfere in; and who said he wished me to inform you the
particulars now communicated to you.

advise Captain Hull to go to Aboukir with the brig.
The sheik, El Belled, is a t the home of Captain Vincenzo and is
ready to go with me as soon as we know where to meet you, if by
any chance we are not able to find you in Alexandria the above mentioned person swears he does not have the intention of which he is
accused by the secretary and affirms all the charges are false. Up to
this time I have not received either the horse or the sailor, I continue
to look for it but do not find anything good.

I find to 250,000 Spanish Dollars, and I have every reason to believe

Naval Stores in England, as the remittances to Lisbon was

such Gold in England; he in consequence has authorised the House
of Messrs Buckley & CQof Lisbon, to write to London to ascertain
which will be most advantageous, to carry the Gold to England, or
to purchase Bills with it a t Lisbon: and when I left Lisbon (loth Ins:)
he was waiting the result.
At Lisbon there is only one Frigate of 30 Guns and her Prize a
Prusian Merchant Brig, with a Brig pierced for 16 Guns, which they
have purchased and are now fitting for a Cruizer - There is a Frigate of 30 Guns & another of 20 Guns a t St Ubes, the one of 30 Guns
is ready for Sea, and i t is said is watching the motions of a large
Prusian merchant Ship in that Port. Application has been made to

said that he has since been endeavouring to charter a Merchant Vessel

SIR, The letters which have passed between Captain Ed1 and

I had the honor to address you on the 13th December, convey a
detail of our transactions since that date - The apprehensions I
then entertained of impediments on the part of the Mameluke Beys
were just - The Bashaw seperated himself from them with his
suit immediately on receiving my first letter from Cairo, and repaired
to Fiaum a neutral province; but the evening of his departure thirty
Arab chiefs were put in chains by the mameluke Osman Bey Berdici
to prevent their following him with their tribes - Of four copies
of the Vice Roy's letter of Amnesty which I dispatched by different
conveyances not one reached him - Three 3laltees in disguise of
Arabs, charged with one of them, entered the hlameluke camp; were
arrested; the packet taken from them and they sentenced to death:
They intoxicated the sentinel who was an European renegade, and
escaped to Fiaum; by whom the Bashaw obtained the first infor-

mation of that act of grace; and it was not till he joined me at Demanhour that he first saw the letter - This has delayed our measures
& given us embarrassments - My three enterprizing Maltees are with
me but we have no returns from any of the other three couriers We left Demanhour last tuesday and arrived a t the English cut
between Aboukir bay and lake Mareotis the day following; where
we were arrested by a Turkish guard and forbid to enter the City. This comes from the French Consul - He had been before me in
gaining the Turkish admiral (here is but one way of access to these
people;) who, considering himself chiefly charged with the safety of
the city and harbor, & not admitting the jurisdiction of the Vice Roy
to extend be ond low water mark, absolutely refused admission into
the City to fIamet Bashaw, or permission to us to embark him a t
this place - The french Consul excuses himself for this intrigue,
as he does also for the open indignity he has offered our flag, by saying his "Zeal for the interest of the Emperor will justify his conduct,
and save him from reproach". This goes in support of an opinion
Commodore Preble had formed from his intercourse with the French
Consul of Tripoli, that "the intervention of the Emperor in our
behalf covers a design; or that his Agents on this coast have used
an unwarrantable discretion". But this impediment does not stop
our progress - The Bashaw had already determined to take the
desert of Lybia to Derne; giving for his reason, which I think a
sound one that by taking shipping and seperating himself from the
Arabs, they would loose patience if not confidence also and abandon
his cause - He has consiquently moved round the lake and will
to morrow take his station a t Arabs' town thirty miles Westward
of the old port of Alexandria; where I am to join him with a detachment from the City next Sunday and proceed with him to Bomba
at the head of five hundred men and there take post. Meantime
Captain H d repairs to the rendevous for suitable reenforcements
and supplies to secure an establishment at Derne and Bengazi Those provinces in our possession will cut off from the enemy and
turn into our own channel a source of provisions; and will open a
free intercourse with the interior of the country - I have requested
of the Commodore, for this purpose, an hundred stand of Arms with
catridges and two brass field pieces with trains and Amunition; and
also a detachment of one hundred Marines, if necessary, to load a
coup d.e main. I calculate the whole expenditure of cash in this
expedition, including expences in Egypt, will amount to Twenty thousand dollars - Further disbursements and supplies will be necessary to carry the plan into final effect. But to indemnify the United
States I have entered into a convention with Hamet Bashaw to
pledge the Tribute of Sweden, Denmark and the Batavian Republic; which convention I shall reduce to writin and forward by Captain Hull if time permit; otherwise by the ear iest occasion.
Day before yesterday an envoy arrived in a ketch from Joussuf

express purpose of prevailing on them to stop Hamet Bashaw from

by a resident a t Malta known by the sobriquet, I1 Conte Gdlini

agent made great promises, in the name of his master, to these Turkish

commanders. But perceiving they seemed not to have full faith in
his assurances, he resorted to the sensibility of their compassion said, ij Hamet Bashaw was permitted to return Joussuj must jly the
kingdom or loose his head. The subjects oj Tripoli were getting weary
of the war with these new Infidels; they could not learn from their movements, their intentions, and were attacked unaware: The Bashaw beleived
he could resit them upon his batteries - but ij they made a descent with
his brother, his people would all leave him.
This statement comes from the private Secretary of the Governor
who is secured in our interest, and who heard the cause of of Joussuf
Bashaw argued before the Governor and admiral I don't learn what
effect i t has taken: but if the client has not the means of touching a
more sensible nerve than a turk's pity his case is forlorn - at any
rate we are secured against his influence by the secure position we have
taken - Except therefore some unforseen accident thwart us, my
next will be dated a t Bengazi - The Arabs and Moors are universally with us; and if we had the means of subsistence, we might march
twenty or thirty thousand from the borders of Egypt, who from time
to time have taken refuge here since the usurpation of Joussollf Bashaw. - Messr@Briggs, Brothers, have furnished us with ten thousand dollars; for three thousand of which Captain Hull has drawn bills
on London the balance I have receipted and reported to the commander in cheif; who will undoubtly refund it out of the funds appropriated to this service - I have promised the Vice Roy of Egypt
the sword I saved from the arms sent out to Tunis - I had not any
other resort to satisfy his expectations and I hope the President will
approve the measures we have thus far pursued.

We left Demanhour last Thursday and arrived at the English Cut,
between Aboukir Bay and lake Moeriotis, the day following; where
we were arrested by a Turkish Guard, and forbid to enter the City.
This comes from the French Consul. He had been before me in gaining the Turkish Admiral: (there is but one way of access to these people:) who, considering himself chiefly charged with the safety of the
city and harbor, and not admitting the jurisdiction of the Vice Roy
to extend beyond low water mark, absolutely refused admission into
the city to Hamet Bashaw, or permission to us to embark him a t this
place. The French Consul excuses himself for this intrigue, by saying
his zeal for the interest of the Emporer, will justify his conduct and
save him form reproach.
This goes in support of an opinion Commodore Preble had formed
from his intercource with the French Consul of Tripoli, that "the intervention of the Emperor in our behalf, covers a design; or that his
agents on tbis coast have used an unwarrantable discretion". But

this impediment does not stop our progress. The Bashaw had already determined to take the desert of Lybia to Derne; giving for his
reason, which I think a sound one, that by taking shipping and separating himself from the Arabs, they would lose patience if not confidence also, and abandon his cause. He has consequently moved round
the lake; and will tomorrow take his station at Arab's Tour, thirty
miles westward of the old post of Alexandria; where I am to join him
with a detachment from the city next Sunday, and proceed with him
to Bomba at the head of five hundred men, and there take post.
Mean time Capt. Hull repairs to the rendesvous for suitable reinforcements and supplies, to secure an establishment a t Derne and Bengazi.
Those provinces in our possession will cut off from the enemy and turn
into our own channel, a source of provisions; and will open a free
intercourse with the inferior of the country. I have requested of the
Commodore for this purpose, an hundred stands of arms, with cartridges, and two fieldpieces with trains and ammunition; and also a
detachment of one hundred marines, if necessary, to lead a coup de
main. I calculate the whole expenditure of cash in this expedition,
including expences of Egypt, will amount to twenty thousand dollars.
Further disbursments and supplies will be necessary to carry this plan
into final effect. But, to indemnify the United States, I have entered
into a convention with Hamet Bashaw to pledge the tribute of Sweden,
Denmark and the Batavian Republic, which convention, I shall reduce to writing, and forward by Capt. Hull if time permit; otherwise
by the earliest occasion.

the Barbary Regenmee

ALEXANDBIA
Feb. 14.1806
SIR, The dispatches to the Secretaq of the Navy accompan
this, which I pass open through your hands, will exhibit a view o E
measures we have pursued, since our arrival in Egypt; and of the
actual situation of affairs in regard to a co operation with Hamet
Bashaw. For minute circumstances, which may be omitted in those
communications I bet to refer you to Captain Hull and the Gentlemen
under his command, who are witnesses to eve transaction which
has taken place with us - and also to collaterz original correspondencies has taken place & which I send ybu I calculate to leave this on Sunday and in two days after proceed
on our march with Hamet Bashaw to Bomba, by the desert; where,
it is hoped, we shall meet re enforcements and supplies suf3cient to
secure positions at Derne & Bengaze. This, we are of opinion, will
require two additional small vessels and a bomb - a gun boat also
would be usefull, if the navigation at this season should not be thought
too hazardous. Two brass field pieces (four pounders) with their
trains and Amunition, and one hundred stand of arms with cartridges
will be requisite; And, to place the success of the expedition beyond the
caprice of incident, one hundred marines with bayonets should be a t
hand to lead a Coup & Main in case of necessity - By the time we
shall have arrived, a t Bomba, I shall have disbursed about ten
thousand dollars, which we have taken upon credit of Messr~Bggs,
Brothers; for four thousand of which sum Captain Hull has drawn
bills on London and Malta; the balance we have promised, shall be
sent up in one of the small vessels. Ten thousand dollars more at
least will be necessary to accomplish our views on Derne & Bengazi The Bashaw aesures me he will be able immediately to refund these
sums when established in those provinces. And to indemnify the
United States for all expences arising out of a cooperation with him, he
pledges the tribute of Denmark, Sweden and the Batavian Republic in
case of recovering his throne; which may be calculated upon as a oertain event -if measures to that effect are supported by suitable energy
and address. He engages also to release to you, without Ransom,
Captain Bainbridge his officers, and all American prisoners who may
be in captivity at Tripoli - to stipulate with the United States a
permanent Peace without tribute and on the footing of the most
favored nation - He engages that in case of future War, Captives
shall be treated as prisoners and not as slaves, and subject to reciprocal exchange - He will surrender the enemy, with his family and
chief admiral into our hands, in case he does not escape by fight to be held as hostages - and he agrees to deliver up to you, if required,
all vessels of war which may or shall have been employed against the
United States by Joussuf Bashaw In consideration of the friendly offices of his majest the I(ing of
the two Sicilies towards the squadron of the United tat?, Hamet
Bashaw invites his Majesty to renew with him their ancient friendship;
and proffers to him a peace on the same footing as that to be stipulated
in his convention with the United States - If time and cirournstances
admit we shall reduce this convention to writing and forward copies by
Captain Hull; Otherwise it will be done at Bomba, - At the m t a -

tion of the Bashaw and his Divan, and in conformity to the sentiments
expressed to me by the Secretarg of the Navy, I have taken on myself
the command in chief of the Bashaws army and the direction of all
operations by land, And I cannot but flatter myself that we may
realize the success of our calculations on this coalition; and that you
will have the glory of carrying the ursurper a prisoner in Your Squadron to the United States; and of releiving our fellow citizens from the
chains of slavery without the degrading conditions of a ransom Lieut OBannon and M: Peck will Accompany the expedition to
Derne by land; and I request as a particular favor that you will
consent that Mr OBamon should continue with us with his command
of marines and that you will permit Lieut' Bainbridge to join us A company of christains, principally old soldiers, recruited on the spot,
at the head of whom I have placed a French commander of light
Artilery, will proceed with us to Bomba in order to take the field
pieces we expect there
They are engaged for the expedition only;
but they will be found useful during the continuance of hostilities P. S. I have promised the Vice Roy of Egypt the sabre I sated
from the arms sent out for the Bey of Tunis - I t is in the hands of
Colonel Lear - When the Colonel shall have been made acquainted
with the necessity of this engagement I cannot doubt that he will
send it forward by the vessel which comes up with Cash - I request,
Sir, you will give your approbation and influence to this measure

yet learnt from Cap! Stewart any thing in particular, relative to his
procedings since he has been on this station \iTiithii the last six Weeks the destruction in this Eay among the

I have call'd here to take such articles to Syracuse as are wanting at
that place, (Spars, Canvass kc)in case of the probable emergency's of
next Summer, and shall leave this the Instant my requisition is complied with, which will I am in hopes not take longer than two Days On my passage from Lisbon, we experienced some hard weather, which
gave me an opportunity of judging of the capacity of my present crew,
& I think I can with propriteysay, that after theyhareseen two Months
more ser~ice,they will be superior to any Crew I ever commanded. As I came into this Bay yesterday thirteen Spanish Gun Boats were
partially engaged with three British Ships (two Sloops of War and
a Frigate) however the Rinds falling light, the Ships were glad to
go off &- the Spaniards had not the resolution to pursue them; for if
they had, they might have taken the Ships, as it fell a perfect calm
in one hour after: particularly as the Frigate had, it is since said, not
more than one hundred blen. I am particularly anxious to get back to Syracuse again, as when
I left there Commodore Barron was in very bad health. P. S. The Emperors Ship Marboka mentioned in h/ir Simpsons

17 February 1805

[Syracuse] This morning the wind blew very fresh and fair for
Malta. At half past 9 o'clock got underway. At 11 o'clock we
were forced to put back, the wind coming ahead and delaying, and
a heavy sea. We came to anchor at half past 12 o'clook at noon.
The [space] gave orders to have 2 of the bullocks killed, which was
done and the quarters hung up to main stay to remain through the
night.

VENICEFebY lStb IS05
SIR I had the pleasure of addressing you under date of 27@ Jane
to which I must refer you for particulars respecting the U S Schooner
Enterprize, but as we proceed in her repairs and you consequently
must feel1 anxious to know our progress I feel a great pleasure in
executing that part of my duty. I have this day got her Bends on and her ceiling compleated. I was Obliged to put in a new Stem and Stern Post, in doing the
latter I have taken out the Square tuck and have also altered in a
small degree the fashion of her top sides, by not giving her so much
tumble home aloft, which will afford a better Deck and more room to
manage her Guns, but in every instance I have been particular in preserving her model below, that she ma continue to possess her good
qualities as a fast sailer and good sea oat I t astonishes me how her stern hung together, it was at &st a miserable piece of work and when we broke it down perfectly rotten. The schooner is as full as I think necessary of the best Timber I
ever saw, the Master Carpenter of the Arsenal says (and I think with
great reason) that she will be a good Vessel after this repair forty
years. Oh! how I wish I had got permission to give her a few feet more
Keel and opened her a little what a sweet Brig I would have made
her, and with no apparent exTence, but Sir it is dangerous for Officers
young in rank to take libertys. Commodore Barron gave me a letter of credit on the house of S C
Holland & CQf Trieste for the expence of repairs &c, through the
concern of Ross & C? Malta
I perceived the irregularity of this arrangement and the loss of at
least one commission to the U S (which the house in Malta must be
paid) when eventually the fund must be in London, Leghorn or Naples
and having the power to draw from here on those places direct there
is great advantages to be taken of the Exchange. I therefore immediately communicated my sentiments to Commodore Barron and have received his answer authorizing me to draw on
our Agents at Leghorn or Naples or on Glennie & MqKenzie London.
I shall take whatever advantages may offer in favour of the U, S,
as respects the Exchange on those places, and in every other instance
you may rely on my Attention to the interest and honour of my
Country. -

I can say but little yet what the expences of the Schooner will be,
but Timber is not high and carpenters wages is not more for the best
workmen than half a dollar per day, Others in proportion, Their best
sail duck about the same as the English, cordage reasonable, and Iron
work much more so than with us in fact it is a fine place for the convenience of repairs &c. I think it will prove by far the most reasonable
in those Seas.
I have never been more hurt in my feelings as an American than
since my arrival in the Adriatic, how egregiously sir, our Government
is imposed on b some Consuls on the Continent of Europe, there is
scarcely an ~ n ~ f s h m ahere
n that has not in possession an American
Passport, and most of them never saw America; these are Obtained
by some rascally means for the purpose of passing through that part
of Italy possess'd by the French, and a designing man might under
the character [of an American] do S n i t e injury to a Belligerent
[power] with whom we are at peace and perhaps on terms of warm
frrendship. This information is a little out of my sphere of duty but I hope you
will excuse the libert when I offer my feelings as an American. Please forward to
R. the inclosed and if you would condecend
to write her a few lines consoleing her by the prospects of our return
&c &c
(for I was only to be absent one year) you would add greatly
to the many obligations I with pleasure acknowledge. -

Consul, Tripoli

TRIPOLIIN BARB?Feb? 18th 1806
DEARSIR, Not till the 6th inst. had I the pleasure to receive your
favor of the 6th ult. this displeases me so much more, as I have been
in the case to draw upon you several Bills of exchange payable in
Spanish Dollars, not being informed till now of your desire in that
respect. Give me however leave, Dr Sir, to observe to you, that it
will be impossible for me to draw Bills upon Tunis payable in Mahboobs at 4%, Tunis Piast:, as nobody will here give money to such an
exchange, and that when Bills are drawn payable in Tunisian Piastres;
a Spanish Dollar or Coin of the Country to the amount thereof is
valued at 4. T: Piast., which certainly is about 6. pro Cent dearer,
than their price a t Tunis notwithstanding that the price has been
extremely high. Capt. Bainbridge was in the necessity about a year
ago to draw upon you Sir, at such a price. I t appears to me likewise
that if a sum of Sp. D o l l w a s lodged with you for the Service
of the American Prisoners of war in Tripoli, it would be the most
convenient way, as any change in their price at Tunis would,
if not be indifferent a t least not occasion any loss; and at Malta the
Spanish Dollars certainly must lower in price by the same reason as
the price is increased in Tunis.
I now, however hope that Capt. Bainbridge is furnished with funds
for some time & that in the interval some change or other can take
place for the better. With respect to the Bill of exchange of Sidi
Hamida, I don't think, that there has been any real loss by the delay
of payment, because had the payment been effected in due time,
Capt. Bainbridge, would not have made use of some favourable oppor-

tunities to procure funds b Bills directly upon Malta, & would therefore now have been oblige to draw greater Sums upon ou; as to me,
it is indifferent whom I pay to you Sir, to Capt. Bain ridge, or the
Bashaw.
N. B. I send you a letter from Capt. Bainbridge, to the Secretary
of the NavySympathetic inkDr SIR,MT Holck, will tell some news I have wrote him in Danish.
The Bashaw is now very attentive upon your transactions with his
brother in Alexandria - a Camp is going against Derne. - The
Bashaw's Agent at Malta Gaetano Schembry, endeavours to persuade
the Bashaw, that by very hard treatment of the Captif Officers, he
might force his terms of peace; hitherto Schembry has not entirely
succeeded but he may. Give me leave to tell you that I found your
plan with the Bashaw's brother very vaste, & that you Sacrifice your
prisoner's life here in case of success -

"By the Presideni, which sails for America in a few da.ys, I embrace

me to write you as lengthy as I could wish; I will, however, give you
a short account of our journey across the L y b i ~ nDesert, where we
suffered almost every thing possible, hut in the end gained a glorious
victory, and in a great measure contributed to the bringrng the

we sailed from Malta, bound to Egypt (having on board, as passenger,
William Eaton, esq) in search of Hamet Bashaw, the rightful soverelgn of Tripoli, to endeavor to effect rt. cooperationwith hlm againat
his brother, the reigning Bashaw of Tripoli. We arrived at the port

362

NAVAL OPEEATIONS FROL%?1804 TO 1805

of Alexandria on the 24th Nov. and Mr. Eaton went to grand Cairo
in search of the ex-Bashaw, After a long series of difficulties, dangers and vexations, Mr. Eaton arrived near Alexandria with the Bashaw, and about 40 persons in his suit, about the 6th of February.
Mr. E. returned on board, and the Bashaw formed his camp 11 miles
from Alexandria, where he was occasionally reinforced by the Bedouin
or Desert Arabs. At the pressing solicitation of Mr. Eaton, and at
the request of capt. Hull, I consented to accompany the former across
the desert, with the proviso of joining the brig at Bomba. On the
19th of Feb. Mr. E. our lieutenant of marines, myself, and seven
marines, left the brig and joined the army, and the brig sailed for
Syracuse. On the 6th of March we commenced our march with about
300 well mounted Arabs, 70 christians recruited at Alexandria, and
105 camels, laden with our provisions and baggage. Our 1st day's
march was near 40 miles. On encamping, we found the well, to all
appearance, dry, and there was no water within 6 hours' march.
Here commenced the first of our sufferings-after marching near 40
miles in a burning sun, buoyed up with the idea of finding water at
the end of our march, we found on encamping, not the least sign of
water, nor was a green thing to be seen. All hands were employed
in clearing out the well, but were so thirsty and fatigued they could
hardly move. For myself, not having taken the precaution to procure a small skin of water to carry on my horse, had it not been for
a few oranges I had, I should hardly have been able to move next
morning. I laid myself down on my bed to sleep, but I could not,
being for the first time in my life almost dead with thirst. Had I
possessed thousands I would have given them for a gill of water.
About day light, a little water was found, worse, if possible than bilge
water; but to me it was more delicious than the most precious cordial
We moved on the 8th and continued our march, by irregular stages,
until the 22d, halting wherever water was to be procured, and frequently suffering very much for the want of it; our only provisions
a handful of rice and two biscuits a day, and every day perplexed and
harrassed by the Arabs for money, who finding us in their power,
endeavored to extort every thing from us. The 22d about noon, we
encamped on a spacious barren plain, where there were about 5000
Bedouin Arabs encamped, all in our interest, about 10,000 camels
and 50,000 sheep fed. Here we remained 5 days to refresh our troops.
The 27th we commenced our march with a small reinforcement, consisting of 37 Arab families, with about 150 fighting men. We might
have taken the whole of them, had we had a svfficiency of provisions,
which were now reduced to rice only.-Water was growing more and
more scarce every day, and the Arabs becoming more troublesome.
They seemed determined not to proceed to Bomba until news came
of the arrival of our vessels, never once supposing they would arrive,
but remained under an idea that we wished to get possession of some
strong hold in their country, and reduce them to christianity. They
said it was impossible for a christian and a mussulman to have the
same interest. Our provisions were drawing to an end, and our
christian soldiers on the point of mutinying. Our prospects were now
gloomy indeed, when, on the 10th of April, a t the time when we had
discovered a mutiny, a courier arrived with news of our vessels being
off Bomba. I n an instant the face of things changed from pensive
gloom to enthusiastic gladness; the soldiers who had refused to mount

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS

363

guard returned to their duty. The next morning we marched on in
high spirits, being only three good days march from Bombay, although
we had only provisions for the next da . The 12th, our provisions
being expended, we killed a camel for su sistence, which lasted us the
13th. On the 16th we arrived a t Bomba, having been 3 days without
a mouthful of provision, except a little sorrel we found now and then,
and a small root we dug out of the sand. To add to our distress,
no vessel was to be seen, and no water to be found; we remained that
night without a drop. The Arabs again began to murmur. Early
on the morning of the 17th I was roused by the joyful sound of a
sail! a sail! I went out of my tent, and enjoyed the pleasing sight of
the A ~ g wcoming down the coast under full sail. All was now rejoicing, and mutual congratulation. About 8 the Argus discovered us,
and a t 10 I enjoyed the pleasure of embracing my messmates, and
sitting down to a comfortable meal, which I had not enjoyed for near
40 days. When I think on our situation in the Desert, where no
other christian ever sat his foot, and consider what thieves the Arabs
are, who would shoot a man for the buttons on his coat, and their
relqgous prejudices, which mould have been sufficient to warrant our
deaths, as christians and enemies to their religion, I frequently wonder how i t was possible for us to succeed in reaching Bomba. Certainly it was one of the most extraordinary expeditions ever sat on
foot. We were very frequently 24 hours witbout water, and once 47
hours without a drop. Our horses were sometimes three days without, and for the last 20 days had nothing to eat except what they
picked out of the sand. The country was a melancholy desert throughout, and for the space of 450 miles we saw neither house nor tree, nor
hardly any thing green, and, except in one place, not a trace of a
human being.
"To-morrow morning we sail again for Alexandria. I have but a
few minutes to spare from my duty to finish this. Suffice it to say,
that on the 27th of April, Derne, the most valuable province of the
kingdom of Tripoli was taken by the united forces of Hamet Bashaw
and Mr. Eaton, and the Argw, Nautilus, and sloop Hornet; and that
about the middle of June a peace was concluded with the reigning
Bashaw of Tripoli; and the Ex-Bashaw, with about 60 of his followers,
obliged to abandon their country, without knowing where to seek a
home or subsitence. There is not the smallest doubt but that our
getting possession of Derne was the reason of the Bashaw's co*ng
to terms. But I must hasten to conclude, as a boat is now waiting
to take the letters on shore. Our whole squadron is at Syracuse, and
will go down the Mediterranean in a short time. The President sails
for America shortly. Commodore Barron is on board her in a very
low state of health. The John Adams and three gun boats have
arrived a t Syracuse."

New York b6tQFebruuy 1805
SIR, I had the Honor of writing you from Syracuse on the 16tQ
of September last, since which time I have been immediately under
the Orders of Commodore Preble, who I presume has kept you informed of our Movements since that Period.
We left Syracuse on the gt@ of October for Malta and arrived the
Day following where we discharged the remainder of the Stores:
Ballasted the Ship and waited untill the 4t@of November for Commodore Preble, on which Day I sailed, with him, and M: Randolph
on board for Syracuse, where I arrived the next Day. - sail'd on
the Ist?' for Messina, arrived on the lgt@- sail'd the 21" for Palermo.
arrived on the 2gth- sailed for Naples the Is! of December arrived on the Gt9 in the Evening, it then blowing hard from the
Southward anchored with both Bowers in 12 Fathoms Water, and
veered 60 Fathoms on the Larboard and 30 on the Starboard and
brought up, struck lower Yards and top Gt Mast
At 10 P. M. parted the Starboard Bower, let go the Sheet Anchor,
and veered on both Cables untill the Ship's Stem was in the Breakers
and then brought u struck Top Masts, and got top Gallant Masts
on Deck - from t&s Time untill Daylight we lay with extreme
Anxiet , expecting every Moment to art and go onshore - At
6 A. M? sent a Boat on board of H. B. h?Ship Renown which lay near
us for Assistance which was handsomely granted, by sending hls own
Boat with Cables and an Anchor which they dropped three Cables
Length to Windward of us and gave the End of the Cable on board.
We also very soon got Assistance from the Naval Arsenal, which also
sent off a new 19 In. Cable, bent to a heavy Anchor which they let
go three Cables' Lengths to Windward and gave us the End of a
10 Inch Cable which was bent to the large One, the Wind moderating,
we before Night hove off into a safe Situation and moored with the
Anchors and Cables sent us. On heaving up our two Anchors that
we were riding by (the Sheet and Bower) we to our utter Astonishment found them both broke off in the Shanlr. The Anchors are
American Manufactory and the worst I ever saw; what prevented
the Ship's going on shore God only knows. We the Next Morning

374

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1804 TO 1806

fished for, and got the Starboard Bower Anchor which we parted
from the evening of the 6@.
Commodore Preble tryed every Means to purchase an Anchor for
the Ship, but could only procure one of about eighteen hundred
Weight, and was obliged to take Cable with it as they would not
part with one without taking both - the Cable is a New one of
14 Inches but not fit for us. The Commodore procured the Loan
of an Anchor from theNeapolitan Government, which is to be returned
to Messina or Palermo with those two Anchors and the one we got
at Malta we were obliged to sail with; and are aJl the Anchors that
we have got at this Time, we were obliged to take the 19 Inch Cable
from the Neapolitan Government after riding by it. We sailed from
Naples for Gibralter on the 23s Decr and arrived on the 5th of January; Watered and provisioned the Ship and sailed on the gt+ for the
United States. On the gth sent our Boat on shore a t Tangier for
M' Simpson's Dispatches and in the Evening took our Departure
from Cape Spartell. On the 13th Instant discovered that between
two and three Thousand Gallons of Water had leaked out, owing
to the Badness of the Casks. Put all Hands on a short Allowance
of Water.
On the 226 after experiencing very severe Weather and the Wind
constantly prevailing from the Westward the Ship very Crank and
short of Water, Commodore Preble gave me an Order to proceed to
the Nearest Port, and recommended this; bore up for it accordingly
and got a pilot on Board on the 24tQand arrived here last Night,
where I shall wait your Orders. shall water the Ship tomorrow and
be ready to proceed for the Eastern Branch in one Hour after I receive
your Orders to do so.
If the Ship should be fitted for Service again, she wants to be corked
throughout, outside and in, two Bower Anchors of 32 Cwt each,
three Boats a Suit of Sails Complete, two Topsail Yards, One Top Gt
Mast, a Number of Water Casks and about three Tons of Cordage
assorted, exclusive of her Stores for the Cruize
I forward you a Muster Book by which you will perceive the State
of our Crew, and the great Number of Changes that have taken
Place. The Supernumeraries were sent on Board by Order of Commodores Barron and Preble with the seven Prisoners of War.
The Men whose Time of Service has not expired would be an Acquisition to any Vessel1 fitting for Service I have been obliged to take up from Commodore Preble ten Thousand nine Hundred Dollars for the Purchase of Anchors, Cables,
advances to Officers, and other Expences for the Ship and for which
I have receipted to him for [KDA. MC LB, 1804-5.1

WASHINGTON
Feb. 28. 1805
SIR I have been informed that the young Gentleman who was
lately engaged in a Conflict with a very near Relation of mine, a t
Syracuse, in which the latter unfortunately fell, is now confined on
ship board, a t Norfolk, and that it is contemplated to bring him to
Trial under that Article for the Government of the Navy, which
prescribes the Punishment for Murder To you I need not say that however reprehensible the Practice of
duelling may be, yet the wisest Legislators and the most able Magistrates, have for some hundred years, in vain endeavoured to check
i t - It is one of those Evils which is consequent upon Society. It
and most frequently proceeds from the noblest feeling of the Heart.
Before i t can be stopped, the State of Society itself must change,
and till then, human Laws, and human Punishments will be vain.
But if the Executive should think differently from me in this particular, permit me to ask if the first Instance of severe Punishment
should be directed to a Boy, who may have been led to the Commission
of his offence by the too prevalent Example of older, wiser and more
exalted men than himself, and who perhaps a t the Moment conceived
his own Life or that of his adversary a necessary sacrifice to his
Reputation.
I have conversed with Lieutenant Izard on the subject and from
him have learn'd that no doubt can exist as to the fairness of the
Duel. If I know the Family to which I belong, to every Member of
whom our young and amiable Relation was deservedly dear, I am
persuaded that under these circumstances Mr Dehart's [*] Pardon
would be infinitely more grateful to them than his Punishment. However sensibly we may all feel the Loss we have sustained, I trust we
could none of us suffer any Portion of Resentment to mingle itself
with our Regret.
As a member therefore of the same family, as one attached to the
deceased by the warmest Affections, I venture respectfully to ask
that Mr Dehart may be forgiven, and that hereafter he may be considered as though this unfortunate Event had never happened. In
making this request I do no more for this young Gentleman, whose
Person and connections are entirely unknown to me, than I should
have expected from his Friends, had my Relation been the survivor JOSEPH
H. NICHOLSON
P. S. As this subject is immediately connected with your Department, I have deemed it more proper to address this Letter to you
than to the President, before whom however it can be laid if you
consider it necessary -

Dent of the Nautilus and to the commanding Officer of the President.
The information I have rec'd of the Tripoliie Corsairs is that they
were seen off Sardinia, apparently making for the gulph of Genoa they are described as two Ship Xebeques carrying each 6 Guns &
it is supposed about 50 Men. With my sincere wishes for your safety & success I am with real
respect P. S. The foregoing Instructions you will always View as subject
to the changes that may result from the operation of circumstances
which cannot be foreseen or calculated upon, As the senior officer on
the station and having the fullest Confidence in your judgement, I
wish to give you the utmost Latitude in adopting such Dispositions
as you may deem best adapted to accomplish the important objects
confided to us - I n case of your falling in with the several Vessels
that have been ordered to Tripoli - & its vicinity, you will re-oulate
their respective terms of cruizing according to circumstances & in
such a manner that all do not return to Port at the same time, but
that a sufficient Force remain to Blockade the Harbour & to watch
the Coast - I t is my wish that you enjoin upon the different Commanders, not to expose their Vessels unnecessarily to the Enemy's
Battery's as I cannot but deem it imprudent as well as detrimental to
the service to hazard the loss of Masts Spars & g b t a moment when
neither the season nor our preparations permit us to act combinedly
& offensively against the Place, unless some adequate object should
present i t self to justify the risk - From the last advices from
Syracuse I have reason to expect the Cong~essin a few days completely
prepared for a Cruize - I n determining her destination I shall be
governed by such information as I may recieve betwixt this time &
her appearance - Should I not deem it expedient to dispatch her
on some particular service, she will be ordered to join you off Tripoli. The unfortunate Indisposition under which I have so long laboured
and from which my Recovery is slow & gradual incapacitates me
from acting personally with that energy & promptitude which are
nevertheless the favorite objects of my Wishes, I therefore leave it to
you Sir to act in the course of the cruize on whch you are destined as
well with regard to your own operations as those of the other Vessels
of the Squadron, in such a mode as will approve itself to the servlce
to our Country & to ourselves. [LC. JRP, Letters and Orders, 1804-1805.1

seen in the Vicinity of Sardinia there is every reason to suppose that
any Prizes they may take will be sent or convoyed to the Westward

Ships - The discription I have received of the Enemies Vessels seen
in that Quarter is that they are two ship Xebeques carrying each six
Guns and it was supposed about fifty Men - The Term of your
Cruize is for twenty days from the day of your departure, at the

M' Brown & Mr Breckenridge of the Senate have informed me that
you manufacture Gun powder of excellent quality - & they presume that you are disposed to make a contract for supplying a quantity for public use We have our powder put up in Barrels to contain 100 lb9 each & for navy use we require %O to be cannon & $0 to be priming powder
The Barrels are made very strong & Substantial and hooped with
Copper hoops Will you be pleased to inform me on. what terms, and by what
period of time you would engage to f m s h for the use of our navy
a quantity of powder, deliverable either at this place or a t Norfolk
Virginia I will here inform you that the powder which we have generally
used in the Navy has been materially. defective m one respect that I am very desirous of removing t h s defect - and I ask your
aid to enable me to do it - The defect complained of is its imbibing
a moisture in the course of a short cruise, which destroys all its active
& efficient qualities From what cause this defect has roceeded we
are yet rncertain - A Gentleman of Very considerab e science has
stated to me on this Subject that this defect ought not to be ascribed
to the carbonic or sulphureous ingredients used in making the powder,
because the Preparation of these ingrehents 1s extremely plain $
Simple and they do not possess the power of attracting moisture from
the atmosphere in any memorable degree - The evil therefore must
be supposed to exist in the Salt petre - the component parts of
which have not been generally pure or if pure they have not been
compounded in due proportion -

-

NAVY
DEP~
Decr 6, 1806.

In obedience to the resolution of Senate of this day, requiring the
S e c r e w of the Navy "to lay before the Senate, the reasons why an
additional appropriation is required for the naval service of the carrent year" I have the honor to state,
That out of the sum appropriated for the support of the Navy for
the year 1805, the sum of $312,370 has been paid for extra expences,
not contemplated in my Estimate for that year. Statement A. gives
a view of these expences.
The s u m of $287,630, has moreover been paid out of the money
appropriated for the support of the Navy for the year 1805, for expences
incurred during the year 1804, by the Squadron fitted out under the
Act entitled "An Act further to protect the Commerce and Seamen
of the United States against the Barbary Powers" - & by Commodore Preble in his preparatory arrangements for attacking Tripoli.
With respect to these Iast mentioned expences, it may be proper to
observe that there existed at the time they mere incurred an adequate
appropriation made by the Act under which they were authorized,
to pay them, if payment had been necessary during the year 1804,
but it was not necessary to pay them until the year 1805 - and as the
appropriation made by the Act above referred to was not, agreeably
to the Treasury Construction, subject to my order at the time that
payment of these expences was required, they were paid out of the
money appropriated for the support of the Navy for the ear 1805. From the preceding statements it appears that the fo owing sums
ha>ve been paid out of the money appropriated for the support of the
for the year 1805 for expences not contemplated in my Estimate
for t a t year, v i z t

ate in a different direction, on a particular Object, which I consider of
urgent importance to our affairs; independent of the possibillity that
some one or more of the Tripolines may have taken the rout here
contemplated: you are therefore hereby directed to proceed with all
due expedition to Venice, where your first Object will be to procure the
loan from the Goverment of that place of two Bomb Vessels, to be
employed in our opperations against Tripoli during the approaching
Summer.
From the want of Political connections between the Imperial Court
& the U. States and the pacific relations of the former with the Barbary Powers, I cannot flatter myself with much prospect of Success
in this application, but having experienced an unexpected disappointment in another Qdarter, I conceive it my bounden duty to have no
means untried for obtaining that description of Force, so essential to
ensure the prosperity of our future plans, For the same reasons stated
above, I cannot give you any precise instructions as to the mode of
application; you will therefore in this particular be regulated by your
own Judgement and the information you may collect on your arrival. - Should you find it impracticable to procure the loan of Vessels,
your next object must be to purchase for account of the U. States &
on the most moderate terms possible Mortars & Shells, in number and
dimensions, such as you may think best suited to the service for which
they are intended, taking them on board your Frigate or Chartering
a Vessel to transport them hither as circumstances may direct.
You will afford to Captain Robbinson whom it is probable you
will find at Venice whatever assistance he may stand in need of and
recommend him to accellerate as much as possible the repairs of his
Schooner, When these are compleated you will dispatch her direct to
this port, or in case you should receive any information rendering it
expedient - to give her a different destination. you are authorized
to act therein at your discretion.
As you will require funds, as well to defray the conti[n]gent expences
of your Ship, as for other arrangements, I have lodged a Credit on
account of Government with their Agents at Naples Leghorn &
London, as you will perceive by these letters addressg to them respectively, accompanying these instructions, you will consequently draw
on either of those places for the needful sums, accordingly as the Exchange or the opportunities of ne ociating Bills may be most favourable
taliing care however when you %r aw to forward the necessary Letters
of advice. - From the nature of the Service, on which you are destined, you are aware I cannot make any limitation as to time, but as
you must feel equally with myself the value of dispatch to our affairs,
you will use all the expedition which the nature of circumstances may
admit of, I n case you Succeed in obtaining Bomb Vessels, you are
directed to have them compleatly equipg and fitted for service if it
can be done with advantage at Venice and either take them under
the Protection of your own Frigate or send them under convoy of
the Enterprise to this Port. - Should the Vessels not be properly
fitted it wilI be most advisable to send them to Syracme - where
the can be put in a State of action.
$
0 P o C William Riggens the American Consul at Triest you will
apply for any information advice or assistance you may require all
which will doubtless be chearfulIy granted, Having obtaind the
object of your Mission, or if after waiting a sutficient Space of time to

388

give full effect to your application, you find them unattainable, you
will return without delay to this Island.
I have thus explained my Ideas & Intentions with regard to the
service on which you are bound; you will keep those steadily in view,
considering them however, as subject to those changes and deviations
which may result from the opperation of circumstances unforseen &
not to be calculated upon, and in anticipation of which I leave you
the utmost Latitude, to act in such instances as your own Judgment
shall point out.

SIR Permit me to acquaint you with our proceedings respecting
the Brig since the reception of your letter of the 19 th of februaq.
Unfavourable weather prevented us from dismantling her with
that expedition which might have been expected. The Spars,
Rigging, Guns &?are, however carefully deposited in the Nav -yard,
and accounts and receipts taken of them. The Boatswain a n l ~ e v e n
Men, including the Marines, I have retained agreeable to your orders;
but I must confess that I am ignorant how to act with respect to some
circumstances of which I shall take the liberty to make mention.
The Gunner and Carpenter I did not think proper to Discharge, as they
come under the Denomination of Warrant officers I will thank you
for instructions respecting them and the arrested officers, who are
very anxious to learn their fate.

ILLUSTRIOUS
SIR:I have the honor of answering your letter of the
8th Ventose, 13th year, not as Charge dlMaires of the United States
of America to the Commissioner appointed by the general committee
but as an ordinary private citizen to another private citizen not being
invested by the government of the United States, nor permitted by
my Government in public relations, according to our policy to have
any official dealings with the official agents of France, and it is only
because of the lack of a public American agent that I accorded the
protection of my government to individuals of that Nation which
claims such protection according to the agreement with Ottoman Porte
and tbe good understanding which exists between the government of
the United States and my own, but I have had no authority over the
public officials of that nation these latter being only accountable for
their acts to their own government.
Behiid the idea that your excellency has connived that the fugitives sought b you may have taken refuge among the service personnel of the
erican commandant. I have communicated to him
the contents of your letter, and from the well l i n o ~ nsentiments of
this same commandant, I am persuaded that a regular report directed
to him will receive all the consideration that it merits.
If the fugitives mentioned above were found under my jurisdiction
they would instantly be handed over to justice, my sentiments being
perfectly in accord with those of your excellency in general principles
as set forth in your letter.
I have the honor to salute your excellency with all distinction.

It is my wish to send to the Mediterranean as many Men in the
John Adums as she can conveniently carry thither. I want to send
out 500 Men, of which number at least 200 must be Able Seamen.
You will begin to recruit as soon as you conveniently can. Enter
the Men to serve 2 years (although it is probable they will not be
kept in the Mediterranean for 2 years). Allow Able Seamen $12 per
month - ordinary Seamen $8, Boys $6. Engage healthy, active
men who can fight. Allow 2 or 4 months' advance on the Customary
security. Let me know by return of Mail, or as soon as you can,
how many Men you will probably be able to engage in New York and
how many the John Adams will conveniently carry out.
I have ordered Lieu! Lee, of Boston, to report himself to you, and
to open Rendezvous at Boston to enter 100 Men, 50 of which to be
Able Seamen, the residue ordinary Seamen and Boys. He will report
to you the progress he may be making, and you will report to me
his progress and your own. When Lieut Lee shall have entered 100
Men I shall order him to repair with them to Newyork & join the
J. Adums. The Navy Agent upon whom you will make your requisitions will
render you all needful assistance.

be prepared with all racticable dispatch to join you. I shall send

that the whole Fleet will join you in all the month of June next.
From the tempestuous weather which generally prevails in the Mediterranean in the earlier months of the year, we presume that you
will not make any very serious attack on Tripoli till about the h t
of July. I hope therefore that these Gun Boats may join you in good
season.

which the ships of the Squadron when in this Port stand in Need
of this is proportionably less than two p' Cent in a Commercial Po*,
as here an Agent must abandon every other Idea of Business to the

PHI*iWarch 9 tP 1805
D': SIR After closing m last respects I am compelled to draw your
attention to a disagreeab e subject but I count upon the goodness
of your heart to listen with a patient attention to observations arrising from the enclosed copy of a Letter just recQfrom my old antagonist
Eaton & if proper beg as a favor that you will lay it a t some leisure
moment before M' Madison & the other Gentlemen of the Administration conscious of the unmerited system to destroy my reputation
in the view [?I of my Country, if I have been the guilty wretch that
he threatens to proclaim me, why have I not been called to account?
If this Letter is intended to awe me into a temper to mediate with
Government in his behalf, he is mistaken, I am not of a temper to
be intimidated by his threats & defy his utmost rancor, 'tho I confess
I feel a remorse a t being handed down to posterity (however infamous
the Author) whose motives will be unknown to the World, as this
Man is now in the service of Government The Sec? of the Navy well knows that I never had any instructions
from him but in a subordinate stile to authorize this wanton abuse of
my conduct while in the Mediterranean Seas, can an UfGcers merits
be estimated in a proper scale who never had it in his power to act
with energy? hard indeed is my fate never to have beenentrusted witha
Command and to bear all the malovelence of party rage in vain
have I urged for an explanation on this head; have I not cause to
conjecture that this Man bath been the cause of t,he many mortifications, I have experienced, & by his ingenuity prejudiced the Government against me? but we shall see the effects of imploying him again
after what has pasd I well know that he has actled ungenerously by
me in prejudicing many of the Officers ready to beleive his foul insinu-

ations & willing to put me out of the way with the same facility that
~MorP.iswas, which woud no doubt be a gratifying object with him &

the most virtuous of Administrations may be deceived by malevolent
Men - this Letter is not only levelled at me but at the few friends
who have patronized me & am bold to say that I am not unworthy
of such Patronage
It now rest with the Administration to say whether I have merited
this treatment & to be handed down to Posterity by the venemous
Pen of this Miscreant, not but that I am capable of shielding myself
from all personal attacks but where an Officer is unworthyly traduced
in the line of his duty Government ought to defend him in his reputation; you may remember the original cause of this persecution,
which was owing to my discharging bis Ship from Got-ernment serrice, which Cap$ Rarron ought to have done before my arrival, but
Eaton was his friend I can send the whole detail of this business if
necessary so anxious am I to support a fair & Honorable Kame & if
I do not ask too much of you & theres no impropriety in it I coud wish
at least to start fair with our now Sec? of the Navy on this subject as
well as others that no undue prejudices may arrise, but I presume he
will revert to the correspondence of all the Officers to, & from, to
investigate the merits & sen-ices of each such Letters being filed in the
Office I hare just red a Letter from Dan! Murray dated Malta 23'd Octr

have less than three Vessels near that port, say one Easterly a second
Westerly & a third in front of the Town - but unfortunately the

stablish that arran ement You observe that the Constellation has not Water and Provisions
for a t least one Month I had better proceed for Malta as soon as
possible taking Cape Bon in my way, Permit me to remark for your
consideration that she has Provisions and Water for Two Months,
which might Enable her to continue the Blockade for at least that
time, a service I would cheerfully prefer were it not for the consideration of our Crew, Thirty three of which are Innoculated for the small
Pox and as the season is advancing that their services and every Exertion on our part will be required I presume it advisable to have them
recruited with all possible dispatch - With these considerations
aided by conviction that your presence is required at Malta, I make
no hesitation in saying that the service demands your Immediate
return to that port. -

SIR, MI Eaton, in making a representation against me, upon which
Capt Hull has thought proper to place me in arrest, has most injustly
injured my reputation, without iving me either the explanations, or
satisfaction to which I conceive myself entitled. Permit me therefore to enclose you a statement of circumstances,
in evidence of the grounds upon which his assertions have been built Whilst at Cairo in Egypt, being in the habit of resorting occasionally
with several other American Officers to a Billiard Table in the neighbourhood of the E n lish Cmsul, a misunderstanding arose one afternoon between Mr fiarquhar L myself, concerning the points at a
Game of billiards, the consequence of which was a fight at fistycuffs I nm, Sir, far from advocating a habit which I have ever held in great
contempt, & which at that time inspired sentiments of much uneasiness, nor should I have descended to this mode of redress for the insult
I received, had it not been of the grossest nature On this occasion, Mr Eaton thought proper to take exception at my
conduct, and in a letter addressed to me the day following, recommended my return to Alexandria - I complied with his request,
and in company with Mr F'arquhar two days afterwards embarked from
Cairo, but in consequence of some expressions which came from Mr
Eaton in assertion of his right to order my return, did not take leave
of him.
From this period, Sir, The arrows of hi revenge poisoned by malice
have been directed towards me.

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1804 TO 1806

Some weeks after my return to Alexandria, I was accidentally
informed, that M' Eaton had given publicity at Cairo at the Consular
Table, to the malevolent assertion which he has brought against me,
Viz that of improper conduct at a Card Table.
I confess myself unable to express what were [my] feelings on the
receipt of this information, of which I had never before been apprized,
and of which untill that moment I had heard nothing of, and imrnediately resolved to seek an explanation on the return of Mr Eaton who
was then absent about 40 miles from Alexandria. On the return of Mc Eaton, in order to a full investigation of the
subject, I wrote to him the following Note.

Mr Goldsborough begs the favor of Mr Eat.on's company in t h e ward room U . S . H n ~ cArgus
Pebruaru 6 t h 1806.

With this request he complied, but on being asked by me whether
he had made the assertion contained in his report, and what were
the Grounds upon [which] his assertion had been formed, simply
answered that it was not a proper time to ive explanations, & left
the ward room, much disconcerted, and t,he ay following, after many
abusive expressions uttered at the Consular house at Alexandria,
which were afterwards told me, requested Capt Hull to have me
arrested
Finding myself destitute of explanation, I determined to wait a day
or two longer without resorting to further measures, impressed with
a belief that he would certainly come forward, but perceiving on his
part no other disposition than that of evasion, addressed to him a
second Letter - Vz.

f

"SIR, Yo11 have accused me in a foreign country of a dishonest Act -you
have given geueral publicity t o this assertion, amongst t h e first characters
of this place, without producing a single evidence of the fact I now call on you a second time, in the name of t h e Flag under which
I serve, in t h e nams of every American Officer, and as a d u t y due t o a n

I had not the most distant Idea he would longer evade the subject,
but in place of giving it any consideration, the letter addressed to
him was barely read, and returned by the Servant.
Finding every step I had taken ineffectual, I then resolved on a
personal Interview; the consequences of which were a candid avowal
of the contempt I felt for him, of the sentiments which actuated me
to that confession, and of my fixed resolution towards him should we
ever meet. I t is impossible, Sir, to give you a minute account of every circumstance which formed the basis of his malevolence towards me; They
are not within my immediate recollection I feel it a misfortune, that the imperious situation of circumstances
should at this moment preclude the possibility of an immediate investigation of the subject, and hope Sir, that conduct so replete with
malice & revenge will not be countenanced.

The camel drivers and footmen who followed the horses revolted

irresolute and dispondent.- Money, - more money was the only
stimulous which could give motion to the camp. - The forenoon

SIR! We presume that Capt Hull of the U. S.Brig Argus, who

Sailed from hence on the 1gt"ltQ must long since have arrived a t
the Rendezvous - and M' Eaton's Dispatches will consequently have
made you acquainted with our Disbursements to him for Account of
the United States, to the extent of Six Thousand Span?'Dollars; which
M? Eaton engaged should be refunded with all possible expedition. The Service he is employed on, has since unexpectedly required further supplies, and to promote its object, we have advanced him on
Account of the U. S. Seven Thousand Span?' Doll? more; making the
whole of our actual disbursement $13,000, for which we hold his Receipts. - In a Country of small resources like this where Banking
operations are totally unlmown & Specie is consequently the more
valuable, you will easily conceive that it was not without considerable
inconvenience, that at so short a notice we could collect, and dispose
of this Sum Mr Eaton stated to us, that to provide against all contingencies, he had recommended in his Dispatches by the Argus, that
as much as $20,000 should be sent up in the vessel which was to replace the f i s t $6000 we advanced - & he has assigned our reimbursement of the surplus on that fund - Tho' we do not apprehend any
disappointment yet for the greater certainty, we deem it prudent to
apprize

SIR In consequence of the authority Vested in me b Commodore
Barron (as relates to the disposition of the different U. Vessels now
on this Coast) I have to desire that you remain here in continuance
of the Blockade until you are relieved by an adequate force to effect
the same, without some precarious circumstance should oblige you to
return sooner - An effectual Blockade cannot be maintained by less
than two Vessels - When the President joins you I think it advisable that you send either her or the Vixen into Port (Malta) taking
Cape Bon in her return, in order that a relief may be formed for the
convenience of your own Ship, & which ever of these two Vessels you
may think proper to detain, as also the general benefit of the service For your Information & Goverment, I do myself the pleasure to
enclose you a Copy of the heads of Commodore Barrons instructions
to the different Vessels now at Sea, as also Transcribe herein a paragraph of his orders to me. - "It is my wish that you enjoin uppon
the different commanders not to expose their Vessels unnecessaril
to the Enemys Battery's, as I cannot but deem i t imprudent as we
as detrimental to the service to hazard the loss of Masts, Spars
at a moment when neither the season nor our preparations permit
us to act combinedl & offensively against the Place, unless some
adequate object sho d present its self to justify the risk". -

SIR, Yours of the 9 t a t came duly to hand. I n reply thereto
we have to say, that we can procure the Powder warranted to be of
the best quality from the manufactory of M' Dupont, near to Wilmington a t forty dollars per barrel of one hundred pounds - the
whole quantity deliverable a t this place or Wilmington in tuTomonths
from this time: - But if the money should be paid on the deliverg
of the Powder, a deduction of one dollar per barrel will be made by
the manufacturer.
Mr Dupont informs us that he does not manufacture cannon
powder in large quantities unless the same should be ordered, therefore he has none on hand at present; and that it will require a period
of about sixty days to make that quantity in.
If this price and those terms should answer your purpose, we shall
be infinitely obliged by having your authority to contract for the
powder, and to have your further orders with respect to its delivery
This day our John Bird was a t the Manufactory, which is on the
Brandywine, about five Miles N. N. West of Wilmington.

16'b March 1805
DEARSIR I am acquainted that Sidi Mahammed Dhgies Minister of Foreign affairs to His Excellencey the Bashaw of Tripoli
has written to you on a certain subject.
The Minister has been much indisposed for several months past with
an idamation in his eyes, and Doctr Ridgeley his Surgeon has done
every thing in his power, for him, without its having the desired
effect; for the many obligations that myself and OEcers are under
to the Minister, I wish that it may be agreable for you to render him
some aid, through one of the Surgeon's of your Squadron
Permit me to observe that whatever Sidi Mahammed Dhgies, or my
worthy freind, Nicholas, C, Nissen Esqr His Danish Majesty's Consul in this place, writes to you on the subject will in my opinion merit
your attention, for, from my knowledge of the freindly disposition
of the Minister, I have reason to beleive that his assertions are

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS

founded on candour - It is unnessecary for me to say more as
you no doubt will fully comprehend me

[Thefollowing was written in invisible ink.]
16 March 1805
D' SIR This day Sidi Mahammed Dhgies sent for me and informed
me in a confidence, that he had wrote to you recommending a person
to come to negotiate and requested me to write a letter [ms illegible]
in the obscure manner that I have done, that in case of discovery
it would be [unlintelligble or foreign to the subject
I really beleive that the Minister is sincerely desirous for peace
for exclusive of his freindly disposition it is greatly his interest to
have it, and was a person to come and remain a few days to negotiate I have not a doubt but what peace could be made on the terms
that Com Preble offered at all events i t would in my opinion have
the happy effect of making the Bashaw%ubjects clamorous, as they
would then see that America had the disposition to make peace, and
that the continuance of the war was owlng to the Bashaw,
The Houses here of stone and mud and badly furnished, of course
the damage in Bombarding cannot be as great as if i t was otherwise.
Permit me my dear Barron to make one observation - To reduce
the Bashaw to moderate terms I suppose is the object of our Govt
and your expectation to release us from captivity without paying
is in my opinion impossible without land forces and I hope that our
Country will not think that it is the subject of peace they pay for,
but the liberty of their unfortunate Citizens fell captives in its service,
and it may be assured that what ever is paid, no (Tripolitan from
what they they have experienced of the Americans) will consider one
farthing of it paid for purchasing [MS mutilated] of Tripoli.
I n my letter of the 13 I gave you some information about Mr
Beaussier
I candidly beleive that any person might come here with the
greatest safety and I beleive that an American d l answer much
better than any Frenchman or any other countrymen
The Minister has great influence with the Bashaw and is doing
all in his power to bring- him to a disposition of making peace on
moderate ierms.
I know you will do me the justice to believe that my representations are actated for the good of our Cause
Yours truly

Walking by the house called the American house, I perceived that
it was full of Turks, and a strong guard was at the door. On inquiry,
I found that they were the sons and nearest relations of the Bashaw's
officers,who had gone in the expedition to the frontiers. The Bashaw
kept these people as hostages for the fidelity of his officers, whom it
appears, he was afraid to trust, least they might join in the rebellion
and come against Tripoli. I t was said that his highness had received
a letter, stating that the Americans were making great preparations
to attack Tripoli. A tent was pitched on the battery of the castle,
and orders given to keep watch all night, and every night afterwards.
Orders were also given to make every preparation to repel the
Americans.

Tripoli

TRIPOLIMarch 18 1805
SIR The Bashaw's Minister Sidi Mahomet Dghies personally
desirous of a reestablishment of peace with the U. S. of America and

422

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1804 TO 1805

wishing to contribute whatever may be in his power to the conclusion
of it has requested me Sir, in his name to address you this Letter. Sidi Mahomet Dghies is convinced that you are informed of his
endeavors in 1801 to prevent the declaration of War; He alone opposed
the general opinion of the Divan in this respect - The Letters of
Mr Cathcart late Consul for the U. S. at Tripoli, to his Government
a t that time will bear testimony of this fact. The War having nevertheless been declared, nothing has since been
omitted by Sidi Mahomet Dghies that could contribute to the conclusion of a Peace. Sidi M. Dghies has personally too much Interest in the undisturbed
tranquility and Security of the trade of Tripoli not to avail himself
of every mean that could be conducive to what has been his Interest
& constant desire. - In this moment he wishes to prevent further
hostilities; the state of his Health, his family & his private concerns
are so many reasons for him to endeavor to persuade both parties to
come to an agreement; he is certain that these are likewise your
wishes Sir & the intention of your Government - The situation
besides of your unfortunate Countrymen here which Sidi M. Dghies
has endeavored to alleviate as much as it has been in his power, is
nevertheless such that they & their relations in America cannot but
look upon it as an act of Humanity to accelerate the conclusion of a
peace that again can restore them to their Country. - Sidi M Dghies
is desirous of a peace, and he wishes that a Negotiation should be renew'd before the commencement of any direct hostilities against this
place. His health & particular1 the state of his Eyes will oblige him
to retire with his family in a s ort time to the Country, & will not
permit him again to return to Town at any future overture or Negotiation of Peace, & he is afraid that being absent he shall not be able
so easily to suscitate in the mind of the Bashaw equal peaceful sentiments with his own - A Negotiation entirely by Letters is tedious
and difficult; to negotiate by a person sent on shore from a Ship of
War & who returns again on board after a short Stay & nayb be after
a momentary Interview with the Bashaw has many difficulties &
proves often more detrimental to a Negotiation than productive of a
Peace - Sidi M Dghies don't think it necessary to enlarge upon the
difficulties that attend this way of negotiating&their cause; Youcannot sir but be aware of them yourself; He proposes therefore as the
most effectual manner of conducting a Negotiation of Peace to send
to Tripoli a person properly authorized & furnished with Instructions Whoever shall be sent can be assured of the most perfect Inviolabilit,y - Shou'd his & Sidi M. Dghies' earnest endeavors to reestablish Peace prove successful, the business is thereby naturally brought
to a happy conclusion; should it however unfortunately prove otherwise, the Negotiator will have liberty to return free from molestation
of any kind & in what manner he may judge convenient.
You will please Sir yourself to fix upon the securities you may
require for the faithful observation of these conditions, in case you
shall think proper to agree to these proposals, & whenever you in
answer to this Letter may request the admission of a Negotiator After having in this manner candidly & coddenteally stated to you
Sir his mind, Sidi M. Dghies hopes to have precluded eve suspicion
of his peaceful intentions & convinced you that every fac%ty will be
shewn for a mutual satisfactory conclusion of peace; he don't believe

H

423

it necessary tto observe that a sincere $ lasting peace is at any time
preferable even to a successful. War, that War has many chances &
that often unforeseen accidents occasion losses, however prudent the
measures were taken to assure Success.
That Sidi Mahomet Dghies has requested me to write you Sir in
his name this Letter, & that the Contents have been faithfully translated I have no doubt but that you will readily give Credit, but give
me likeuise leave to assure you Sir that I, in case I did not myself
believe the sentiments contain'd in this Letter sincere, would have
excused myself from putting them to paper, & in this persuasion I
shall consider i t as a very favorable circumstance for me, if I have
been found any way instrumental to the means of bringing about a
Peace between the U. S. of America & the Bashnw of Tripoli & of
procuring the liberty of your unfortunate Countrynlen here, having the
Honor to be with the greatest Respect Sir:

Marched fifteen miles to a castle called by the -4rabs Massouah: an extensive plain valley, surrounded in the rear and flanks by a
stoney desert, and in front by white sand drifts of great height which
cuts the view from the sea. - In this valley are found vest,ages
of ancient fabrications, gardens, mansions and pleasure houses, evidence of former cultivation and improvement, of which the place is
very susceptible; though now all lies buried in ruins, except some miserable patches of badly culti~atedwheat and barley. - Here was a
chiek, wllo held the castle, and a few Arab families in tents. - The
modern castle is a square of about one hundred and fifty feet, built
of rough stone about eleven feet high, - without bastions or battlements, but with loop holes. - I t is the de osit of the produce and
trafic of the place. Cattle, sheep, goats, fow s, butter in skins, dates
and milk, were found and offered for sale, but very dear. I now learned, for the first bime, that our caravan was freighted by
the Bashaw only to this place, and that the owners had received no
part of their pay. - KO persuasion could prevail on them to proceed to Bomba nor to wait our arrival thither for their pay. They
alledged that they had fulfilled their engagement with the Bashaw,
and would now return to their families in Behara, for whose safety
they had serious apprehendsions from the Kerchief of Demanhour.
The Chiek il Taiib favored their pretentions. - I promised to procure the cash for their payment on condition that they would proceed
two days further, where we expected to find Arab tribes and hire
another caravan. This they engaged to do. - I reduced mv stock
of cash to 3 Venitien sequins, and, with a hundred and forty dollars
borrowed of the christian officers and men, passed into the hands of the
Bashaw, six hundred and seventy three dollars 50/;o~;which sum, together

SIR I[n] consequence of the discretionary orders you hare invested
me with, it is with due deference t,o your better judgement I take the
liberty to offer my opinion as to the measures most salutary to pursue,
in our present situation with Tripoli. The Blockade I conceive i t most advisable to preserve as minutely
as the season of the year will admit, not o d y to prevent the Enemys
Cruizers getting out of Port, which consequently must endanger our
Commerce, and add incalculable perplexity, by deranging every thing
like a systematic disposition being made, of the services of the different Vessels of the Squadron; but to prevent their recieving such supplies as can in any way augment their force to the prejudice of our
intended opperations. To maintain a Blockade effectually two if not
three Vessels, ought aIways to be stationed before the Port to prevent,
as far as circumstances of bad weather will admit, the possibility of
Vessels of every description getting either out or in. I t is true that some of their Cruizers having already got out renders
this disposition in some measure incomplete; but they nevertheless
I conceive ought to pursued, as the only definitive 8i determinate
means to prevent greater injury's. - Provided six Vessels were
formed into a relief solely to preserve the Blockade, the service would
be easy & the Vessels sure to be in order $ ready for service as soon
as the Weather wit1 authorise a combined attack - There are beside
these [space] Vessels employ'd in the Bloclcade, three others, exclusive
of the Enterprize & Syren, two of which it may perhaps be advisable
to employ on stations most likely to intercept the Enemy's Cruizers
(now a t Sea) entering other Ports, say Bengazi, Derne & Tunis; and
the third particularly charged with the procuration of such auxiliary
Force, as you may consider necessary to ensure success to your future
opperations. I should not have ventured to have given an opinion unaslc'd for
thus freely, was it not, with an intention of alle~iatingthe anxiety
which you must naturally feel in consequence of your being debared
from using those exertions which your capacity would enforce, was
you in Health, and I trust you will duly appreciate my Intentions,
even should you not consider them worth further consideration. With sincere Wishes of a speedy restoration of your Health

St PETERSBURG
8/20 M a ~ c h1805
SIR,The letter you did me the honor to address me from Syracuse
the 16 Jan? & it's inclosures came to hand the l e s inst? I lament the
occurence of the Circumstances which form it's principal sub'ect, &
sincerely regret with you that our Warfare with Tripoli shou d give
rise to events tending to commit our good understanding with any
Nation, & more especially one, with which our friendship appears
thus far to have so happily prospered. My first intelligence of the Capture of the Russian Vessel S! Michael
is communicated by your letter, & I conceived it both correct &
politic on a subject of this apparent importance to anticipate the
Prince de Czartoryski & by a just explanation of the facts to prepare
his mind against any improper prejudice which misrepresentation might
occasion. - I therefore on receipt of your dispatches requested an
interview of the Minister, on the succeeding day an opportunity was
afforded me of giving him a full detail of the transaction, in the progress of which, the principle of Blockade was discussed, & the right
of one Nation to interrupt the pursuits of another between which peace
& good understanding prevailed though those pursuits were directed
to an enemy's port. - The Minister conceived this right of late to
have been exclusively exercised by G. Britain, whose ascendency of
maritime strength gave her the means of annoying her ememies by
Blockade, & other modes of Warfare unusual in former periods, &
whidh he believed were disavowed by most Nations of the present
day, who were very generally attached to a measure opposite in principle, & to which America was also a partizan, that of a Support of
the independency of the neutral flag, except in Cases where i t aimed
to give protection to Articles, usually constituted contraband of war,
bound to an ennemy's port. - Finding the Minister has blended two
questions, wholly seperate of each other I was bold to inform his
Excellency, that his remarks on this Subject, which as far as they
applied, we Should ever be proud to recognize were irrelevant to the
principle of blockade, which was in et-ery respect distinct, a lengthy
discussion insued, in which I maintained that Blockade was not a
new operation of war, i t was almost as old as war itself, & it's light
& principle had been defined & acknowledged by Nations since the
remotest periods of History. - One Nation therefore, employing a

i

WARS T ~ ~ I TBARBARY

POWERS

429

force, at great expence against another could not allow a friendly
Power to convey Supplies to those ports declared blockaded i t would
render such blockade perfectly nugatory & an attempt to violate tho
Same, every acknowledged law of Nations on the Subject had declared
punishable by the confiscation of the property of the agressor.
The Powers who formed the armed neutrality the war before the
last, who aimed a t the establishment of the Principle espoused by the
Prince, understood blockade in this sense &- Russia who was the principle party in that confederacy described a piace to be in a State of
Blockade When i t was dangerous to approach it. The Minister a t length felt disposed to concede in part the principle,
which enabled me to proceed in an examination of the local circumstances attending this Capture, in which. in admitting it's legallity
on the above hypothesis, I proceeded to a deffence of the officers from
the imputation attached to their conduct by Monsr de Becker whose
letter & the authority on which it was written &- made a Subject of
particular comment, which the Minister entirely disavowed, & added,
that Mr deBecker has permitted himself to be improperly transported,
whose duty should have pointed to an opposite proceedure. - I
replied that I lamented extremely the necessity I felt myself under to
entertain his Excell? on this Subject, but the declarations of the
Consul were so incomparable with the disposition & Character of our
officers, which had ever been distinguished by honor & circumspection,
& were in such direct opposition to those Sentiments, which the Prince
w-as so well assured animatcd our Government, under whose orders &
authority they acted that I felt myself in duty impelled to a notice
of his Correspondence. - The Minister lamented the circumstances,
repeated his disapprobation of the manner the Agent has treated it, &expressed a hope that we should not again have occasion to meet on
such unpleasant business. I have thought i t necessary to offer you
the foregoing particulars of this Conversation on the Subject of Blockade (a matter in which You are well assured, my pro~inceno wise
embraces) merely as it may be considered to have relation to the Sequal
of this Conference, which alone came within my Sphere of action.
The remarks which the detention of the two Ottoman Ships have led
You to make, in reply to my Suggestion on the Subject of the proposed
intercourse with the Port with America, are in perfect unison with the
impression which dictated that Communication to Commodore Prebble;
those principles Sir, which should govern our Conduct toward all
Nations, which YOUhave so pertinently expressed, I trust will ever be
judiciously practiced by our Naval Commanders.
I informed the Prince de Czartoryski what you mention the Chevalier d'ltalisky to have written. - The Prince replied that the
Chevalier required no answer from his Court, he has received general &
explicit instructions in the name of his Sovereign, to make a reclamation for the Prisoners, & was directed to follow i t up, but unhappily
the orders of the Port were but too little regarded by those States
declared to be it's trebutaries. I confess I was myself sanguine upon
the happy tendency, I thought might attach to the mediation of thls
Powerful Court, & which joined to the interference of France. which

To Sir Alexander John Ball, Governor of Malta, from Captain Samuel Barron,
U. S. Navy

MALTA
20th[or 211 March 1805.
SIR I have been duly honored with your Excellency's letter of yesterday, and the enclosures accompaning it.
On the Subject of the Ottoman Vessel, [,Mastico?] Commanded by
Kinth Mustaffa, Captured by the American Squadron, under the
Command of my predecessors, Commodore Preble, I have never
received any cornnlunications from the Ott,oman Porte; or I should
have given the information which I now beg leave to make to your
Excellency
It appears from the Communications from Commodore Preble, that
this Vessel was in the harbour of Tripoli when one of our Frigates, the
Philadelphia, unfortunately ran on a shoal near that place. - That
the Commander of said Vessel hoisted upon her the Tripoline Flag,
and in conjunction with the Tripoline Gun boats, went off and after
she had surrendered, took out the Captain, Officers & Crew and
delivered them to the Bashaw of Tripoli where they now remain in
Captivity and plundered Captain Bainbridge of his watch, and the
first lieut of his sword &$and several other things which \$-ereon board
his Vessel xhen taken, and of which he boasted to have taken from
them, when he boarded the Frigate. - This Act of hostility was
sufficient to induce Commodore Preble to Consider her as a proper
Subject of Capture; and he accordingly detained her when she came
out of Tripoli, with the persons on board. - The Chouss which had
been sent to Tripoli by the late Captain Pacha, and all others, excepting the Captain, who were found to be Turks, were liberated; but
those who wereTripoline Subjects were detained as prisoners of Xar. The Slaves have also been detained. But as I know it is the u-ish of
my Government to mantain harmony and a good understanding with
the Grand Senior, when [w-horn] we beleive would never justify such
an outrageous Act of hostilit as was committed upon us by the
Captain Kintll Mustaffa, I sha 1 not hesitate to deliver up said Slaves,
whenever I can be informed to JThom they are to be given, and also
to release any Others if such there be, who were not Tripoline Subjects,
on board said Vessel.
The Circumstances under which said Vessel was Captured, made
i t necessary that the case should be laid before the Government of the
U. States of America and a legd adjudication be had on the Subject.
As we have no Tribunal in this sea which can take cognizance of causes
of this Bind, it becomes expedient for the Captain to go to the United
States to appear on the Trial. - I expect very shortly, to learn the
decision on this Subject, and if it should appear that the Vessel is

r'

WARS W I T H BARBARY POTVERS

431

not a fair Prize, a full i n d e d c a t i o n will be made to those concerned.
But if it be proved that the conduct of the Captain was such as to
cause her to be condemned, 1 trust that His Hig[h]ness the Grand
Senior will have too much justice to consider it as an act of hostility
against him; but as a measure necessary and Justifiable by the laws
of War. CoIineI Lear communicated to me your Excellency's letter and the
extract of a Letter from his Excellency Alexander Straton Esq! to
yourself, on the Subject of the tn7o Vessels under Ottoman Colours,
which where Captured by the Squadroil under my Command, attemptr
to enter the port of Tripoli.
As these Vessels were taken within a very short distance of the
Port of Tripoli, standing directly for the harbour, under a full sail,
and with a wind which would have been highly favourable for them to
have taken another direction, had they been bound else where; and
from the Courses which they had steered from the place of their
departure as well as from many other circumstances, no doubt remained on the mind of the Captors of their being bound for for Tripoli,
which we were tehen blockading. - I therefore thought it proper
to detain them; and the Cargoes being of a perishable nature, and in
a state to render a delay in unloading them dangerous, they have been
sold, and the proceeds securely deposited to be delivered to WhomsoI have long since stated to my Governs
ever they may belong.
t,he circumstances under which these Vessels were taken, and am in
daily expectation of instructions either to send them t,o the U. States
for adjudication, or to deliver them up. In the latter case, the Vessels
will be ddivered in good order, and the proceeds of the Cargoes & s
accounted for to the satisfaction of the.proprietors, the the Agents of
whom 3: have seen since have been in thts place and who appear to be
satisfied with the situation in which this business stands.
I regret exceedingly that your Excellency has had so much trouble
in this affair; but as the Communications have been made to me
through you, I must beg the favor of your conveying the explaination
which I have here given in the way you may find most Convenient;
and I beg your Excellency will accept my best thanks for your kind
6.friendly attentions as well as on other occasions, which I shall not
fail to make known to my Government.

myself the honor to address you several letters, under cover, & to t,he

of your health, with a paragraph on the political movements at home.
The State of Europe, must unquestionably be better known, at the
Seat of Govt, than in this isolated abode of distress and misery Russia has not yet declared her absolute intention with respect to
Europe - the first object of her armament speaks for itself; it seems
to be no less t'han the perfect, annihilation of the Ottoman Empire;

432

NAVAL OPEEATIONS FROM 1804 TO 1805

how such a Gigantic plan can best be executed, is left with the Statesman to decide - it is conjectured (and I think with much Justice)
that a secret understanding, on this point, exists, between the emperors, of France & Russia - Alexander, has refused to recognize
Buoniparte; has armed powerfull by Sea & land; has forced the
Sublime Porte, to follow his examp e, in all that relates to France; and
still perfect harmony seems to exist between the two Cabinets - the
prompt & decisive measures of the French Govr since the establiihment of the first Consul, with every European Power, by whom her
usurped dignity,has been asailed, renders her present silence a greater
Mystery; how & when these are to be revealed, I dare not hazard
an opinion Recent advises from Syracuse, speak confidently that the King of
Xaples, has ordered his Capt General & Governors, to give quiet
possession of the Island, to the Russians, who are daily expected, in
force - this is an old Story new dressed and -4th me has very little
credit.
Spain is making immense preparations for a vigorous prosecution
of the War - Portugal cannot escape - and La Petite France, is
approaching her death bed - Italy, Holland, & Switzerland, are
not yet organized; but the Crown, is preparing, which will forever
annex them to the french dominions and as Nations wipe them from
the face of the Earth Of Tripolitan affairs, I can say very little - Comodore Barron
has been ill these four or five months, and is still a very feeble convalescent - his complaint is said to be an affection of the Liver The Constitution has been t o Lisbon for men - the Argus, to Alexandria for "the man" and the Enterprize to Trieste for repairs; The
object of all their visits has I beleive been accomnplished; without
affecting the Blockade which is strictly kept up The Bashaw has made considerable preparations for a ~igorous
defence; but he is much streightened - he has to contend against
civil comotions, Famine, and an enterprising enemy - the rumour
is spread of the arrival of his Brother Achmet Bashaw; and Jussuph
has actualIy sent a Camp against Derna - thus far every thing
favours, our approaching Campaign; I pray God that the Comodores
health may be sufficiently established to endure its fatigue Tunis is again on growling order; and His Excellency, daily gives
me more reason to beleive that our peace cannot be very lasting;
If I had the power I would bring him to a decision before I close
this letter; it would be to the honor and dignity of my Country;
and free me from the painful suspense under which I have laboured
for eighteen months -

Last night the rest of the camels left us to return to Egypt. I now discovered a complot between the chiek il Taiib and sundry
other chiefs, at which I thought the Bashaw connived, purporting a
resolution to proceed no further until they should have assurance
A report had been started,
of the arrival of our vessels at Bomba.said to be brought by a pilgrim on his way from Morocco toMecca,

WARS WITH BARBARY POWEI2S

that a force consisting of eight hundred cavalry and numerous foot
mere on their march from Tripoli for the defense of Derne, &- were
actually passed Bengazi. - I thought this an argument that urged
acceleration rather than delay - A great deal of noise and some
counsel was heard among the Bey's chiefs, in which I was not consulted, and a final resolution taken that they would remain on the
spot till a runner could go Bomba and return. In consequence of
which I ordered their rations stopped, and resolved myself to take
possession of the castle and fortify myself there until I could get
intelligence to our naval detachment to come to our relief, when I
would take off our Christians and leare them to take measures for
their oum subsistence and safety. - I t was now twelve oclock a t
night. - I left the Arab Chiefs in the Bashaw's tent confused and
embarrassed, - and retired to my own markee and reflections.
We have marched a distance of two hundred miles, though an
inhospitable waste of world without seeing the habitation of an animated being, or the tracks of man, except where superstition has
marked her lonely st,eps o'er burning sands and rocky mountains,
whence the revelation of one of her most hypocritical fanatics trains
her wretched victims a tedious pilgrimage to pay their devotion at
his shrine. - But while we reproach the imposter we cannot but
ascribe some good to the effect of the imposition: it has here and
there opened a water source to its votaries, which now allays the
thirst of pilgrims, bound across this gloomy desert on pursuits vastly
different from those which lead to Mecca; the liberation of three
hundred Americans from the Chains of Barbarism, & a manly peace.

that if a Person was to come here to negotiate before an attack was
made that Peace could be effectedfor one hundred & twenty thousand
dollars 20/M and if the attack should not prove us[*] successfull it is
very probable that such a sum would not release us from captivity,

SIR,By Captain Hull, who arrived in this harbor with the U S

addressed to me, together with communications for the Secretary
of the Navy and copies of the correspondence betwixt yourself and
Cap? Hull relative to your proceedings from you arrival in Egypt
until his departure from thence; also by the hands of Mahumed
secretary a letter frclm H. Ex. Hamet Bashaw announcing his junction with you, all which I have perused with an at,tention and delib-

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS

439

eration which the important and interesting nature of their contents
demands - I cannot but applaud the energy and perseverance that
has characterized your progress through a series of perplexing and
discouraging diffuculties to the attainment of the object of your
research - an attainment which I am disposed to consider as a fair
presage of future success - On receipt of these communications I
did not loose a moment in making the necessary arrangements for
sending you succours, and I now dispatch the brig Argus with the
sloop under her convoy carrying a variety of stores and provisions
according to the accompanying list - Captain Hull will shape his
course direct for Bomba where he calculates on finding you with
the Bashaw and his army, and where he supposes you will make a
stand - I have directed him to deliver these stores to you, to be
applied as your discretion may direct - He has also under his
charge a sum in specie amounting to seven thousand dollars which
is likewise to be placed a t your disposal - By the time these vessels
establish a communication with you, you will have been enabled to
form a correct opinion as to the prospect of ultimate success and
thence to estimate the advantages likely to result from this cooperation, & by this opinion you must be governed in the application of
the succours - Should you have encountered unexpected difficulties which place the chances of success upon more than precarious
grounds, your own prudence will suggest the propriety of not committing these supplies and the money uncontroledly to the power
of the Bashaw - Indeed in the point of view in which I regard
the measures already pursued as well as the subject of co-operation
generally, I concieve you ought to tread with the utmost circumspection It is far from my wish to damp your ardor or that of your
companions in arms by laying too great a stress upon the cold maxims
of prudence whereby the tide of success is often lost, something I am
aware, should always be left to fortune in undertakings of this nature,
but I must own that there are in your dispat,ches, certain things
which when applied to the test of my instructions from home give
birth to feelings of doubt and uneasiness, and these I think it incumbent upon me to point out to you with candor and explicitness in
order that we may be fully understood - You must be sensible,
Sir, that in giving their sanction to a cooperation with the exiled
Bashaw, Government did not contemplate the measure as leading
necessarily and absolutely to a rcinstatement of that Prince in his
rights on the regency of Tripoli - they appear to have viewed the
cooperation in question as a means, which provided there existed
energy and enterprize in the exile, & attachment to his person on
the part of his former subjects, might be employed to the common
furtherance and advance of his claims and of our cause, but without
meaning to fetter themselves by any specific or definite attainment
as an end, as the tenor of my instructions (whereof inclosed is an
extract) and the limited sum appropriated for that special purpose
clearly demonstrate - I fear by the convention you were about
to enter into with Hamet and by the complexion of other measures
that a wider range may have been taken than is consistent with the
powers vested in me for that particular object - These apprehensions may perhaps prove groundless on further representations from
you, but under my present impressions I feel it my duty to state
explicitly that I must withhold my sanction to any convention or

440

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 180L TO 1805

agreement committing the Lnited States or tending to impress upon
Hanlet Bashaw a conviction that we have bound ourselves to place h i
on the Throne - The consequences involved in such an engagement
cannot but strike you forcibly and a general riew of our situation
in relation to the reigning Bashaw, & our unfortunate countrymen
in Tripoly will be s a c i e n t to mark its inexpediency - I shall consider it my duty, as it certainly is my inclination to afford you every
aid compatible with the authority vested in me 6: commensurate
with the means placed at my dlsposal and you may depend upon
the most active and vigorous support from the squadron as soon as
the season and our arrangements will permit us to appear in force
before the enemy's walls, but I wish you to understand that no
guarantee or engagements to the exiled prince, whose cause, I repeat
it, we are only favoring as the instrument to an attainment and not
in itself as an object, must be held to stand in the way of our acquescence to any honorable and advantageous terms of accommodation
which the present Bashaw may be induced to propose - Such
terms being once offered and accepted by the representative of Government appointed to treat of peace, our support to Hamet Bashaw
must necessarily be withdrawn - You u-ill not however conclude
that these considerations, important and necessary as they are, ought
to induce us at once to abandon the benefits which the measures
you have adopted seem to promise - I consider a perse~erancein
these by no means incompatible with a total freedom from any
tramels with respect to a definite object, which freedom I dcem it all
important to preserve, especially when I *view the paritcular situation in which Captain Bainbridge and his feUow sufferers may be
placed by this cooperation - If by your energy and exertions added
to the supplies now sent forward, you succeed in getting possession
of Derne & Bengazi we may calculate that having received this
impuise from our strength, he will possess in himself sufficient energy,
courage Sr, talent, and, if accounts are correct, sufficient interest
among the people to move on with firm steps, and to conduct his
friends and adherents to the gates of Tripoli Every support will
of course be given him by a systematic union of operations uith
the squadron so as to enable him to come upon the rear of the town but should the Bashaw be found deficient in these essential qualities
or that it appears that we have been deceived with regard to the
disposition of the inhabitants, he must be held as an unfit subject
for further support or co-operation - I beg leave to mention to you
that as w-e are short of officers the services of all will be called for on
board the respective ships as soon as we enter upon offensive measures - Should yoa concieve however that any serious disadvantage may result from withdrawing those with you, I have no objection to their remaining as volunteers, but it is impossible for me to
comply with your requisition for one hundred marines to be sent
to the coast - Such a step in the present posture of affairs far
exceeds my powers, and besides, as we are in want of hands 1 could
not feel myself justifiable in detaching so considerable force from
the squadron - I have not been unmindful of your requisition of
field artilery which I think with you is essential, but here it is impossible to procure it, I therefore dispatched some days since the Congess
Frigate to Messina where I hope to obtain four field pieces complete

WARS WITH BARBARY POWEaS

for service, and as soon as they arrive they will be sent to the coast
with the necessary amunition As I am still too unwell to write you with my own hand, I must
refer you to Captain Hull, in whose judgement and discretion I have
the most entire confidence, for information on several collateral
points and for my sentiments on others - In this letter I have
endeavoured to explain as clearly as possible what are my ideas
with respect to the wishes & intentions of our government, and what
I feel to be the extent of my authority touching the cooperation with
Hamet Bashaw - I reiterate to you my fixed resolution to afford
you every support and assistance, which are consistent with the
powers intrusted to me adding a t the same time my dissent from
any guarantee covenant or engagement by which the United States
mag stand committed to place the exiled Prince on the throne, or
any conditions which militate against the most perfect and uncontroled power of choice and action in concluding a pacification with
Joseph Bashaw, should he offer terms honorable and advantageous
to our country I should be wanting in justice to you, Sir, as well as to the officers
who have thus far shared your toils and dangers, were I not to express
my full reliance on your Courage, Energy and Perseverance, as well
as my ardent desire that your most sanguine expectations mayebe
realized - The observations I here convey to you are far from be~ng
intended to cool your zeal or discourage your expectations, but they
are what I concieve it necessary to make and drawn from me by the
purest feelings of duty, and as such permit me to recommend them to
your calm and candid consideration, and request you will make them
the subject of conversation with Captain H. who is fully possessed of
my sentiments.
As in enterprizes similar to that you are engaged in much is left to
fortune, so also much is dependent on the operation of circumstances hence the impropriety of tying you down with positive instructions
Many things must necessarily occur in which your judgement and d ~ cretion alone can be your guide, and indeed your further proceedings
will depend so completely upon events and circvmstances impossible
for me to estimate or foresee that I must consider myself rather as
your Counsellor than your director - Enclosed you will find a letter
to Hamet Bashaw, which please to have interpreted to him - i t is
left open for your perusal - Should you have reached Derne or Bengazi in safety and established yourselves there, you will detail to
Captain Hull as minutely as possible the nature and place of your
further operations as well as your ideas and wishes respecting our
naval cooperations, and dispatch one or both vessels (accordingly as
may be agreed upon betwixt Cap: Hull and yourself) to inform me of
your situation and prospects The Bashaw's secretary goes in the Argus - He has conducted
himself with great propriety here, and I am much pleased with his
manners and respectable appearance .Captain Hull will acquaint you with any thing worthy of remark
that has happened in our affairs - I need hardly say how anxious
I feel for further intelligence from you - I bee you will present my
respects to your brother Officers and that you will believe me with the
most sincere wishes for and inte-t
in your safety and success

Two negroes were hung at the gate of the city for robbery.
The Bashaw's son-in-law who had been sent into the country to
collect troops to protect Tripoli, returned without success. The people
refused to fight for the Bashaw, because he had made unusual demands
for money, and even had stripped their wives of their jewels. For
several days, it had been reported that ten thousand troops were to
muster on the beach near the town; and his highness was to make
a speech to encourage them to fight for him against the Americans and
his brother. I prepared myself to see these troops; but to my disappointment not one of them appeared.

Marched 12%miles. - At 3 p. m. arrived a t an extensive inclined
plain, bordering on the sea, called in Arabic Oak kerar ke barre, amidst
camps of numerous Brabs, consisting of three tribes of the Eu ed alli
race, supposed to amount to the number of 3 or 4,000 souls, inclusively,
covering a ground in a detached manner of 19 or twenty leagues
circumference. Here were vast herds of camels, horses and cattle,
and innumerable Bocks of sheep and goats. - We were the first
Christians ever seen by these wild people. - We were viewed by
them as curiosities. - They laughed at the oddity of our dress;
gazed a t our polished arms with astonishment: - at the same time
they observed the greatest deference towards such of us as bore any
distinctive marks of office. - They bro't us for sale everything their
camps afforded, and as rarities offered us young gazels and ostriches. But, being destitute of cash, we could only exchange our rice for their
produce. - We found dates here, which were brought five days
joufney from the interior of Africa, of an excellent quality. A11 our
gram (barley and beans) for the horses exhausted. Dispatched a
courier with letters to Captain Hull a t Bomba.

from Captain Samuel Banon, U. S. Navy

SIR,By the accompaning communications to Mr Eaton and to his
Excellency Hamet Bashaw, which are left open for your perusal, and
the personal knowledge you possess of my sentiments and wishes you
will be able to form a correct and to yourself satisfactory Idea of the
Brig Argus
service on which you are destined, with the United Stmates
& Sloop Hornet (Lieutenant Evans) under your Command. Its execution must necessarily depend so much on a Variety of
events and circumstances which may happen and it, is probable have
happened to M Eaton & his CqAdjetures and which we are totally
as well
unable to foresee, or to estimate, that I feel the impra~tibalit~y
as the unsuitableness of tying you down with precise and positive
instructions, hence you will perceive Sir, that your own judgment
and discretion, in which allow me to assure you I entertain the highest
confidence will frequently be your sole directors Agreeably to what we have agreed upon, you are directed to shape
your course for Bomba, or its vicinity and endeavour to establish an
immediate Communication with the Bashaws Army. - If they have
succeeded in penatring beyond Bomba, you will there obtain correct
information of their movements, which in all probability will be
towards Derne or Bengaize, whither you will of course follow with
your Vessels, unless you find contrary instructions from Mr Eaton -

H a ~ n opened
g
an intercourse with that Gent.leman, you will asscertain correct1 from him the posture of affairs and prospects of success,
end you wdfif he require it, land and deliver to him the stores and
Cash, under your charge, taking the necessary Receipts & Vouchers
As you will perceive by my Letter to M-aton I have left the application of these Succours, and consequently the responsibility wholly
to him, which I conceive proper, as well on account of his having the
cheif direction of the Land operations, as that by the time you arrive
on the coast, he will have it in his power to form a just estimate of
the chances of success, and thence, how far it is safe & expedient to
pursue the object. - Should it be determined to persevere, you are
authorised to afford him every support & assistance, consistant with
yours means and situation You will confer together, and obtain the most minute and circumstantial information, as to his future plan, and his ideas and
wishes with regard to Naval co-operation
On t.he Subject of your return it is impossible for me to furnish you
with precise Orders as it will depend altogether on the situation in
which you find matters on the coast, and the nature of the arrangements to be made with hlr Eaton - You will be aware of my anxiety
to hear from you - you will therefore dispatch the Sloop to this
place, or return with the Brig as Circumstnnces may direct. I n case of any unfortunate event having happened to Mr Eaton and
his Companions, and you can obtain no satisfactory intelligence of
them, it is left to you to act as you may think most adviseable. [NDA. Isaac Hull LB, 1803-1806.1

the Officers attached to said Yard or Garrison, with the use of the
ground thereto belonging - At the same time I confess, I told Mr

I did rather than let a man have it for $80. Offered in my presence,
at the same time I declare I never expected he would call on me for

sufficient security to indemnify the public in the event of desertion.
You may also, should you find it necessary to enable you to enter the

By the Mails of this morning we have received a Letter from Commodore Barron from Malta, in date of the 2"g Instant, advising that he
had given instructio~lsto Captain James Barron, Commanding the
Frigate Essex, to proceed up the Adriatic, on particular Service not
further explained. We have also Letters from George Dyson EsqQf Syracuse dated

EsqQf Naples - for Four Thousand Dollars, which Drafts have already appeared, and have been duly honoured, - and a t maturity
will be duly forwarded to us by Mr Degen who will take his Reimbursement on us for the Same. Mr Dyson informs that all the Squadron were then at Sea, except
the Frigate Congress, - The Nautilus Schooner, he mentions being
i n our h'eighborhood. - She has not however made her appearance
here; - We presume She is in search of the Two Tripolitans which
are reported to have been seen off Corsica, some time since. - The
Master of a n American Merchant Ship, who arrived with us three
weeks ago, spoke with an English Frigate between this, and Toulon,
the Commander of which gave information of the circumstance. This account accords with a similar one brought to Palermo sometime
past by another English Frigate, who spoke them, then off Sardinia. They are said to be both Polacca Rigged, and carry each Six Guns
and Fifty Men, &- on first appearance shew Tunisian Colours but by
their manoeuvres, they exhibited Suspicion in the breast of the English
Commander, who in consequence brought them to, for examination,
and they confessed on finding i t was an English Cruizer they were
Tripolines in search of Americans We hope soon to have a favorable account of them, when we shall
lose no time in communicating it

A courier from Derne, in the interest of the Bashaw, brings intelligence that five hundred of Joseph Bashaw's cavalry, accompanied
by great numbers of Arabs, both horse and foot, were a few days
march from that place, and would certainly arrive before i t would
be possible that we could. - The alarm excited by this information
arrested our motions. The Bashaw seemed to hessitatc whether to
proceed farther. - The camel drivers fled with their caravan: and there seemed to be a combination among the Bashaw's people
and the Arabs of Behara to return to Piaum. I again suspended
their rations; forbidding any more issues till the caravan should
return and the march proceed ahead. A council was held: - despondency sat in every countenance. About eleven a. m. I learned
that the Chiek il Taiib had resolved to proceed no farther until
certain intelligence arrive of our vessels being at Bomba. I could
not but reproach that chief with want of courage and fidelity. He had promised much ancl fulfilled nothing. - I regretted having
been made ac uainted with him: - and should be well satisfied if
he would put is menace in execution of returning to Egypt, provided he would not interfere with the dispositions of other ch~efs.
He quit the camp in a ra e, swearing by all the force of his religion
to join us no more. - #he Bashaw would have sent an officer to
pacify and bring him back. - I objected. - And he took himself off

The Chiek il Taiib excited an insurrection among the Arabs of this
place who had engaged to proceed with us; drew off half their number;
and, putting himself a t their head, started for Egypt. - The Bashaw
sent a messenger to me praying that I would dispatch an officer to
request him in my name to return. - I answered that no consideration whatever could prevail on me to ask as a favor what I claimed
as a right. The services of that chief were due to us: - We had
paid for them: - and he had pledged his faith to render them with
fidelity. - I t did not belong to him, at this period, to make terms
nor dictate measures: I should not debase myself to propose an accommodation. The Bashaw was apprehensive that he would turn his
influence and take a part against us. - Let him do it. - I like a n
open enemy better than a treacherousfriend. - W h e n he shaU hane taken
this ground i t zuiU perhaps, give me an opportunitg to punish event*
what I w d d do summarily zf the respect I had for his ExceUency did not
prevent it. - I hud. a r i j e and a sabre true to their distance. - Catry
this message to the chief. - He was mad with rage; and swore vengeance against the Bashaw, and his Christian sovereigns, as he stiled
us. - I ordered a march. - We got underway ?4 past 7 am. At
10 a messenger came from the Chiek to assure us that he had taken up
his march for Behara. Since he has taken that rout I have nothingfurther with him but to take
steps for the recoveq of the cash and property he has fraudulently drawn
from me. Continued the march. At 12 oclock another messenger"The Chiek il Taiib will join if the camp halt seasonably." The
Bashaw desired, & we halted a t $ past 12. About an hour & )h after
the Cheik hove in sight with his party; - soon after came up; - and,
presenting himself at my markee, with visible chagrin in his countenance, said, "You see the influence I have among these people!"

S. C. March the 28th 1805
SIR I had the honor to receive your Letter of the 14tQInstant,
yesterday, covering a plan for the Rigging a Gun Boat, from Commodore pribble, and Cap: Tingey; which on consideration, I should
have adopted for hT? 9 with some very trifling alteration, had I have
recieved it a few days sooner; as I believe it to be a good one; and
shall pay all the attention to it which so important a subject requires.
It may possibly admit of some improvement, or alterations, hereafter, after the experiment shall have been fairly tryed. I n my next
I shall be more explicit; I am very sure however that my opinion for,
or against, the proposed plan, coming from two such experienced
Commanders (for the Rigg of our Gun Boats) can neither add, nor
diminish any thing relative to this very important subject. Immediately on the Receipt of your Letter to me of the 11 th Instant I gave
directions for the new Gun Boat. (When I found She was intended
to cross the Atlantic) to be Rigged into a Ketch; and conformable to this,
arrangements were made, with the Spar Maker, Sail Maker, Rigger, &c
&c. for that purpose; And on the Receipt of your last Letter to me
the Rigger had already cut and partly fixed the principal Rigging
and other parts of this plan were in such a state of forwardness that I
did not think it warrantable in me as an oscer (and in whom you had
placed so much codidence) without positive orders - to persue a
new plan - besides, had I have done it it would have put the U. S.
to a n extra expence of several Hundred Dollars. - and being fully
persuaded that the present plan which I have adopted - for Sparing,
Rigging &c, of the new Gun Boat, will be upon consideration, approved
of by you Sir - (as it is already here by the best informed practical
Gentlemen, - and is perfectly a safe one in my opinion considering
the nature of the service on which She is to be sent! ! !

the season of the year is greatly in our favour although I have frequently experienced very bad weather in May and June
As to her rigging I cannot think any alteration necessary and what

Junior have been delivered to me by Mr k i a n c e our Charge des

M Pun-iance being in ill health and having retired a few Miles
from this city has directed me to attend to the commission, & has
also given me two Bills remitted from Baltimore one for Â£39.14.2, the
other for Â£39.18.9, which have been duly accepted, and will be applied
to the purchase of these articles.
I have presumed that you woud wish them to be made somewhat
emblematical, & as highly ornamented as the price allowed for them

meet with your approbation; The one which is completed I take an
opportunity of sending by a Mr Patton who goes immediately to
Alexandria, the other shall be forwarded by the next suitable

in aptivity. The great difliculty of forwarding letters to Tripoli will readily
account to you for your not having heared oftner from me, and especially as I had nothing to communicate which would have been particularly interesting
I assure you my dear Bainbridge that no One feels more deeply
interested than myself in the liberation of yourself and Your unfortunate Companions, and I sincerely hope that the present season will
effect that desireable object. We have a very Considerable Force now
in this Sea, which, if exercised, must be productive of all the fatal
effects of War; for our Country will never admit of any terms of
peace which shall not be honorable and as permanent as we can
expect. - We consider Ourselves as having been unjustly forced into
this war; and therefore we do not look so much to the expences which
may attend it, as to the establishment of a Peace upon terms which
are cornpatable with the rising Character of our Nation, and which
will secure a future peace upon honorable and lasting grounds. Had we counted on the expence alone it would have been better to
have made peace at the price of half a Million of dollars You will receive hence a number of Articles which I trust will be
highly acceptable to yourself our Officers and Crew; and by the return
of this Vessel I hope we sha hear of your welfare, and that you still
keep up your Spirits, under a full reliance that the Great Author &
director of Events will shortly cause your liberation to be effected,
and that you may once more enter into the arms of your friends and
the bosom of your Country.
As you will receive many letters by this opportunity I shall add no
more at present but the earnest prayers and best wishes of Mr? Lear
and myself. that all good may attend you, Your Officers and all our
Citizens who suffer under that deplorable State of bondage
(Thefollowing was written to Cap? B. wt@invisible Ink)
I have been here since Octr last, and have had strong hopes that
some event would have brought me to see you before this time; but
I have been disappointed. - We made last year several propositions
to the Bashaw, which were rejected by him, and which will not be
renewed by us unless some unforseen accident should happen to our
Ships here to prevent their operating with their full force. - If the
Bashaw wishes for peace it now remains for him to come forward;
and if the terms are such as we can admit, he will fmd no disposition
on Our part to refuse them; or to Continue the War; altho' our force
is now such as we might fairly Calculate upon to destroy his Batteries and Town. The very ill state of the Commodore's health has been most sincerely felt; but as the Winter is Not the season for action the same
evil will not result therefrom as would have been experienced a t any
Other time. He is now recovering. Mr Higgins will send a bill for twelve hundred dollars from the
Danish Consul here on Mr Nissen for your use, and he tells me that
the English Consul in Tripoli has nine hundred dollars in his hands for
the same purpose. Mr Davis has been furnished by me from this

1 perceived a manifest reluctance in the Bashaw to advance, and evident calculations for a retrograde march. Joseph Bashaw's
forces had siezed on all his nerves. - He now took from my officers
the horses he had given them for the passage through the desert
and gave them to some of his footmen. - Drew off his Mohametans
and stood balancing, after theJfoops were drawn up for the march. I reproached him with indecision, - want of perserverance, - and
of consistency in arrangement. - I demanded the horses for my
officers. - High words insued. - I ordered the march in front. The Bashaw retrograded. - We proceeded in front with the baggage. The Bashaw came up in about two hours, and, making us
some compliments for our firmness, said he was obliged to dissemble
an acquiesance in the wishes of his people to render them manageable.
We proceeded 12;: miles to a castle Shemees, & camped at one oclock

MONTICELLO,
March 29, 1805.

DEARSIR,

The war with Tripoli stands on two grounds of fact. 1st. It is
made known to us by our agents with the three other Barbary States,
that they only wait to see the event of this, to shape their conduct
accordingly. If the war is ended by additional tribute, they mean
to offer us the same alternative. 2ndly. If peace was made, we
should still, and shall ever, be obliged to keep a frigate in the Mediterranean to overawe rupture, or we must abandon that market.
Our intention in sending Morris with a respectable force, was to try
whether peace could be forced by a coercive enterprise on their town.
His inexecution of orders baffled that effort. Having broke him, we
try the same experiment under a better commander. If in the course
of the summer they cannot produce peace, we shall recall our force,
except one frigate and two small vessels, which will keep up a perpetual blockade. Such a blockade will cost us no more than a state
of peace, and will save us from increased tributes, and the disgrace
attached to them. There is reason to believe the example we have
set, begins, already to work on the dispositions of the powers of
Europe to emancipate themselves from that degrading yoke. Should
we produce such a revolution there, we shall be amply rewarded for
what we hare done. Accept my friendly salutations, and assurances
of great respmt and esteem.

Proclamation of William Eaton to the Inhabitants of Tripoli
[Transbtion.]

To the inhabitants of the kingdom of Tripoli:
Brothers; Sons of Abraham; true believers of the true messengers of
the truth! I have come to you, sent by a natioq very far away from
your country, to greet you and to wish you happmess.
At the uttermost limits of the west, beyqnd the great and deep
Atlantic Ocean, we have for several centuries possessed a country
larger than the whole empire of the Grand Signor. We were formerly
composed of many elements. We grew, and we were beset by enemies
within and without. But we banded ourselves together and we gave
battle to them in man bloody encounters. We put them to flight;
and God, the God of A raham, whom we worship, it was his will that
we should settle there; and we became a united nation. Since that

1

468

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1804 TO 1806

epoch we have been called the United States qf America. We sought
peace with the whole world and we were happy in obtainin it. Soon
the United States of America became a sanctuary for a men who
fled from oppression and sought asylum there, and a refuge for those
who had no other country. People of every nation, every tongue and
every faith could come to us and dwell in safety, because our religion
teaches us to fear and to worship God and to be kind to all his creatures. MTeprofess the orthodox faith of Abraham which was not idolatrous. We believe in God and the revelations which he made through
Abraham and Israel and Isaac and Jacob and the tribes, and in that
which he reve4ed to the prophets. We make no distinction, and we
me resigned to the will of God.
Thus, being just to all, we lived for years a t peace with everybody.
We cultivated our soil and we sent products to all nations, and all
loolr upon us with the eyes of friendship and without jealousy. But
although we endeavored to maintain in good faith friendly relations
with all the powers of the earth, and while we offered the olive branch
of friqdship to all, Joussuf, the traitor, usurper of the throne of
Tripoli, a bloodthirsty scoundrel, having learned of our success, of our
wealth and of our ships which carry on trade in the Mediterranean,
mistrusting our peaceful inclinations and even mistrusting the justice
of God, sent out his armed pirate ships against our commerce and
even brought some of our ships into the port of Tripoli, and without
provocation had their crews put in chains and reduced to slavery;
thereby outraging every obligation of honor and decency, and transgressing against the law of God which forbids us to be the first in
aggression. Kevertheless, we did not wish to inflict on him the punishment which his crimes and his acts of violence merited, because
we realized the grievous error of making many worthy and honest
subjects of Tripoh, who had done us no harm, share his fa,te; on the
contrary, we sent him messengers of-peace with fair words and briwing him rich gifts of gold, silver, precious jewels and fine English cloth.
Joussuf, the traitor, on his part, after having heard our friendly words
sad accepted our presents, took an oath in the name of God and his
prophet to maintain with US a firm and lasting peace; he released our
brothers, who were in chains; and we left him, believing the promises
which he had made us. Scarcely had we returned home, when this
faithless traitor went to work and had all his pirate ships fitted out,
appointing foreign captains to command them, scoundrels who had
just escaped from certain Christian countries to evade the punishment
which their crimes merited, and having won over to his side bad
characters among the subjects of Tripoli, a t another time caused
war to be made on the United States, and p~raticallycaptured some
of our vessels and some of our brothers and reduced them to slavery.
B u t he had aroused the wrath of God, for Joussuf, the traitor, had
taken oath in the name of the Almighty to faithfully observe the
covenant of peace which he had entered into with us. Again we sent
him friendly messengers to ask him the reason of this new outrage and
violation of good faith. It is then that we learned that this same
Joussuf had been fmm his birth a miscreant, a murderer, a perjurer,
and an oppressor of the people. We were apprised of the cruel manner
in which he killed his younger brother even in his mother's arms; that
he had poisoned his brother, for which he is accursed of God; and that
he had betrayed and dethroned his elder brother, himself taking

lf

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS

469

possession of the throne in violation of his duty towards his lawful
sovereign, who has now returned in order to revenge himself for the
wrong done him by the said traitor. That he always disdained the
counsels of true believers, lending his ears to hypocrites and to vagabonds who did nothing but flatter his vanity and his self-esteem in
the hope of sharing with him in the spoils of his piracy and the fruits
of his avarice, among whom there is Morad Reis, a renegade thief
from his youth up and a brutal drunkard whom the said Joussuf had
appointed as his Captain Bey. Furthermore, that he permitted himself to be led by Jews, Farfara and others, whose sole desire was to
encourage him to commit outrages against foreign nations so that
they might be able to stir up enemies against true believers. Nevertheless, we chose rather to offer peace to him than to mete out to him
the punishment merited by his misdeeds, because our religion teaches
us patience, and forbids us to shed the blood of the innocent, such as
the inhabitants of the kingdom of Tripoli, who had never wanted to
do us any harm, and whom the said Joussuf, the traitor, wished to
prevail upon to fight against their will. But he would not listen to
our offers of peace, or a t least only on such humiliating terms as
paying him an enormous sum of money and making ourselves m d
even our posterity his tributaries; which we disdained to concede to
him, for we are not accustomed to humiliate ourselves before men,
nations, nor the powers of the earth; much less before this base and
perjured traitor, whose naval commander is a drunken renegade, and
whose principal counsellor is a grasping Jew.
Know you not, you inhabitants of Tripoli and of all the neighboring countries, that it is through the just retribution of the Lord for
the bloody crimes of the said traitor that you are obliged to suffer the
scourges of famine and of war! You will again be visited by pestilence if you fail to avenge yourselves on this brazen usurper! Did he
not ally himself with infidel Jews to despoil you of your possessions!
Has he not turned over to them all the trade and commerce of your
country, thereby depriving you of all honest means whereby you
could earn money; and in order to enrich himself by a piratical and
unjust war, did he not lead you to the battlefield to die like cattle, on
false pretexts of religion. If you were to fall into the hands of his
enemies, would he pay one piaster to ransom you from slavery? No,
he sells you and your children to the enemies which he has made for
you. He leads you into war with no advantage to you whatever. He
does not hesitate to drench his shores with your blood, provided that he
be able to gain money by it! Yes, he scoffs a t your sufferings, saying:
Of what value are these Moors and these Arabs! They are just
beasts which belong to me, worth a reat deal less than my camels and
my asses. Let them all perish, if o y I be able to gain money thereby.
And his Jews also scoff while he is playing this tragic farce, he dares
to outrage the goodness of God by giving to his bloodthirsty avarice
the sacrilegious name of religion! Oh, Moors, oh, brabs, can you
calmly behold the shedding of your children's blood, without avenging
yourself! \Till you meekly allow them to be put in chains and reduced
to slavery in order to satisfy the cruel and savage cupidity of a usurper,
a traitor, a barbarian, who fears not the Lord and who has no regard
for human rights! No. The voice of God and the voice of justice
should inspire you with a desire for vengeance, even the blood of his
father and of his brother, assassinated by his own hands, cries to

f

470

heaven and to you for vengeance; and the groans of some of your own
brothers whose lives he sacrificed in an unjust war have risen to the
throne of the King to accuse him on the day of judgment. They
have been heard and Joussuf stands condemned. God has stamped
upon his forehead the mark of Cain, the first murderer. The measure
of the wickedness of his days has become full to overflowing; the end
of his usurpation and of his cruelty approaches; and woe to all those
who would strive to prevent the punishment which God has meted
out to him. The wrath of God has been aroused against the said
Joussuf, the Lreacherous scoundrel, because he wished to make you
believe that we Americans were enemies, of true believers; and God
has ordained that we never make peace m t h the said traitor, nor even
with subjects of Tripoli who belong to his party. But with Sidi Hamet
Caramanli Bashaw we wish to cultivate peace and amity as well as
with those of his subjects who desire to rejoin his cause, in order to
aid him in putting down the usurper and in re-establishing on his
throne, this lawful soverei , t,he first-born of his father, a just and
merciful prince, who great y loves his subjects, and who will faithfully observe and keep his covenants forever. Come on, Moors,
Arabs, Americans, brothers, come along from every corner of Barbary
where the truth of the prophet has been received. Be assured that the
God of the Americans and of the Mahometans is the same; the one
true and omnipotent God. Be assured, therefore, that there was no
thought of any difference in religion which could have induced us to
make war on the city of Tripoli and on its piratical ruler; on the contrary, we do not wish to harm any of the inhabitants of that city,
unless it be those who stubbornly adhere to the party of Joussuf;
we are joined and united with Sidi Hamet Pasha, and thus with the
loyal children of his country; and we are rcsolved to re-establish him
in the realm of his ancestors, by this means being able to offer peace
to his kingdom and to his city of Tripoli. Great, good and powerful
is our admiral, to whom we have entrusted the command of the American squadron in the Mediterranean, and always ready to assist you.
We shall furnish you with war supplies and with food supplies, with
money, and in case of need with regular soldiers to aid you in vanquishing your enemy, your oppressor. And I shall be always with you until
the end of the war and even until you have achieved your glorious
mission, in proof of our fidelity and our goodwill.
Be faithful unto God. Be loyal to the Grand Signor. Be loyal to
the rightful prince, Hamet Bashaw of Tripoli, and let us not doubt
that the Almighty will rant us his succor and his assistance to accomplish his wishes. A fasting peace; free and extensive trade, wealth
and fidelity will be the result.

without bastions, and one hundred feet square, there seems to be some
trade with the inhabitants of the interior of Africa. - We find here
cattle, sheep, butter, fowls, eggs and dates, but very dear; and for
which we bartered rice a t great disadvantage. - The situation is
enchanting; vast plains, capable of high cultivation; - good well
water; - and some enclosed gardens of small fig and palm trees. But everything bears the ruinous aspect of ravage and war. - About
four p. m. Hamet Gurgies came up with the Arabs who seperated
themselves from us on the 27th. [H. E. Huntington L&AG, EA 206.1

SIR - I am happy to have it in my power to announce to you that
the John Adams is completely ready for the reception of her stores
The different store rooms cable stages &q &q are all compleated, the
Ship has been cleaned out and washed the ballast restowed and an
additional quantity taken in, we have also got 90 tons of Shingle
ballast in and the ground tier of Water cask stowed,
The Masts and Yards have all be[en] stripped and the rigging all
been overhauled We have now every thing on and the yards across
are ready to bend sails and I have no hesitation in saying that the Ship
could proceed to sea in six days if her provisions and men were here. L+Maxwell has entered upwards of two hundred men and boys out
of which number we have received on board 50 Seamen 120 Ordinary
Seamen & 18 Boys I have been under the necessity of entering a Master's Mate as we
had no Midshipmen who was competent to that duty - he has
commanded a Ship out of this port and appears like a smart active
man, there have been several applicants for Master's Mate's birth
by people who I think would be an acquisition to the service in that
grade
I wish that Mr Carr could join the Ship as soon as possible as Mr
Darby has made his accounts up and has now nothing to do with the
victualling the Ship

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1804 TO 1805

Extract from journal of William Eaton, U. 8. Navy Agent for the Barbary Regencies,
Saturday, SO March 1805

At 6. a. m. Resumed our march with the Christians and baggage,
leaving the Bashaw to follow with his Arabs, who were mounted for
the purpose. - At this instant a dispute arose between the Chiek
il Taiib and Chaik Mahomet concerning the distribution of $1500; which the former had received of the Bashaw to be equally distributed;
a part of which he had concealed; and grew so warm that Mahomet
swore he would proceed no farther. - Three other Chaiks and several other considerable Arabs took part with him, and retrograded.
The Bashaw in vain endeavored to reconcile the parties. - Chiek
Mahomet persisted in quitting the expedition; & with his party moved
rapidly off. The Bashaw left them, & hastily pursued us, with a view
of arresting our march; having sent back Hamet Gurgies and two
other officers to endeavor to recover the malcontents. We had
gained fifteen miles ahead when he came up with us a t 2 oclock p. m.
But it was necessary to retrograde three miles to water, and there
camp. - The expedition could not proceed without those chiefs, as
they had many people and powerful influence with the eu ed alli
tribes near Derne, to which they belong. Pitched our camp at 5 p. m.
The Bashaw with twelve horsemen and my interpreter returned to
the castle in hopes of reconciling the shieks and of bringing up their
party. This will detain us tomorrow. - From Alexandria to this
place we have experienced continual altercations, contentions and
delays among the Arabs. They have no sense of patriotism, truth nor
honor; and no attachment where they have no prospect of gain, except
to their religion, to which they are enthusiasts. - Poverty makes
them thieves; and practice renders them adroit in stealing. - The
instant the eye of vigilance is turned from an object on which they
have fixed a desire, it is no more to be found: - Arms, amunition
and provisions most engage their furtive speculations; but sundry of
our people have been robbed of their cloaths and other articles. With all their depravity of morals they possess a savage independence
of soul, an incorrigible obstinacy to discipline, a sacred adherence to
the laws of hospitality, and a scrupulous pertinacity to their religious
faith & ceremonies. - Day before yesterday I was admitted, as a
mark of special distinction, within the walls of their castle. Curiosity brought every Arab about me who belonged to the tribe. They examined the lace of my hat, epauletts, buttons, spurs and
mounting of my arms. These they took to be all gold and silver.
They were astonished that God should permit people to possess such
riches who followed the religion of the devil!
My interpreter explained that the religion of the Americans was
different from that of all other nations who wore hats; (the hat and
turban are distinguishing marks of Christian and Turk:) that we
believed in God and respected all his revelations; that we made no
distinction in our respect to people of different creeds; all were free
with us to worship God as their consciences dictated; and that all
honest men were equally respected in America.

inform Com Preble that if a person came here that Peace would be
effected for 150 thousand dollars, Since the date of my last the said
minister in confidence has informed me that he did thus request Mr
Beaussier but does not know if Com Preble received the information.
The Minister is sincerely desirous for Peace it is his interest greatly
to have it You no doubt will be informed by Com Barron of the overtures which he has made to him, I have in my letters to Com B been
very explicit which I presume that you will be informed of The reports
of the Commodores force is greatly exagerated and the apprehension

SIR! AS soon as the U. States Frigate under your Command is
ready for Sea, you are directed to proceed off the Harbor of Tripoli
taking under your Convoy the Ketch Eiiza with Supplies for the
American Prisoners - On falling in with the Constellation you will
assume her station, and direct Cap! Campbell to return immediately
to this Port or to Syracuse. - As the Crew of that Ship have been
affected with the Small Pox, I suggest to you the propriety of her
going into Syracuse in preference to this place; however you will ascertain from Cap! Campbell the present state of his Crew, & give him
such Written Instructions on this head as you may think proper. You are directed to retain the Brig Vixen on the Station, until she is
relieved by some of the Small Vessels The Nautilus may be expected here from Sicily in four or five days
and it is my present intention to dispatch her immediately to the
Coast of Tripoli for that purpose.
When you arrive off the Station you will adopt such Dispositions
for blockading the Enemy's Harbour and scouring the Coast as you
may deem expedient Accompanying the Present you will find a Letter from M' Davis at
Tunis dated the StQ UltQ,giving an account of the two Tripoline Corsairs that have taken shelter in that Regency - they remained in
the same situation on the l g t Qwhen the Nautilus left the Bay Should the Winds prove favourable it may not be inadvisable for you
or the smaller Vessel to stretch towards Sousa and from thence to look
into Tunis Bay in order to watch their motions - The propriety of
this arrangement will depend upon circumstances, you will therefore
act in it at your own Discretion The term of your Cruize I leave entirely to yourself as well as the
general dispositions - I shall dispatch the President Frigate to join
you as soon as possible & whenever you think the Coast sufficiently
guarded, you will return to this Island or to Syracuse as circumstances
& arrangements may direct [LC. JRP. Letters & Orders, Book A, 1804-1805.1

proached him as the cause of all our delays in the march, and with a
total failure of all his engagements with me. - He had engaged me
four hundred mounted Arabs of his tribe at the Marabout and to
bring me to Bomba in fourteen da s. - His whole number of men
consisted of but twenty eight; we ad now been twenty five days in
gaining half our distance: - and, in stead of encouraging our progress,
he was on all occasions throwin obstacles in our way. - He recriminated the Bashaw and other s7.lieks. - I thought the Bashaw and
shieks he accused better men than himself; and would not hea[r] them
calumniated. He believed me partial. I said to him, if he had experienced any evidence of my partiality it was in his favor until after
his hypocricy betrayed itself. - I t was true I now held him in no
consideration, for I could place no reliance in any thing he said or
undertook. - He seemed ver indifferent about the opinion I entertained of him, provided he cou d obtain his object. - He cautioned
me against persisting in the resolution I had taken not to augment the
ration; it would unavoidably produce an insurrection. The other
shieks & caravan would leave me. As for himself, he could not subsist on rice alone; he zoo& have bread also! I asked him if he thought
to compel the measure? He said, with a menacing tone, - Remember you are in a desert, and a country not your own. - I a m a greater
man here than either you or the Bashaw. I retorted, " I have fou~ldyou
at the head of every commotion which has happened since we left
Alexandria. - You are the instigator of the present among the
chiefs. - Leave my tent! but, mark; - if I find a mutiny in camp
during the absence of the Bashaw, I will put you to instant death as
the fomenter of it." - He left the tent; mounted his horse; and,
with two other shieks took himself off. The Bashaw's Hasnadar
(Treasurer) had been called into my tent on the entrace of the Shiek
il Taiib. - He had the influence to pacify the other chiefs, or to engage them to wait at least till the return of the Bashaw.
Now 10 oclock and no news of him.
2 oclock p. m. The Shiek il Taiib returned. - Entered into the
tent of my officers: - regretted that he had lost my confidence: apprehended that some secret enemy had insinuated unfavorable impressions against him: - was devoted to me: - would even abandon
the Bashaw to follow me: - and begged Mr. Barquhar and Peck to
use their influence for a reconciliation. 5.p.m. He came to my tent. Professed eternal obligations and
attachment. - Would seek every occasion to give proofs of it; and hoped that an oppertunity would offer to him a t Derne to convince
me that he was a man!
I replied that I required nothing of him by way of reconciliation
but truth, fidelity to the Bashaw, pacific conduct among the other
chiefs, uniformity and perserverance in this conduct. These he promised b an oath; and offered me his hand.
6 oc ock p.m. The Bashaw not returned: Apprehensive that he has
suffered himself to fall into a snare of his brother. - The day has
been rainy, blowing, and chill . Visited the Arab camp. &eir young men, young women & children are perfectly well made, and thou h copper coloured, are handsome. - Never saw teeth so universal y sound and white, even and
well set. The women do not veil: -have nothing of the affected

ment modest and bashful. I took dates in the tent of their principal
shiek. One of his wives served them in an ozier pannier, and seemed
elated with the visit. I complimented her elegant proportion and
symitry She smiled and said there were much handsomer young women
in c.amp than herself. - I doubted it. To give me proof, sundry

they were very handsome; but could not give up my first opinion. [H. E. Huntington L&AG, EA 206.1

Marched a t six a. m. Advanced only ten miles in front, when the
Arabs pitched their camp, and insisted on remaining here until they
could send a caravan five days march into the interior of the desert
to a place called Seewauh [Siwah] to procure dates. We were in a
valley upon the centre of a vast elevated plain, and haveexcellent
cistern water. - I urged the march ahead. - The Arabs positively
refused to proceed. - They were short of provisions, and had no
other resort. I said their wants would be supplied a t Bomba. They replied that this depended on contingency; we could not command the sea. - I threatened to take off the Christians. They
intreated I would halt till the next morning. - To this I consented,
on condition that they would solemnly promise to throw no more
impediments in the way of our progress to Bomba, and that they
would hereafter yield implicit obedience to my orders; threating a t
the same time to embark with the Bashaw and suit a t that place,
and proceed directly to Tripoli, leaving them to contend for the
provinces of Derne and Bengazi alone in case of any infraction of
these conditions. They pledged themselves; and we encamped. Their caravan went off for Seeu-auh, to join us again a t Bomba. The Arabs say that at that placc is a fountain, or lake of fresh water,
of three leagues circumference, which supplies a considerable territory
of good land by small rivulets descending from the mountains. I t
does not appear that this lake has any issue to the sea: but the truth
of its existence is supportcd by the excellent dates brought thence to
the castles on the seaboard for sale; a fruit only found on low, wellwatered ground.

Marched a t 6, A. M. Halted a t four afternoon. Gained eighteen
miles. This day Capt. Selem Comb chased down a wild cat with his
grey hound: height two feet; length from extremities five feet; color
sable, brindled about the body; black ears and nose, and dark brindled
tail: it was cooked, and i t eat very well. An Arab, soon after, brought
me a couple of her young; but they were not old enough to be raised.
At this camping ground are two remarkable wells, between &ety
five and a hundred feet deep, sunk through solid rock, except about
four feet a t the surface. The surrounding plains are a bed of marl0

"In my last I believe I informed you that capt. Eaton had gone to
Alexandria in Egypt to meet the cidevant Bashaw of Tripoli, brother
to the reigning Bashaw, since which the Argus has returned, and
brings letters from Eaton. He was received with much attention,
and appointed generallissimo by the Bashaw; he is now a t the head
of about six thousand men on his march for Tripoli, a distance of
1000 miles, he is supposed by this time to be a t Derne, a province of
Tripoli, about half way from Alexandria.
"The Argus has again been dispatched to Derne with provisions,
and the commodore has sent to Messina to purchase field pieces, &c.
Great hopes are entertained from this expedition. The reigning
Bashaw is much alarmed, and has put himself a t the head of his army
to oppose them.
"Commodore Barron continues very ill yet. The Constitution,
Constellation, and brig Vixen are now off Tripoli, from which he had
just returned; the Essex and Enterprise a t Venice and Trieste, expected
here daily-the Congress and Nautilus a t Syracuse or on their passage

vast cistern must have been supplied by rain water conveyed into

is dry. Around the castle are many ruins of ancient buildings, of

that in the ruins of Cartha e. Time in many places has consumed
the freestone of the walls, eaving the cement perfectly entire, and

in readiness for Sea in Ten days. (If no bad weather should prevent
it). We h&ve had some difficulty in procuring here all the Articles

which was wanted for her, and was obliged at length to accept of
some of an inferior kind because no better was to be had, I have
iven to the plan (sent to your department (for Rigging a Gun Boat)
Commodore Prebble and Cap$Tingey) all the consideration which
it meritted, and beg leave to give my opinion that it ought to be
adopted, with only one or two alterations which I think those Gentlemen will approve of and which I think will be an improvement
upon their Plan. It is this; instead of the Mast being placed in the
Center, let it be stepped N i n e or, T e n feet from the Center, towards
the advancing End of the Boat; - This will give her more after
Sail and She mill the more readily go in Stays. But If the Mast is in
the Center I think riggd as those Gentlemen propose She will work
heavily and will be liable to miss Stavs. If this suggestion of mine
should be approved of, I think it would be best to have the Shrouds

WILMINGTON
Ap! 6 t U 8 0 5

DEARSIR I received, a few days since, a letter from MT A Laws,
a young Friend of mine, a midshipman on board the Constitufion
Frigate, then a t Syracuse - his situation as it regards his rank is
certainly a delicate one, and will no doubt meet the attention of the
Sec? of the navy - h4.T Laws was first appointed in the navy on the
15@ of May 1800 as his warrant will shew - a t the time the naval
esthblishment was reduced, Geni Smith who then acted as the Sec'
in his selection of officers, which generally speaking was certainly a
very judicious one, omitted through mistake or for the want of proper
information this young Gentleman, who was then a t Pittsburg, with
his Friends, on leave of absence, and who was not acquainted with
this circumstance for months afterward; but was then waiting orders The winter following, I believe, or as soon a s i t was found that M'
Laws had been left out -I applied at his instance to Mr Rob? Smith
the Secu, to have him reenstaled in the navy, and I shortly afterwards
found him in service - but i t seems unfortunately, for the young
Gentleman, a new warrant was then issued to him, which places him
in date of warrant far behind those a-bo aciually entered the service
long after him - This as the See? will at once see, especially in the
day of promotion, must be an extremely mortifying circumstance to a
young man of great ambition &- high spirit, and altho' I well know that
the path he is at present pursuing to fame, is the pride of his soul,
may, I fear, unless some remedy can be provided for it, occasion his
leaving the service - I believe there is no man more sincerely attached
to the navy than myself, and I am well convinced that no sing10
circumstance can induce so much to its respectability, as the encouragement of young men of education, character & family to enter & continue in the service - hfr Laws has the support of these recommendations in a high degree and such are his easy circumstances in pecuniary
respects, that none but motives the most honorable could possibly
have influenced him in entering the navy - He went out the last
time with Commodore Prebble, was with Decatur a t the burning of
and has taken a gallant part in all the very distinthe Philad"
guished & honorable exploits of our brave Fellows in the Mediterranean - This information, or the latter part of it, I give froin some
of those officers who have returned - I had hoped that the midshipmen who were engaged in the burning of the Philad" would have
been promoted to Lieutenants - this would have relieved M' Laws,
I presume, from his difficulties as to the date of his warrant - should
this not be the fact I must beg you Sir to attend to the case & complaint of this young Gentleman - I hazard nothing in assuring
you that you have no Gentleman under your command more worthy
of your Patronage -

pressed & the principles laid down with respect to the plan in question
will meet your entire approbation - From the concurring information I have recently received from persons well acquainted with the
Bashaw of his Character & Conduct, I confess that my hopes from a
Cooperation with hi are less sanguine than they were -perhaps however I may shortly have reasons to raise my expectations to their former Standard, but until something occurs to 'ustif the belief that he
possesses more Courage, Energy and Talents t an t ose who appear to
know him well, give him Credit for, it wou'd be reprehensible to flatter
myself or the Government with prospects which the event may
diiappoin t
I am equally a t a loss to calculate the effects of this cooperation
with his Brother upon the mind of the reigning Bashaw - a short
time will throw light upon this interesting point; in the mean while,
I cannot conceal from you my candid opinion that from the obstinacy
hitherto evinced by Caromauli Bashaw and the pertinacity of his
Character not unmixed with bravery and other qualities belonging to
a Soldier, added to the natural advantages of his situation, the Contest promises to be more arduous than was at k t anticipated Our co-operation with Hamet may and in all probability will induce
him either to offer terms to us at once, or finding his Dominions menaced and his life endangered to put every thing to the hazard of War.
In the latter case we may naturally conclude that his resistance will
be not only obstinate but desperate. - I look with anxiety for the

Extract from journal of William Eaton, U.S. Navy Agent for the Barbary Regencies
6 April 1806

Last night a party of wild Arabs stole into the vicinity of our camp
and took off nine of the Bashaw's horses. A detachment was sent
this morning in search of them, which returned at twelve and reported
that they fell upon the trail of fifty horses, supposed to be mounted
by the thieves, which shaped a rapid course towards the interior of
the desert. The detachment was reenforced and returned on the
pursuit.
This morning died the saddle beast of one of my servants.
12 oclock at noon. After six hours march came to a well seventy
feet deep below which a large cistern of bad water, foeted and saline.
Our horses had not drunk during forty two hours - and the people
with much difficulty procured a little very nausious water from the
deep well near the castle last night. Every body pressed near the
well, the horses and people crouding upon each other for drink. In
the struggle the horse of my other servant was forced backwards
from the croud, and, the ground descending to the well, slipped and
went down with two cloaks, and perished in the fall. Continued our
march 17 miles, but advanced very little in front, having kept under
the side of the mountain to gain the seaboard. - Halted a t 3 p.m.
within four miles of the sea shore. I walked with Mr Farquhar and
a servant to the water side. - A very handsome bay formed by the
mountain which extends into the sea a league and an half, and terminates in a high cape. The Arabs call the port Salaum; I t is marked
on the French chart Cape Luco: They say it is remarkable for having been a shelter for the Malteese
cruisers. - Ninety miles from Bombay by calculation. We find no
water this night.

DEARSIR: Come Preble called on me to day, and it afforded me
real pleasure t,o converse with that intelligent officer on the various
subjects connected with his late instructions from the Navy Department, and in relation to our affairs in the Medetera. If a doubt ever
rested on the mind of any man (but none ever did on mine) of our
being able to dictate a peace to Tripoli, that doubt would be done
away upon hearing Come P. explain the situation of the place, the
inferiority of its force, & the impression that his bombardments made
on its government. Sure I am the American squadron now going
against it, aided with the gun boats & other force of that description
which will soon be on the spot, will be able to reduce it, & oblige it

having informed me that he found all the carpenters in
Boston engaged, so far that none of them would promise to undertake
to build the bomb-vessels immediately, and to complete them in 40
or 50 days, the time within which i t would be necessary for them to
sail for Tripoli, I went with him to one of our principal ship builders
in this town, to see if he wouid agree to build one of the boats in the
limitted time, and we found it could not be done, they can be built
in Boston, Salem, Newburyport, Portsmouth, Portland or at any of
our seaport towns, but not quite so soon as they are wanted, owing
to the greater part of the carpenters being engaged, still I am confident
men can be found who will finish the work in much less time than 3
months, because in that time an Indiaman could be built & put to
sea. Come P. will hurry the business all in his power, but we have
thought i t would aid the object in view if he was permitted to buy
two large sloops or Schooners (for whether they have one or two masts
is of no consequence) as he might happen to find suitable vessels, and
fix them up as bomb-vessels, they might be from 100 to 120 or 130
tons burden, rather over the size of the Sloops I recommended in my
last letter for gun boats, they can be bolt a t any hour in Boston or
the neighbouring towns, & can be readily fitted to receive mortars
or any heav cannon wanted for the service, it will be necessary to
lay them as ore, to double plank them outside, & strengthen them
inside with timber & plank, & to bolt & rivet the work together sufficiently secure to bear the shock of continued discharges from the
mortars, which can all be done, & the vessels certainly depart in a
month or 40 days a t most from the time they are purchased, I would
strongly advise to this plan, because they can be on the ground &
assist in the reduction of Tripoli this season, while the new bombvessels might not be completed so as to make it certain of being there
a t the attack, but the purchase of these boats, (for they are only
boats after all) need not prevent your building the bomb-vessels,
which may be still much wanted. my object in suggesting this plan
to you, is to be sure of having force enough off Tripoli before the
first of July. The gun boats from this Country will be excellent,
but you may want a greater force, especially of that description, to
throw heavy bombs, shells &?into the town & among the shipping. I mentioned to Come P that the New York North river sloops wG
make good gun boats, & I found he agreed with me most completely,
any vessels drawing little water & built after their model are fit for
gun boats, they only require to be fixed to receive the camon on deck,
& perhaps to be strengthened round the bows. At any rate I a~d
recommend you to send out from 4 to 6 of them in aid of the gun
boats, you may rely upon it they will be useful in the attack if you
order them prepared to receive a heavy cannon, & as I have previously observed this need not interfere the least with the gun boats
going out, for with 8 or 10 of these, & 3 or 4 sloops properly fixed,
& the two others fitted up for Mortar or Bomb-vesscls, you will have
a powerful force, & coo erating with the squadron it must be the
fault of the officers sole y if Tripoli is not completely humbled; &
even made to "pay tribute" to the U S should it be thought necessary

month has already passed away since we mentioned this business in
Washinoton) they can not be built in season to calculate on their
arrival gefore Tripoli at the time when it is contemplated to make
the attack, but if you allow him to buy the vessels I propose you will
be certain of having your object completely answered. Should you

my return I demanded his reason for so doing. - He answered
that the exhausted situation of the troops and people required a t
least one day's repose. 1 discovered however that his real Intention
was to remain on this ground until a courier should return, which
he was about to dispatch to Bomba in quest of our vessels. We had
only six days rations of rice; no bread nor meat and no small rations.
I ur ed this circumstance as an impulsive reason why the march
shoufd continue. - He said the Arab chiefs were resolved to proceed no further till the camp shall have recruited themselves by a
little repose. I told him if they preferred famine to fatigue they
might have the choice; and ordered their ration stopped. The day
passed confusedly among them.

At 3 p.m. the Bashaw, compelled by his Arab host, struck his
tent ordered his baggage packed, mounted, and took up a march for
Fiaume by the mountain. - I waited without emotion the result
of this movement; not chusing to betray a concern for ourselves. Discovering however an intention in the Arabs to sieze our provisions, I beat to arms. - My Christians formed a line in front of
the Magazine tent. Each party held an opposite position the space
of an hour. The Bashaw prevailed on the Arabs to return; they
dismounted; and he pitched his tent. Supposing the tumult tranquilized, I ordered the troops to pass the manual exercise, according
to our daily practice. I n an instant the Arabs took an alarm: remounted, - and exclaimed, "The Christians are preparing to f i e
on us!" The Bashaw mounted and put himself at their head, apparently impressed with the same apprehension. A body of about two
hundred advanced in full charge upon our people, who stood their
ground motionless. The enemy withdrew a t a small distance, singled out the officers,
Some of the Bashaw's offiand, with deliberate aim, cried -$re!
cers, exclaimed "For God's sake do not fire! The Christians are our
friends". Mr O'Bannon, Mr Peck and young Farquhar stood firmly
by me. Selim Aga (Caps of Cannoniers) his lieutenants and the two
greek officers remained stedfast a t their posts. - The others were
agitated, and in fact abandoned us. I advanced towards the Bashaw
and cautioned him against giving countenance to a desperate act.
At onco a column of muskets were aimed at my breast. - The
Bashaw was distracted. A universal clamor drowned my voice. I waved my hand as a signal for attention. ,4t this critical moment
some of the Bashaw's officers and sundry Arab chiefs rode between
us with drawn sabres and repelled the mutineers. - I reproached
the Bashaw for his rashness or rather weakness. His Casnadar
asked him if he was in his senses. - The Bashaw struck him with
his naked sabre. The fracas had nearly resumed its rage, when I
took the Bashaw by the arm; led him from the croud, and asked him
if he knew his own interests and his friends? He relented: - called
me his friend & protector: - said he was too soon heated: - and
followed me to my tent, giving orders at the same time to his Arabs
to disperse. After a moment's breath, he said if I would give orders
to issue rice it would quiet every thing. This I would do on no
other condition than his promise to march tomorrow morning a t
reveillee beating. - He promised, and provisions were issued. Confessions of obligation and professions of attachment were repeated
as usual on the part of the Bashaw and his officers; - and the camp
again resumed its tranquility. The fkm and decided conduct of
Mr O'Bannon, as on all other occasions, did much to deter the violence
of the savages by whom we were surrounded, as well as to support
our own dignity of character. After the affair was over the Bashaw
embraced him with an enthusiasm of respect, calling him The Brave
American. The Chevalier Davico, my Aid de camp, acted a part
which I would rather attribute to an amiable disposition than to
weakness of nerve. My Doctor behaved decidedly like a coward,
and a base one. Mr Farquhar conducted with manly firmness. One
of the Arabs, during the agitation, snapped a pistol at his breast.
Happily it missed h e : - had it been otherwise the fire would most

BOSTON
April Qth 1805
SIR I find all the ship yards in this place, and a t Salem occupied,
and the Carpenters generally engaged; it is therefore my opinion,
that I shall not be able to have the Bomb Vessels built in season to
reach the Squadron in the Mediterranean, before the last of August.
Mr Crowninshield, agrees with me in this point.
I beg leave to suggest an opinion, that two sloops or schooners of
about 80 or 90 Tons, may be purchased here; and by double planking,
and securely bolting, be rendered suiEciently strong for the resistance required in the use of 13 Inch Mortars: they may be got ready
to sail in a month from the time I receive your orders, if you should
approve the plan. They should be Ketch ngged - will be able to go
out, and return a t any season, and will transport all the military stores
for their use, with six months provison for the crew. They will cost
about four, or five thousand dollars, exclusive of the additional expence
of strengthening. Most of the articles for that purpose, I presume
can be procured a t the Navg Yard if you think proper. I should
advise not to copper them.
I shall leave this for Portland on thursday morning, and shall contract at Newbury Port, Portsmouth, or Portland for the building of
the two Bomb Vessels, and two Gun Boats, and transmit drawings
of the same, as soon as the contracts are made.
Should you adopt the plan of purchasing the two sloops or schooners,
as temporary Bomb Vessels to reach the Squadron in time for the
operations of this year, the Mortars coming round from Kew York,
can be taken for them, and two others of Brass can be cast here for
the use of the Bomb Vessels to be built b me.
Should you wish to send out immediate p more Gun Boats than are
built, I should recommend the purchase of some of the small North
River coasters a t New York, and some of the Hingham Packets a t
this place; they will answer extremely well for that purpose, and will
not I believe cost more than 2500 Dollars compleated for Sea, exclusive of their Military Stores. I believe three or four might be fitted
from here, in three weeks; but it would be necessa t,o send the Guns
(32 pounders) and shot &c"rom Washington or ew Pork.
PS. I shall return to this place by the time a n answer can arrive
from you.

you On the 6tP the weather being good, sent a Boat on shore with
Orders to use every means possible to hear from you, or find out
whether you had passed on your way to Derne, in the Evening the
Officer returned without being able to learn any thin - they could
not find a single Arab, or the appearance of there aving been any
there lately, except a t one place, about eight miles in the Country,
where there had been an encampment some time past, I had some
hope of its being your route, but from his discription, I found the tracks
too few for the number of men I suppose you must have with you,
there being no hopes of finding you at Bomba, I sailed next morning
to try if possible to find the Port of Trabucha, but meeting some difficulty in finding it I determined to try to send a Boat on shore at Cape
Razatin, On the 9th in the morning sent a Boat on shore at Cape
Razatin, the OBicer soon returned with an Arab, who informed me
that you had arrived in the neighbourhood of Trabca, and that an express had come from you to Derne, As this mans information appeared correct I determined to send him off express to you, which he
very readily consented to, but wished first to see his family, I sent
him on shore immediately to make his visit and return as soon as
possible, soon after the Boat landed, three men came down on Horse
back, who said they had orders from Hamet Bashaw to furnish us
with Beef &g if we came on this Coast, but I took them to be spies
sent from the Bey of Derne to see what we were about in this Bay,
after a little conversation with the Servant of the Minister, they rode
off sayin they would see us tomorrow. At sundown the Arab came
ofT and f l e f t the Cape for Bomba - should the Arab h d you, I
hope you will loose no time in inform. me of your situation, and
what time you will be at Bonrbay, tha?fmay meet you, as I do not
think the Bay safe to lay at Anchor in long, for fear of Gales Wind,
I shall stand out to sea, and call in every two or three days, and see
if you are there - when you arrive on the Coast, it will be well for
ou t o make fires, or some Signal that we may find you, the place of
Lnding a t Bornba is quite a t the Bottom of the Bay, a long distance
from where we lay Anchor, so that if some Signal is not made we shall
h d difficulty in finding you, I have a Sloop loaded with Bread,
flour, Rice &P and tl sum of money on board the Argus at your disposal,
the Frigate Congress is hourly expected on the Coast with the field
Pieces, so that I have no doubt but you will soon be in possession of
Derne - I have Letters for ou, which I hope to have the pleasure
of delivering you soon at Bom a. - Should you send the Arab back
with letters, I wish you to direct him to come to the bottom of the
Bay of Bomba, and should the Argus not be there, to remain until
she comes, as he will be sure of seeing us very soon, and you will please
follow the same steps should you arrive there yourself. - As I hope
soon to have the pleasure of seeing you, I shall say nothing of our

April loth 1806
SIR Previous to my leaving Malta, I heard Sir Alexander Ball
the Governor express a desire to obtain a couple of Fishing-smacks
or well Boats from this Country. The friendly attentions of that
gentleman to the Squadron I have the honor to command, induces
me to wish he may receive them a t the original cost here; this can be
done if you should think proper to order them to be purchased and
sent out loaded with Provisions and Stores for the Squadron. They
can be navigated by young Masters of Merchant Vessels, and Men
shipped, to be turned over to our Men of War on that station. The
Masters can serve as Mates on board the Gun Boats, or some other
TTesselsof the Squadron for the season, and return home in whatever
vessels may return in the Autumn. Thus shall we be able to oblige
the Governor (to whom we are under obligations) and supply our
Squadron with a quantity of Provisions, stores, and men free of
expence. Should this meet your approbation, I can procure two that
will answer the purpose, and do credit to the Carpenter's work of
this Country for about fifteen hundred Dollars each and the earlier
the Agent here has directions to pap for such as may be selected,
the greater will be the facility in sending them out.
P. S. The amount of the two Vessels being paid to the Agent a t
Malta or the Commander of the Squadron will be a remittance which
will save the difference of Exchange between Cash and Bills.

Seldom declines confirming such appointments Prom this View of the subject you will perceive Sir that although
Mr Laws is young on the roll of midshipmen, yet by very distinguished
conduct he might be preferred to a Lieutenancy before any of them

My intention was to have recoinoitered Luza & Cape Bon but
the appearance of many Vessels about Linosa & Lampedusa deprived
me of that Satisfaction; all of which proved to be from different
parts of Barbary & Constantinople; the last of them forc'd me to
chace, within forty miles of this Island which circumstance aided by
unsettled Weather, short allowance of Water & an idea that you
were anxious to hear from me, are causes of my returning so soon;
In addition to Captn Rodgers information, I beg leave to remark,
that the Bashaw has two Vessels on the Stocks, one rigged a Ketch,
the other appears to be intended for a Gun Boat, Likewise by a
Vessel that left Tunis on Sunday Morn, I learn that a Tripolitan
Corsair was in that road, the same that was there when the Nautilus
left it; - Our Crew thank God, have recovered from the small Pox,
with the loss of one Man only; yet still require a few days Attendance,
and care; - The Consiellation makes much Water in bad Weather;
the Brass Pipe in her side is very troublesome, & in bIowing weather
she malres so much water about the Bows and very low down, which

insinuated into the mind of the Bashaw that we aim only to use him
for the purpose of obtaining a peace with his brother, and that the
manner is indifferent with us. He gives place to this apprehension
because He has twice been deceived by C h r i ~ t i a npowers; and because
the English have deceived El$ Bey, as he says. - And he permits
himself so far to be carried away by the phantom as to fear least we
should give him up to the enemy. 3 oclock p.m. A general councel of war. - An insurmountable
reluctance on the part of the Arabs and some of the Bashaw's people
to proceed further without intelligence of our vessels induced me
to agree to halt and wait for intelligence after two d q s more march
in front. The Bashaw fears desertions in case of approaching Derne
without provisions. We have only three days half rations of rice
and no other supplies whatever: - and, what renders our situation
truly alarming, we can get no information of any ressels having
appeared off the coast; as we now plainly percieve their arrival alone
will prevent a revolt among our Arabs, who will undoubtedly take
any side which will give them the best fare. 7 o'clock. p.m. An officer came to my tent and informed me that
a mutiny was organized in the company of canoniers, & that they
were about to i m b ~ d yand demand their full ration of provisions
before this tent. - I told him to endeavor by geatle means to
suppress the mutiny; - and, if he found this method impossible, to
caution them on paln of death, not to appear in arms to make any
remonstrances with me. ,4t the same time sent for the issuing cornmissary to be informed of the exact quantity of rice on hand. - 1

SIR Since I wrote you last I have been honored with your Letters

of the 5th and gt@Inst. We have received from Philadelphia 14 Men in addition to those
that we received on the 4 t b and also received 130 Barrels of Beef 506
Barrl"read
and 1000 Twenty four Pound Shot by the Sloop President from Washington; Mf Beakman also informed me this Day that
the Pork had arrived and should be sent alongside immediately.
We progress slowly in recruiting; Good Seamen are difficult to procure and even when entered they give us much trouble in getting and
securing them on board.
There has joined the Ship within these few Days Lieut Marsline,
Messr"earney
Iceene and Chauncey Midshipmen and Doc: M'Allister as Surgeon's Mate; there has no Carpenter as yet arrived to
join the Ship; we are much in T a n t of one to take Charge of and
receipt for Stores in that Department.
Commodore Preble told me verbally that I might Order the Turkish Prisoners now on board of the John Adams some Cloaths (15-hich
they stand much in need of) but having received no Instructions
from you on that Subject I am at a Loss how to act, and shall wait
your Orders

I have rec* your letter of the 2nd instant. Fix the Rudder as you please but be careful that you don't fix it
so as to unship too easily. If the guriboat should ever touch, the

effect of dropping the Rudder 2 feet below the Keel, inevitably must
be, that it will be unshipped and probably materially injured. It
may possibly answer a good purpose while you are crossing the Ocean
to fix the Rudder as you propose, but it would not answer before
Tripoli. You probably can have it b e d so as to admit of its being
raised or lowered at pleasure.

every other? Let double - or if possible quadru le the number of

DEARSIR, I enclose you an extract of a letter which I have this
day received from Sidi hlehomet Dhguis Minister of Foreign Affairs
to His Excellency the Bashaw of Tripoli.
Extract
"The Bashaw is informed by a Courier that arrived yesterday from Tunis,
"that his brother Sidi Hamed is with the American Squadron, in come"quence thereof, he hns manifested his particular resentment"
"The Bashaw his said, that as long as the war was a war between America
"and him, it was a war of interest, that easily might be brought to a con"clusion by a lesser or greater sacrifice upon one side or the other, but now
"it was a war directed against his personal safety, the view of which was
"his dethronation. He wg therefore act in a manner that the feelines of
"the U. States shi be hurt in the most tender part, it was in his pow& to
"hurt them (meaning the prisoners)"
"The Minister desires you to mention these things t o the Commodore,
"and particularly t o represent to him the difficulties which attend any
"negociations when Sidi Hammed is interested." -

The foregoing, Dear Sir, is an exact extract, and it is unnecessary
for one to make any remarks, as your own mind u-ill make every
reflection which it vv$ be proper for me to suggest.
If you sh'J answer the letters which you will receive from hence on
a certain subject, I wish you not to mention the subject on which they

The Bashaw received an unfavourable letter from his agent at
Malta, concerning the armament of the Americans. The Spanish consul presented the Bashaw three hundred stand of arms and a number
of pistols, and, it is said, advised him to keep up the war, and force
the Americans to pay his demand. I t was wncluded that the Bashaw's
women and children should stay at the castle during the summer.
They said that if they must be taken, they would rather fall into the
hands of the Smericans than the Arabs.

U. S. Navy

SIR From the information received this evening from C a p t W e n t
that you are only waitin for a demand from the Neapolitan government for me and then d l give me up is the cause of my now writing
you.
Had I supposed that the business would have been carried so far I
should not have hesitated in giving myself up but thought I would
wait your opinion on my arrival at Syracuse from Messina relying on
your judgment and not wishing to be too premature if you had then
told me the propriety of giving myself up I certainly should have
done it but on the contrary your not thinking it proper at that time
led me to suppose that by my returning to America the thing would
have been entirely hushed up As the business has gone so far as to
place you in disagreable circumstances I am very willing to
myself up for trial at Messina, (provided you think proper) fee ing
perfectly conscious that I never committed a Crime in my life that
could cause me the least uneasiness that I am innocent of the death of
that man I am convinced within myself and hope to be able to conperson so, but allowing that I was the cause, from having
vince gent emen to dine with me I drank too freely of wines and corsome
dials as to make me in an entire state of iniebriety And never did I
know that I had injured the man in the least until1 I was informed
his informing me that the man was
of it next morning by Capt-ent
stabbed by an American officer. Mr Reed and myself being together
that ni ht on shore and his not having side arms with him made me
conclu e if he was injured by one of us it must been me. I be leave
to mention to you that spirituous liquors I scarcely ever drin& have
been intoxicated but seldom during my life and then being in a party
of young men where I was necessitated
Mr Reed who was with me all the evening, and was with me when
the accident happened did not himself know I had injured him, untill
he was informed of it the next morning and he says he recollects
every thing that took place that evening
As for myself I feel not the least fear from any punishment they
they can i d i c t my Conscience being perfectly easy that I am innocent
of any thing criminal. but my Mother My Brothers and Sisters and
my relations in general tis for them I feel knowing what great distress
it will cause them when they hear what has happened me, but Sir

as the business has gone so far I am ve willing to come forward for
trial to re-establish my character (as am now convinced that i t
must be injured from the cause of my accusation) and hope Sir you
will make use of every influence in your power in my behalf.
When I saw the man that evening he was surrounded by ten or
twelve Men two of whom had him by the Collar and seeing him in s
mob and hearing him speak English led me to suppose (as I remarked to
Mr Reed) that he either was an American or an Englishman in a
s c d e with those Sicilians and went up for the purpose of rescuing
him which I did and then let him go after talking with the man at
least ten minutes arid so far from supposing that I injured him thought
on the contrary I had been of service to him in getting h m out of
the hands of those fellows but next morning was informed the man
was dead and those very fellows who I drove from him had taken their
oaths that I killed him.
I have stated to you Sir every thing that happened and wait
entirely your commands

that the impracticability of approaching the shore with heavy ships

meet with little difficulty in establishing an intercourse - He has on

scattered throuhout all the plains in search of roots and vegitable
substances to appease the cravings of hunger. - A species of wild
fennel and sorrel which we found in the small ravines contributed
something to our support - At four oclock p. m. we reached
Bomba. - Rut what u-as my astonishment to find at this celebrated
port not the foot trace of a human being, nor a drop of water. And what my mortification to find no ~esselshere. - We had this
day taken up three Arabs who gave me positive declarations that
they had seen two vessels in the Bay a few days before, and very
well described the brig Argus, C a p t H H I ; but they were gone, and
I concluded had left the coast in despair of our arrival. - Nothing
could prevail on our Arabs to believe that any had been there. They
abused us as imposters and infidels; - and said we had drawn them
into that situation with treacherous views. - A11 began now to
think of the means of individual safety: - and the Srabs came to a
resolution to separate from us the next morning. - I recommended
an attempt to get into Derne. - This was thought impractible.
I went oft'with my Christians and kept up fires upon a high mountain
in our rear all night. - At eight the next morning, a t the instant
when our camp was about breaking up, the Bashaw's casnadar,
Zaid, who had ascended the mountain for a last look out, discovered
a sad! It was the Argus. - Captain Hull had seen our smokes,
and stood in. - Language is too poor to paint the joy and exultation which this messenger of life excited in every breast. - I
went on board at twelve oclock; - the camp in the mean time
moved five or six miles round the bay to a cistern of water, and at
six in the afternoon provisions were sent off to them. I remained
.on board all night.
On the l Y t h eleven in the morning the sloop Hornet arrived, laden
with provisions. - The quarter of the bay where the vessels fell in
with us being inconvenient for landing; - On the 1BtQ & lgth I

KAVD E P19
~ Apd 1805. I have received your Letter of the l o t h Ins; this day, stating that
Sir Alexander Ball had expressed to you a desire of obtaining 2 Fishing Smacks; and recommending the purchase of them, to be sent t o
hlaIta with provisions and there delivered to Sir Alex7 Ball a t the
ori,ginal Cost in this country. From your frequent communications to
me, Sir Alexr Ball has acted towards our Squadron in the most friendlv
manner and we have experienced from his friendship facilities which
have materially aided our operations against the Enemy. These
friendly attentions demand some return, and I cordinllv acquiesce in
pour proposal to make the purchase of 2 Fishing Smacks, to be sent
to Slr Alex' Ball. Purchase them therefore on the best terms in your power: appoint
to each vessel a Commander with the Rank & pay of a Sailing Master in
the Xavy ;appoint also another officer as Master's Mate, and empower
him to enter as many men as wi11 be sufficient to navigate the vessel
in safety. I have ordered Mids-lifton,
Blount, Ja? &M"Iauhon,
Turner MgGlauhon, and Carter, all from Iiorth Carolina, to report'
themselves t o you a t Boston. They are all inexperienced. You will
dispose of them either on board of the Fishing Smacks, or the Bomb
Vessels. The crews of the Smaclis may be entered to serve 2 years.
Able Seamen may be allowed $12 pr month - 4 months paid in advance upon good $ sufficient security to reimburse the government
in the event of desertion, 6t if they cannot be obtained without a
premium, you may allow to each able seaman (and I presume you
enter none but able Seamen) any sum as a premium not esceeding 20 Dry The Officers and Men are to be turned over to the Squadron after the Smacks shall be delivered up to Sir Alexander Ball.
I have this day sent to Samuel Brown esq' the sum of $3000 to pay
for the Smaclxs, & I have also sent llim the further sum of $2000 to
be advanced to the Seamen & Officers and to purchase pro~isions&$
for the voyage to Malta. He will apply the monies upon your
requisitions. When the Smacks shall be ready for sea, you will send them to Hartford Connecticut to receive their Cargoes of Daniel Olcott esqf giving them orders on M' Olcott for as much beef as they will carry:
their cargoes will consist entirely of beef. I shall m i t e to M r Olcott
directing the de1iyer-y of the Beef upon your orders. You rr-ill w ~ i t e
to me when the Smacks shall be ready to leave Boston. I shall send
their Sailing Instructions to meet them a t Hartford. Inform me of
the names of the persons you map appoint as the Commanders and
the names of the Smacks, and of all the arrangements you may make
in pursuance of these Instructions. [XDA. OST, Val. O, 1802-1805.1

Extract from journal of Surgeon Jonathan Cowdery, U. S. Navy, 19 April 1805

The Bashaw interrogated me concerning the force of my country;
he asked me how many marines the United States kept in pay. h/Iy
answer, for good reasons, was, ten thousand! How many troops?
he asked.- Eighty thousand, said I, are in readiness to march to
defend the country, at any moment; and one million of militia are
also reacty to fight for the liberty and rights of their countrymen!
At this, his highness assumed a very serious look, and I returned
to mv room.

DEPARTMENT
OF STATE

Aprl120tQI805
SIR,I have received your several letters of the 7t@May 16t!' July
and 3c NOT: last with their inclosures. Several points which they
present for consideration in relation to the routine of affairs at Algiers,
are passed over for the present as they are unconnected with the
Mission in which you are engaged, and may be conveniently taken
up hereafter.
Upon reviewing the instructions transmitted to you dated 6 t h June
last, nothing in the state and prospect of things which dictated them
appears to be changed by subsequent events; unless indeed the possibility of any considerable sacrifices being necessal-g should be considered as diminished by the spirited attacks made on the enemy
by Commodore Preble and the comparison which will naturally be
made of their effect with what may be expected from a repetition
of them when the season opens, with equal animation on a much
larger scale. Besides the force we have in the Mediterranean, the
President has directed the following reinforcements which will
appear at the rendezvous at or not long after your receipt of this
communication, viz
The frigate John Adams with 32 Guns (all on board but not
mounted) 600 men, Will sail early in may. Gun Boats No%. 3. 4.
5. 6 . 7. 8. 9. 10.
N9 2 will have 1. long 32 pound Cannon.

Thp Ceres, a p r o ~ s i o nship, has lately sai!ed from Baltimore with
provisions and military stores for the Squadron. The Ann another
provision ship is now on the eve of sailing from Baltimore. She also
has provisions and military stores on board for the squadron. A v e 5
sel from ll ~shingtonwill sail in all may, with spars, beef, Sread, powder &c &c for the squadron.
The difficulhes attending a manufacture so little practised in the
United States as that of large brass ordinance and other more pressing
engagements, in the public service, of the contractor, have hitherto
retarded the finishing of the guns for klgiers, but the delay itself will
ultimately prove beneficial; as it has affordedan opportunity of making such preparatory experiments as will enhance their q u a h t ~ I t
may also be stated, with strict truth, if an unpatience should be expressed a t their not arriving, that the ext'raordinary exertions of the
artists usually employed for such purposes, occasioned by dispatching
our naval force against Tripoli have not been the most inconsiderable
cause of the delay; whence the Dey may be led to feel a participation
in the inconvenience resulting from the obstinacy and injustice which
characterize the war as waged by the Bashax. The contractor however promises that without unforseen accidents, the Guns, shall be
finished in two months or at furthest in three.
Arrangements for repeating the Sally's cargo with the additions
intimated in my letter of the 6tQ of June were soon afterwards made
by the Kavy Department, but as the timber was not collected before
the frost set in, it could not be carried to the sea board until the spring.
I t is expected that it must be now ready for shipment, which will be
accelerated as much as possible.
The Bills you drew on the Navy Agents a t Leghorn negotiable a t
London were carried into the Market there and would have occasioned
a considerable loss, but for the judicious measure of purchasing them
on the public account adopted by Messr"AIonroe and Erving.
The hesitation you e-qressed whether the letter written by the Dey
of Algiers with a view to influence the Bashaw of Tripoli to accept
the terms of peace me maF offer should be used is justsed by important considerations. Our force in that sea being, we hope, adequate
to every necessary coercion, there is the less reason for contracting an
obligation of this sort to the Dey, who, as on former occasions, would
seek his reward in pecunimy demands. The interposition of Algiers
in procuring the original peace we made with Tripoli it is also understood was a secret motive with the latter for departin from it.
hfessrWathcart & OBrien have arrived with their amilies.

21" April 1806
SIR, From the most correct information I am able to obtain from
Derne, I am apprehensive we shall meet opposition st that place, a
rumour came to our camp yesterday with intelligence of a re-inforcement having arrived from Tripoli for the defence of that town and
Prorince, but did not state the exact Number, I had him under examination, from what I can learn from him, am persuaded this force does
not exceed five Hundred, to encounter it, we have great need of field
Artilery, besides the terror that Cannon impress on the undeciplined
Savages we have to dispute with, they will be our best resort against the
'CTalls of Derne, and surety in case of reverse - I t is unfavourable
to our expedition that the Congress has not arrived with artilery, if
you can spare from the Argus two of your 24lb Carronades with fixed
Amunition, and if we can find means of carrying them forward they
muy answer our purpose in advancing though they would be dead
weight in a retrogade movement, we have need also of four Barrels,
at least; of Musquet Powder, Balls & flints proportionate, and as
many h4usquets as can be spared, sufficient prorisions were landed
yesterday from the Hornet to carry us to Derne, for which Post we
shall move tomorrow if circumstances permit. - Should we advance
successfullv within attacking distance of the place, it is hoped you
will be able to bring the Guns of your detachment to hear on the
Enemjs Batteries; which being badly built; of bad materials, will not
be able tro resist you. - I have no reason to alter the opinion long

of Derne mill have, cons'der'd either as it respects our Military or
Political operations, and hitherto nothing has appeared to discourage
our calculations of success from the Co-opperation formed with Hamet
Bashaw, thus far I have found the Arabs attached to his interest,
because undoubtedy they find an interrst in that attachment notwithstanding their religious scruples and aversions, I find them like
the rest of mankind, moved by a present good, Cash will carry them,
with this the Gates of Tripoli may be opened, but we must use to the
best adrantage the means we have. - If in addition to the supplies of Provisions already received you can add the Arms & Amunition I now ask we will endeavour to seize the Post in view
I hope you will be as near us as the safety of your Vessels will
allow.
Of the effects I leave on board you, in case I see you no
more, I beg you will accept my cloak, and small sword, as marks of
my attachment, the Damascus, Sabre, which you will find in my chest,

Goods, and a number of Tripolitan Passengers, among them a Captain
of R Gun Boat belonging to Tripoli, the remainder Sons of the first

they aclinowledge both the Passengers and property were Tripolitan,
a part of which is said to be Powder, it remains a doubt with me whether
you consider this part of the Coast in a state of Blockade, as I have
not heard your opinion on the subject, if not I may have done wrong

DEARSIR I have this day been led into a secret which may be

to my last letter I had purchase a Tribarcola and was about to send
her from this place but some busy body, gave information to the Governor & the owner was instantly taken up 8t put in the castle & I

Frigate John Adams. She has on board a number of men which you
will distribute among the Vessels of the Squadron as may appear to
you the most expedient. She has also on board some Canvas and Shot.
We shall keep this Vessel plying between this country and the Mediterranean to furnish the Squadron in that sea with such succours of
provisions and Men as may from time to time be required. It is
therefore intended that she shall after delivering the men & q return
to the &Branch without delay. I deem it however, proper to invest
you with the power and you will consider yourself hereby invested
with the pourer of employing the John Adams in your operations against
the enemy should any special occasion or occasions arise which in
your opinion may render her services essentially necessary. But if
no such occasion should arise, you will order the John Adams immediately to the Eastern Branch directing that she shall touch on her
way out a t the principal ports in the Mediterranean frequented by
American Merchantmen to afford Convoy. I have ordered Cap: Stewart to proceed aloft with the Siren to
join the squadron. I give this order from the persuasion that there
can be no good reason assigned for keeping the Siren in the Neighbourhood of Morocco. Surely the Emperor of Morocco will not have
the temerity to attack our Commerce when we have such a powerful
force in the Mediterranean, and should he attempt such a proceeding
you can punish him effectually with the force committed to your
direction. The gun boats are now all under sailing orders excepting K Q 1 which as I have informed you by my letter of the 16th inst has been

will not forward it. You will consider my order to you of the 31
May 1804 directing the call of a Court of Enquiry upon the conduct of
Cap: Bainbridge as hereby revoked. I enclose 2 Commissions for Masters Commandant and a Commission for a Surgeon which you will deliver. 1also enclose 38 Commissions for Lieutenants to be delivered under the regulations prescribed in my letter to you of the 1 June 1804. [NDA. LB, 1799-1807.1

SIR I have to acknou~ledgethe recei t of your Several Letters of
the 1i t P of Febr, the 8", 119'%nd 30t@of &arch and 13Q' of the present
Month, together with their respective enclosures
Your drafts for two thousand dollars have been duly honored,
whch together with the bills remitted to you from this place, I find
has fully covered all your expenditures &:-up to the l o t $ of April,
according to your account and left a balance in your hands of
$627 52/100

I have not given tho usual formality of approbation to the last
account, as I wish to have some explanation of certain items before I
can feel myself justsed in gi~<nga full approbation - Viz! the
Charge of a loss of 116 doll? on a blll of P' 1101.9. of 8/m. under date
of Sept. 1gt@1804 - ditto of 20 doll' on a bill of 500 P' of 8/r on the

C 333.11.11. of 8/r on
7 Jan?' 1805 - ditto of 15 dol1"oss on the Exchange of Spanish
Dollars 13 te FebY 1805. - ditto of 308 dollars for barley and straw
for the public Horse and hlule, dated 28 Febr 1805 - and of the Necessity of a Second Drogerman whose wages are charged. - The amount
of repairs for the Consular House appears to me very high, particularly as the rent is certainly ver great. The charge for Stationary,
and several other items which I ave never charged myself in Algiers
to t-heGovernment of the United States, I forebear to comment upon;
because I do not wish to place any restrictions, where the same Charges
may have been allowed heretofore
I long since informed Capt? Bainbridge, and I think I must have
mentioned it in one of my letters to you; that the funds necessary for
the support of our unfortunate Countrymen in Tripoli would be
furnished by the Commoder of our Squadron in these Seas; and that.
I could only furnish them in Cases of emergencies; or when there
might not be an opportunity of his recelvlng them from that quarter. The ill Health of Commodore Barron, has I presume prevented his
having notsed the thing to Cap? B. and taking measures to have

which he has ately received, as well as other funds, besides t ose
furnished through you, will answer all their purposes for some time to
come; and in the mean time arrangements will be made to supply
them in future, if i t should be necessary from the proper source.
and I beg you will inform Captc B. of this. I cannot help expressing my surprize a t the loss on bills drawn by
you upon me a t this place, as the large Quantities of Wheat purchased here has caused a great demand of money from Tunis on
Malta, and I had reason to think there wd rather have been a premium than a discount on bills for this place.
I thank you for the information contained in your several Letters,
and am pleased to find that every thing relating to our affairs still
remains quiet with you. - If His Excellency the Bey of Tunis is
really disposed and determined to go to war with us he will not fail
to take occasion therefor from the conduct which our Squadron will
be obli ed to pursue during the Blockade of Tripoli; but I hope he
knows is own interest too well to attempt breaking with us while
we have such a force in his neighbourhood; for sltho' we should fear
the ultimate issue of a war with him, yet it would be a great deran ement of our Operations against Tripoli should he break out a t t is
moment.
The Ketch which was sent to tripoli with Clothing &$ for our
Countrymen there, returned this day. By her I have received letters from Captg Bainbridge, and from the French & Spanish Consuls.
The latter has written me by Order of His Excellency the Bashsw,
to state the grounds on which he is will5 to open a negotiation for
peace - Vizt 200,000 dolls for peace & Ransom, and the deliver?. of
all his Subjects in our possession, with their property. - These
terms are inadmissable, as we shall never pay a Cent for peace, and
if ransom should be paid it must only be for such a number of Bmericans as may exceed the ru'umber of Tripolines in our power. The
Consul, however, adds, that altho' these are stated by His Excellency the Bashaw as the Grounds for Negotiation, yet he is well
assured that there might be a Change. All our accounts from the
same quarter state also the strong desire for peace which prevails a t
Tripoli, so that 1 have good hopes that by the time we are ready to
commence our Operations the Bashaw may be brot to such terms
as we can with propriety agree to. - Altho' the operations by
Land I have always been opposed to them in the way they have
been undertaken, and believe that they will ultimately be productive
of no good to our Cause. - VJe are yet without any accounts from
hlr Eaton since he left E pt. The Commodore's h e a B is mending slowly; but I think there
is no prospect of his being able to take an active Part in any operations this Season. - The Physicians urge the necessity for a Change
of Climate as soon as possible.
I am glad to learn by my letters from Algiers that our affairs in
that quarter still stand well, and that the report of an Insurre[c]tion
&? was without foundation.
The particulars of the attack made on
the De you have undoubtedly received
Our $essels arc all absent from this port a t present; but we expect
the return of some very soon, when one will probably be sent to
Tunis, by which you will receive all the news from this Quarter, and

Necessity has compelled me to introduce this officer again in the Navy.
He holds his original Commission, though still his Rank in the Navy
is as yet undetermined. I n forming a determination upon this point,
numerous difficulties have presented themselves. I am told that he
is an excellent officer, and a gentleman of extensive experience in his
profession. These considerations dispose me to give him a higher
Rank than his late appointment in August last, but on the other hand
there is a number of young genblemen of very distinguished merit
who might feel themselves dishonored by Lieu! 'hfurdock's be
placed over them. Probably however when they become scquainte

polite attentions while at Malta.
The last letter with which you honored me previous to my leaving
the station was dated the 20tQSept 1804, in answer t o mine enclosing
you a copy of the official letter from my Government notifying me of
my superceedure in the Command of our Squadron; the two letters
I recg from you previous to that were marked Private, and considered
as such by me, but that of the lot@bein in answer t>oa communication of a public nature and not rnark'd $rim& I took the liberty to
permit a friend in our service to peruse, and by his earnest request, to
extract from it for the sattisfaction of a friend of his in Congress a
paragraph considered highly honorable to me, as it was expressive of
your approbation of my Conduct, I however enjoin'd i t upon him to
not allow it go any farther than I s friend, I was therefore astonished
on m arrival to find published in one of our News Papers something
like t e Paragraph in question altho not literally the same, it is true
that your Name is not mentiond as the writer, but in a Marginal note
you are supposed to have been, indeed your character is so deIineated
in the paragraph itself as to justify the supposition.
I am extremely sorry that an extract from any letter with ~c-hich
you hon* me, should have been published without your consent and
without my consent or knowledge, be assured it has given me much
uneasiness. I do not however consider that it can in any way be injurious to you, altho conjecture has made you the author, and shall be
extreme] grieved should it in any way interrupt the harmony and
good un erstanding heretofore subsisting between us.

DERNE28t+April 1805
SIR, I have the honor to inform you, that at 9 0-Clock in the
morning of the 27Q being about 10 Miles to the Eastward of the Town
of Derne, with the Hornet in Company, we discovered the NautiEu~
at Anchor very close to the shore, which led us to suppose that Cap'
Dent had fallen in with M' Eatons Army, as he had been sent in shore
for that purpose the day before. - We made all sail for the ~Vautilus,
and at 3 past 10 spoke her, and was informed by Cap! Dent that he
had, had communication with M' Eaton the night before, and that
he wished to have the field Pieces landed as soon as possible, and
that MI' Eaton intended to make an attack upon Derne as soon as
he could get possession of them, being then about two and a half
miles from the Town, and the Enemy having sent him a chdenge,
hoisted out our Boat to send the field Pieces on shore with such supplies as hfr Eaton was in want of, but on approaching the shore we
found that it was impossible to land the Guns without hauling them
up an almost perpendicular rock Twenty feet above the Boat. But
with the perseverence of the Officer and men sent on this service,
they effected the landing one of them, by hauling them up the steep
Rock. M': Eaton finding that we should loose time in landing the
other, sent it off again informing me that he should march for the
Town as soon as he could possibly mount the field Piece that he had
on shore. gave Lieutenant Evans Orders to stand close in shore, and
cover the Army while they were preparing to march, in case the
Enemy should come out against them, as they had already made
their appearance in large numbers outside of the Town, gave Orders
for the necessary preparations to be made for the attack by Sea upon
the Town and Batteries, and stood down very close to the Town. At 2 P. M. Mr Eaton began the attack by Land, a t same time the
Hornet Lieup Evans Anchored with Springs on his Cables, within
One hundred Yards of the Battery of eight Guns, and commenced a
heavy fire upon it,
The 2\'autilus took her station to the Eastward of the Hornet, a t
K a miles distance from shore, and opened upon the Town $ Battery
The Argus Anchored without, and a little to the Eastward of the
Nautilus, and began firing on the Town and Battery - The fort
kept up a heavy fire for about an hour, after w-hich the shot flying so
thick about them, they abandoned it, and run into the Town and
Gardens back - The Guns of the Vessels were turned on the Beach,
and kept a heavy fire upon the Enemy to clear the way for the few

548

hTATiAL OPERATIOOYSFROM 180-4 TO 1805

.

brave Christians M' Eaton had with him, to enter the fort as they
were gaining ground very fast though a heavy fire of hlusquetry
was constantly kept upon them from behind the Houses and old
Walls near the shore. At about a half past 3 we had the satisfaction
to see Lieu: O.Bannon, and Mr Mann Midshipman of the Argus,
with a few brave fellows with them, enter the fort, h a d down the
Enemys flag, and plant the American Ensign on the Walls of the
Battery, and on turning the Guns of the Battery upon the Town,
they found that thc Enemy bad left then1 in great haste, as they were
found primed and loaded at their hand. TThilst our men mere turning the Guns of the Battery upon the
Town, Hamet Bashaw had taken possission of the back part of it,
which brought the Enemy between two fires, which soon silenced
them, and about four in the Afternoon we had complete possession of
the Town and Fort, sent all our Boats on shore, for the purpose of
carrying Amunition to the Fort, and to bring off the wounded men,
as soon as possible, that they might be dressed. - Mr Eaton gave
the necessary Orders at the Fort, and went into the Town to see
every thing quiet, and to make arrangements for the Towns being
well guarded during the night. At a half past five, he returned 0x1
board to get his mound dressed, having received a hlusquet Ball thro'
his left wrist. - On collecting our men we found one killed and
Thirteen Wounded, a list of which I have the honor to send you.-

where the ancients had their theatres and ampitheatres. I here discovered the appearance of a great building, even some of their seats

for the Barbaq Regencies

DERNEApril 2929th 1805
SIR The information I have the honor to forward of this date,
stating in abstract occurrencies since my last, will not disappoint the
expectations my Calculations then may have formed.
Certain periods of your letter of 22"g TTlto. require a seperate and
distinct answer, This I shall do with candor.
It was understood when Governme[n]t same to a determination to
try the effect of a Co-operatmionwith Hamet Bashaw, against the Enemy, that provision would be made adequate to the experiment Six
field pieces, a thousand stand of Arms with suitable amunition and
Eighty thousand Dollars were asked for by Hrtmet Bashaw while yet
in possession of this province and gaining ground against the Wsurper - the Secretary of the Kavy inform'd me, that the Arms Amunition, & fifty Thousand Dollars would be furnish'd; and they were to
have been put on board at Hampton Roads. White the Squadron
were getting ready for sea, information arrived of the Bashaw having
been driven from his post and retired to Eygpt, I n consequence of
which it is to be presumed, the supplies getting in readiness were u-itlield as the success of the experiment then appeard very doubtfull.
The tu-enty thousand Dollars deposited u-ith the Consul General a t
Algiers, to be applied to this service, cannot be supposed adequate
to the purpose, of bringing the Bashaw- from his exile in Egypt, plating him in a situation to act against a rival possessed of all the resources
of his Kingdom, and of carrying his plan of opperations into Effect,
Whatever may have been the disposition of the people towards him,
the twenty thousand Dollars therefore could have been meant, only
to assist the research of the Bashaw, and the reviral of his affairs, in
case our plan should be thought feasible, Hence I think it is not presuming too far to conclude, that the unlimited discretion vested in
the Commander in Chief, in regard to all the exigencies of the IT-ar,
and particularly as it relates to the object in view, extends to every
matter necessary to its accomplishment. The instructions of the Secretary of the Navy, certainly cannot mean to tie him down to any
limited application, The advantages calculated to result from the
Success of this measure, have been heretofore stated; and thus far,
the experiment has not disappointed those calculations We are in
possession of the most raluable province of Tripoli The high estimation the enemy places on this department of the Kingdom is evidenced by the extraordinary efforts he has used to defend it, and by
the menaces to which he has resorted to deter us from the operations
here; his Camp was only fourteen hours march from the place when

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS

we seized it by assault. I am this evening inform'd they are retrograding, and only regret that we have not the means of pursuing them.
The expences already incurred in this expedition %dl amount to
nearly thirty thousand Dollars, for thirteen thousand of which we are
indebted to Mess'c Briggs, Brothers, of Alexandria, Eleven thousrtnd
have been received through the hands of Cap. Hull, including his advances and drafts in Egypt - I have disbursed nearly two thousand and
for the residue shall be indebted to individuals. This expence will not
appear extravagant, when i t is consider'd, that it covers all our expenditures in Egypt, where many sacrifices were necessary to pass the
barriers of Turkish jealousy, and avidity in getting the Bashaw through
that Country, of furnishing horses, tents, arms, and amunition, prepatory to our entering the desert - of provisioning a thousand two
hundred souls, and about two hundred horses, in that barren desert
upwards of forty Days, a distance of nearly five hundred miles, and
of Caritvans for transporting those provisions the whole distance from
Alexandria; and also the unavoidable expenditures in presents to
chiefs, and payments to troops in order to gain the one and avail
ourselves of the services of the other MAY lat

The situation in which i t is known Hamet Bashaw was found
in Upper Egypt must of itself suggest the idea, that he must be
destitute of all means of mooving a Military expedition except the
attachment of his subjects. The possession of this Province does not
materially alter that situation. The general failure of the Harvest,
which the whole coast of barbary experienced last Season, together
with the exbraordinary tributes which Jussuf Bashaw has exacted to
support the War, has render'd not only this, but every other part of
Tripoli, poor & oppress'd; wholly destitute of contributing any thing,
very considerable to either of the rival Brothers. This is acircumstance favorable to our measures, if we will go to the expence of
profiting of it - No Chief: whatever may be the attachment of his
followe~,
.can long support Military opperations, without t.he means
of subslsbing and paying his troops, The observation is peculiarly
applicable to the temper and Circumstances of the Arabs of this
Country, who in fact form, its real strength, who are poor, yet avaricious, and who being accustom'd to despotism, are generally !ndiiTerent about the name or person of their despot, provided he imposes
no new burthens, Stronger proof of this cannot be brought, than the
d a c u l t y Jusuf Bashaws Camp has found in recruiting in its progress
from Tripoli. it left there long since with about two hundred Men,
I have this morning intercepted six letters from that Camp, dated
only four days since, sign'd by the Commander in Chief, the Governor
of Bengazi, and an Aid de Camp address'd to the Governor of Derne,
& to several Chiefs or Shieks encouraging them to hope & perseverance & stating that their delay has only been occasioned by e-xpectations of receiving reinforcements from the Arab Tribes. They have
increased their number only three hundred 'bho they have pass'd
through that part of the Country nearest, and most nearly attached
to the Enemy. Hamet Bashaw brought two thousand Arabs into the
field on the 27@ This serves to shew the weight of money with these
eople, and as a pretty good criterion of the ballance of influence
getween the two Bashnws. With the aids contemplated by Govemment to have been furnished Harnet Bashaw, when in the possition

he now holds. I have no doubt, but he may proceed to the Walls of
Tripoli. But while I offer this Opinion, I cannot conceal my apprehensions, grounded on experience, that when arrived there he would
effect little, without more military talent $ firmness, than exists
either in himself or the hordes of Arabs who attach themselves to
him; They are exactly what Volney describes of the Camps of the
Egyptian Beys, rather a rabble than an Army, & in our affair here,
they held safe positions to catch fugitives, until1 the doors of the
Enemy were open'd for plunder, when they became a t once brave,
& impetuous. If therefore the co-operation is to be pursued wit,h him
and 'its direction is to be confided to me, it must be on condition that
detachments of regulars may be occasionally debark'd from the Squadron, or procured elsewhere, to aid and give effect to such operations
as require energy. With the supplies asked for, provisions for our
Christians, and with the firm front of our regular regiment, I belieye
it would not be presuming too far to engage, in conjunction with the
Squadron, to force the enemy to take refugue in a Sanctuary; But
I confess, Sir, there is one discouraging circumstance resulting fron
the declared views, in affording auxiliaries to Hamet Basliau-. These
aids are to withdrawn at any period, when the Enemy shall propose terms of peace, which may be accepted by the Agent of Government on the spot. If Hamet Bashaw is to be used solely as an
instniment, to the attainment of an Object, exclusively to the advantage of the United States, witbout any consideration to his future
emtence and well being. I cannot persuade myself that any bonds
of patriotism dictate to me the duty of having a Chief Agency, nor
indeed any, in so extraordina~a Sacrifice. Certainly the Enemy will
propose terms of Peace with us, the moment he entertains serious
apprehensions of his Brother. This may happen a t any stage of the
War, most likely to rid him of so dangerous a rival, and not only only
Hamet Basbaw, but every one acting with him, must inevitably fall
victims to our economy, If we proceed no farther, it wou'd seem
incumbent on the honor of Government in the event of Peace, at,
least to place Hamet Bashan-, in a situation as ellegible as that from
which he has been drawn; out of the power of an ineens'd and vindictive enemy - Probably Jusuf Bashaw would agree to establish him
in the Government of this province and Bengaza, and to restore to him
his family He may perhaps be made satisfied with such an Accomodation, & the United States experience from it, many of the advantages calculated to result from carrying the original plan into execution, and consistently with both our honor and interest, At all events
I am deeply impress'd with the opinion, that the post we have secured
here, should not be abandoned, nor terms of peace precipitately embraced; Indeed it were to be wished that the effect of the success of
Co-operation might be tried - I t would very probably be a death
blow to the Barbarg System. Any accomodation savoring of relaxness would as probably be death to the Navy, and a wound to the
National honor. If it is determined to proceed, or hold a position
here, further supplies of cash & provisions, must immediately be sent
to the Coast, for reasons which will suggest themselves, from preceeding observations, I t would not be good polic in Hamet Bashaw,
to levy Contributions during the Contest with $is brother, least it
should alineate his friends. On the contrary, he ought to be enabled
to move with a liberal hand. Cash will do much with the inhabitants

of this Country; even those whom it will not engage to fight, will by
it be engaged not to fight: With it we can pass generally. But if we
here & there find a waU1d town, or a garrison.impert-ious to its influence, cannon balls 8: bayonets come in as irresistable Agents.
The Convention I have enterld into with Hamet Bashaw, may be
usefull, in case he succeeds in getting repossession of his Government;
otherwise it can do no mischief, eTen if ratified, as will appear, by the
precaution in the second article. 1 enclose a copy
It is with much pain I keep a sedentary position to write, this
circumstance with the indulgence I allow myself to expect from your
goodness, will I am persuaded; furnish me an apology for omissions
and inacuracies

whom I have consulted, and m;).self, that the Argus & L!VautiEusshould
remain here, untiIl these dispatches can receive answers, on account of
the Enemy's Camp being in the Vicinity - I am confident it will
not approach us, but disperse if it bas not already, Should it perceived howe~er,that the coast is to be abandon'd, it would encourage
an effort in the Commanders to gain their post of destination
I have not language to express my sense of gratitude and obligation,

SIR Oweing to impediments too tedious to detail, but chiefly to
delinquency in our Quarter Masters department, which I had confided
to Richard Farquhar. I did not l e a ~ eAlexandria, 'till the third of
last Month - The host of Arabs w-ho accompanied the Bashaw from
that place, and joined him on the rout, mooring chiefly with their
families & flocks, render'd our progress through the desert slow &
painfull, add to this the ungovernable temper of this maurauding
Malitia, and the frequent fits of despondency, amounting sometimes
to mutiny, occasion'd by information almost erery day meeting us
of formidable re-enforcements from the Enemy, for the defence of this
place, and it will not seem unaccountable, that it was not 'till the
fifteenth instant we arrived a t Bomba, TTe had now been twenty f i ~ e
days without meat, and fifteen without bread, subsisting on Rice Happily the next morning, discover'd the Argus, to urhom I made
Signals by Smoke,which were disco~erdand answered - The Hornet
soon after appeared, Cap. Hull sent off a Boat. I went on board, &
had the honor and inexpressible satisfaction of receiving your communications of 22Â°C L?to.- The timely supplies that came forward in
these Vessels gave animation to our half famished people; and no time
was lost in moving forward on the morning of the 25th We took post
on an emminence in the rear of Derne, Several chiefs came o u t to meet
the Bashaw with assurances of fealty and attachment; By them I
learn'd, that the City was divided into three departments, two of
which were in the interest of the Basbaw and one in opposition

-

554

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1804 TO 1805

This department 'tho fewest in numbers, was strongest in position &
resources, being defended by a Battery of eight guns - the blind
walls of the houses, which are provided in all directions with loop holes
for Musketry, and b temporary parapets thrown up in several
positions, not covered
the Battery, this department is nearest the
Sea and the residence of the Bey.
On the morning of the 26th terms of Amity were offered the Bey on
condition of allegiance and fidelity, The flag of Truce was sent back to
me with this laconic answer "my head or yours!" At 2 P M discover'd
the Nautilus & spoke her at six, in the morning of the 27tWhe Argus
& Hornet appear'd & stood in. I immediately put the Army in motion
and advanced towards the City, A favorable land breeze enabled the
Nautilus & Hornet, to approach the shore, which is a steep & rugged
declivity of rocks With much d%culty we landed and drew up the
precipice one of the field pieces, both were sent in the boat for the
purpose, but the apprehension of loosing this favorable moment of
attack, induced me to leave one on board. We advanced to our
position, Lieu: Evans stood in and anchoring within one hundred
yards of the battery, opened a well directed fire Lieu$Dent dropped in
and anchor'd in a position to bring his guns to bear upon the Battery
& City, Cap. Commandant Hull brought the Argus to anchor a little
South of the Nautilus so near as to throw her 24 PC Shot quite into the
Town - A detachment of six American Marines, a company of 24
Cannoniers and another of 26 Greeks including their proper Officers,
all under the immediate Command of Lieu! OBannon, together with
a few Arabs on foot, had a position on an emrninence opposite to rt
considerable party of the enemy, who had taken post behind their
temporary parapets and in a ravine a t the S E quarter of the town The Bashaw seized an old Castle which overlook'd the town on the
S. S. W. disposing his Cavalry on the plains in the rear, A little before
2 P M the fire became General in all quarters where Tripolitans and
Americans were opposed to each other, In three quarters of an hour
the Battery was silenced but not abandoned, 'tho most of the enemy
withdrew precipitately from that quarter, and join'd the party opposed
to the handful of Christians with me, which ap eared our most vulnerable point, Unfortunately the fire of our fie d piece was relaxed,
by the rammer being shot away
The fire of the enemy's Musketry became to warm, and continually
augmenting, Our troops were thrown into confusion, and undiciplined as they were, it was impossible to reduce them to order, I
perceived a charge - our dernier and only resort, We rushed forward
against a host of Savages, more than ten to our one. They fled from
their Coverts, irregularly, firing in retreat from every Palm tree, and
partition wall in their way, At this moment I recd a Ball through my
left wrist, which deprived me of the use of the hand and of course of
my Rifle, - Mr OBannon, accompanied by M' Mann of Annopolis
urged forward with his Marines, Greeks, and such of the cannoniers
as were not necessary to the management of the field Piece, pass'd
through a shower of Musketry from the Walls of houses, took possession of the Battery, planted the American Flag upon 'its ramparts,
and turn'd 'its guns upon the Enemy, who being now driven from
their Out Posts fired only from their houses, from which they were
soon dislodged by the whole fire of the Vessels, which was suspended
during the charge being directed into them, the [Hamet] Bashaw soon

gY

-

got possession of the Bey's Pallace; his Cavalry flank'd the flying
enemy, and a little after four OClock, we had compleat possession
of the Town The Action lasted about two hours & a half The Bey
took refuge, first in a Mosque & then in a Hiram the most sacred of
Sanctuaries, among the Turks, and is still there, But we shall find
means to draw him thence - As he is the third man in Rank in the
Kingdom, he may perhaps be used in exchange for Captain Bainbridge. I have fixed my post in the Battery, raised parapets and mounted
Guns towards the Country, to be prepar'd against all events, 'tho I
have no serious apprehensions of a Counter revolution, The moment
of gaining Derne has been peculiarly fortunate, as the Camp, which
long since left Tripolifor 'its defence were within two days, fourteen
hours march, the day of our Attack; of which we had information in
the morning and from which circumstance, it was with much dSculty
I could prevail on the Bashaws Army to advance to the City, & to
obey my dispositions - The Camp will probably take up a retrograde march Of the few Christians who fought on shore I lost fourteen Killed and
Wounded, three of whom are Marines, one dead and another dying,
the rest chiefly Greeks, who, in this little affair well supported their
ancient character
I t would be going out of my sphere to comment on the conduct of
Naval Commanders, yet I should do violence to my own sense of duty
& obligations were I not to observe, they coul'd not have taken better
positions for their Vessels nor managed their fire with more skill and
advantage.
The detail I have given of M' OBannons conduct, needs no enconiurn,
and it is believed the disposition our Government has always discover'd
to encourage merit, will be extended to this intrepid, judicious and
enterprising Officer M' Manns conduct is equally meritorius.
I am bound also by a sense of well merited esteem, to mention to
your particular patronage, a young English GentIeman, Mr. Farquhar,
who has Volunteer'd in our expedition through the desert, and has
in all cases of diÂ£Eculty, exhibited a firmness and attachment, well
deserving my Gratitude, If compatible with our Establishments, I
request you will ensure him a Lieutenancy in the Marine Corps

SIR, From the best information I can gain since having possession
of this place, I find that the former Bey of Derne, has yet a party in
the Town of about one third of the inhabitants, many of which, are
men of influence, which makes it necessary to keep a good look out for
them - Consequently have thought proper to detain the Nautilus
a few days lon er, and send the Hornet into Port, her Guns being disabled by the P ank Shears giving way, and being aware of your intention of fitting her for a Bomb Vessel this Summer, lead me to believe
that you are anxious for her arrival, to commence her repairs. - Cap$

MALTAApril SOt@ 1805
MY DEAR SIR I have now before me your several letters of the
24th of October and 16 of December 1804, and of the l l t @
of Feb?
and 15th & 23d of March, and assure you that I feel the highest
satisfaction at the full information contained in them
My absence from Algiers has been very far beyond any thing I
could have calculated upon when I left that place, and not a single
direct opportunity of writing to you has offered untill the present. I am much pleased to find the Continuance of a good disposition
towards the U. S. in the Dey and Govt of Algiers I was fully impressed
with the good grounds on which we stood when I left that place,
and had the best Confidence in a Continuance of their friendship;
in which I am happy in not finding myself disappointed. - The
Expressions of regard and friendship expressed by His Excellency
and the Great Officers, must be reciprocated with Cordiality - The
Conduct of Segnor Juan has surprized me and mortified me hluch,
as I had conceived u high opinion of his correctness of conduct and
beleived that the treatment which he had experienced from me would
have restrained him from doing any thing which might be likely to
bring me into difficulty. - The attachment of the Drogerman &
Sidi Alli, and their attentive Conduct will not be fergotten on my
return; and those of the Servants who Continue to behave well will
find their reward. - I am pleased to learn that B & B [Bacri and
Rusnah?], continue their attentions, and I am fully convinced they
will find it their interest to pursue the same line of conduct. The
arrival of the Regalia Ship, William & Mary, must shew the Dey
that we are attentive to our engagements; altho the Cargo was not
exactly such as might have been wanting. - Your answe1 to the
request for building a 74 Gun Ship was highl? prudent and proper. I approve very much of your conduct towards Capt? Keets and those
with him, when they came to settle their affairs with the Regency. I have received a letter from Lord Nelson expressive of his sense
of such Conduct, and his particular thanks ttoyou. - I shall enclose

558

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1804 TO 1805

you a Certificate to act as a Charge d'Affaires of the U. S. during my
absence, and send the Consular Seal, in the fullest confidence, of the
Prudence and propriety of your Conduct during my absence. - I
am exceedingly sorry that any disagreement has taken Place between
yourself and the Sweedish Consul; but shall forbear any animadversion
on the subject untill I have the pleasure of seeing you. - You will
be pleased to make my best respects and Congratulations to His
Excellency the Dey on his escape from the late outrageous and
wicked attack made on him. Tell him I pray God to preserve him
many years. - Having now adverted to the several subjects mentioned in your letters, I have to inform you that you receive this
letter by the Imperial Polacre ship Premura, Capt? Bartolomew
Smucheriech, which I have chartered and loaded with Wheat for
Algiers, as you will see by the enclosed, Charter Party, Invoice and
Bills of Lading. - There are on board this Ship fourteen hundred
salms of wheat, each Salm making eight bushels & more of English
measure; besides two Bales of Mocho coffee of 300 and odd pounds
english each and 3 barrels of loaf Sugar, Containing 500 IbF together &
50 stone flower pots with some other small articles which will be
mentioned in the Poscript of this letter or in another.
I have made this Shipment in consequence of your advice in your
letter of the 15th of March, that wheat was @ 6 dollars per measure,
in Order to place a sum of Money in Algiers, on account of the United
States, to pay our annuity in Cash, if it can be done, up to the 25*
of March 1805, which was the day on which our annuity became due
from our last settlement. - The advantages of making a payment
in Cash are to obvious to need a comment, and altho' our annuity
by Treaty is Stated at 21,600 dollars or 12,000 Sequins et by sending
stores it amounts to more than double that Sum; anc r if we can by
paying 30,000 dollars in cash, settle an Annuity we must be great
gainers. - This Cargo Costs here upwards of 34 dollars, with
Charges; as you will see by the Invoice &p - The Scudo of Malta
being 21 - and the dollar 5,' - You will have enclosed a letter to
Messr@Bacri & Busnach consigning this Cargo at least the Wheat, to
them, if they should stand on the high ground which I presume they
do from your letters, and from the Situation in which I left them. The Sugar & Coffee, together with that sent from Gibraltar, will put
a large [supply?]in your hands. Some of it must be used occasionally
to keep up a good understanding with certain persons, and I trust
to your Prudence and good judgement to have such distributions as
are necessary made with Proper economy, at the same time that they
ma be Serviceable to our Country.
l s this Cargo is very valuable I have judged it proper to send a
Supercargo with it, to attend to the delivery, the same person who
has seen it put on board. His Name is Luigi Paduani and is reccomended to me by M: Higgens (who you will see has procured and
ships the Cargo for me) as a very honest, sober, and intelligent man.
You will see by a translation of the agreement with him, enclosed,
that he will live at my house untill an opportv may offer for him to
return to this place, and I hope you will find him an agreeable inmate. I have a double view in sending this Cargo of Wheat to Algiers,
The first is to place money there to pay an annuity, if it can be done
in Cash, and to convince the Dey of our readiness to meet our engagements punctually; and the Other, that as wheat is so necessary an

Article, and so very scarce it might have a good effect to shew that
we are attentive to give that facility to such indispensible wants, as
will prove our Friendship in a double Point of view; at the same time
there is no doubt of its making R, handsome Profit, as it is of a very
Superior Quality, and in the Very best order. Let these impressions
be made in the fullest manner. There are two Packages of letters & Papers for the British Consul,
put into my hands by Sir Alexander Ball, which I beg you will deliver
to him, with my best Compliments, and expressions of the pleasure
which Mr? Lear & m self promise ourselves from having him in our
neighbourhood. - $here is also a Package for Ma Norderling of some
things which she requested Mr? Lear to purchase for her here, and a
letter for her enclosed. The amount of the Articles [ space ] dollars
MImear has sent to her, which you may receive, if offered, but do
not wish to demand it, as it may stand till we return.
I shall give you a short history of our Voyage &: and a Statement
of our situation with respect to Tripoli. - We had a pleasant passage from Algiers to the Coast of Tripoli, where we first heared of the
Attacks made by Commodore Preble, who had then left that Station
with the force under his Command, We found there the U.S. Frigate
President Commodore Sam! Barron, and the Constellation CaptQ
Campbell. As the Operations, against Tripoli for this season were
given up, and no prospect of opening an immediate Negotiation, we
went on board the Commodore, who was going to Syracuse, and sailed
for that place, where we remained about ten days and then came over
here, where we have been stationary ever since, excepting a short trip
which I made to Syracuse in Jan? last to see Commodore Barron who
was very ill, and who returned hither with me. - we have met with
every attention here that we could wish, and have passed our time
very agreeably; but my anxiety to return to Algiers, and for the ill
Health of Commodore B. ever Since we first met him has been great.
But I did not think it proper for me to return to Algiers untill I should
have been able to effect the Object of my mission; or put it beyond
an expectation of doing so. Thus has the Winter passed on without
effecting anything, as the Communications from Tripoli, Gave no
hope of a d'esprit on the part of the Bashaw to make peace on admissable terms. Lately there seems to be a Change in his Sentiments,
as he finds the Season for Active Operations Approaching, and knows
our force to be considerable, and our determination Strong to act on
the Offensive against him; I am therefore in hopes that a few weeks
will decide the matter, whether we shall settle our differences by negotiation; or try the effect of our Cannon. I n either case, I presume I
shall be able to depart for Algiers in the course of two months. I n the
mean time, I trust that every thing will remain quiet and friendly in
that uarter; and especially as i t is possible we may have a rupture
with unis, the Bey of which has been long Speaking in a threatening
sent in here a few days ago a Cruizer of
tone, and as Capt-odgers
eight guns who calls himself a Tunesian, and was going with two Italian Vessels, his prizes, into Tripoli, then blockaded by our Ships. If
the Bey is serious in his tjhlreats, he will not fail to put them now in
execution, unless he is deterred by the Napoletan Squadron, which is
said to be in his Bay, This information i s for yourself alone.
As your commumcation is again open with Europe, I presume it is
unnecessary to say that the French Fleet have got out of Toulon, and

passed the Straits, followed by Lord Nelson, of whom they had the

You will observe that the Capt? of the Polacre has 35 running days
to take in and deliver his Cargo, after which he allows ten days demurage at 10 dolls per day. The time of his delay here will be noted on
the back of the Charter party, which I presume will not exceed 10. or
i 2 , which will allow him 23 or 25 for discharging without encroaching
upon his ten days of demurage. - The ship will not return here as
she is chartered for another Voyage, as the Capt? can shew by his
Charter party
I have not received a line from the U. S. since I left Algiers, neither
has the Commodore had any official advices from thence. Mp Lear has but indifferent health since she has been here; but I
flatter myself that the settled weather which we may now expect, and
the sea air, will restore to her again that invaluable blessing, She sends
her best regards to you, and says.it is unnecessary to desire you to
take care of all our things, as she IS sure it will be done, and that an
attention to airing such as may be injured by laying will not be omitted. - Mr Henly is in good health, and desired his best regards, when
we last saw him. - He is now on the Coast of Tripoli in the Frigate
Constitution, CaptWodgers, of which ship he is second Lieu! and bids
fair to be an honor to his Country & friends as an attentive Active, and
enterprizing Officer. - Capt: S. Decateur Commands the Congress.Our Small Vessels are now all out; but as soon as one can be spared,
I shall request her to be sent to Algiers to see how matters stand there,
and bring letters from you & $ I shall write a few lines to the Sweedish Consul if I have time, if
not present my best regards &F to him as also to the French, Spanish,
Danish and Dutch Consuls and their respective families in which &I*
Lear unites with me, also to M &- Mce Ferarea to D' R,lartiningo, to
Mess'".
& B. say all Complaisant things. To the Drogennan, Sidi
,Ui, Francisco and all the Others of our family let us be remembered.I must impress upon you the necessii y of great caution & .circumspection in all your Conduct, which I am persuaded I shall have cause
to approve
Wishing you the enjoyment of health and every Blessing

To Bacri & Busnah, Algiers, from Tobias Lear, U. S. Consul General, Algiers

MALTA,
April SOt@1805
GENTLEMENI have sent to Algiers the Imperial Polacre Ship

Premura, Capt? Bartolomeo Smucheriech, with a Cargo of the best
hard wheat, consisting of fourteen hundred Salms of hlalta, which
I have Consigned to your address, to be sold to the best advantage. The Charter Party, Invoice and Bills of Lading, you will receive from
hiIr Mountford. Having heared that Wheat was very scarce at Algiers I have been
induced to send this Cargo, in Order to place there a Sum of Money
to pay one years Annuity from the United States of America to His
Excellency the Dey and the Regency of Algiers if he should be disposed to receive an Annuity in Cash to the Amount of 30,000 dollars. I send Tilrheath in preference to money, to Shew our disposition
to supply that necessary Article where it is so much wanted. - I
hope it will turn to good Account - Our Annuity was settled up to
the 25 day of March 1804, and we have sent one Cargo since, the
amount of which I do not yet know. If the balance up to March
1805, can be paid in Cash I shall be much pleased, as it will convince
the Dey of our wish to be punctual in our payments, when the distance from our Country is so great as to make the Arrival of Cargoes
from thence very uncertain.- If a payment can be made in Cash you
will hold the balance of the proceeds of this Cargo subject,to my orders.
If Cash will not be received, you will be pleased to hold the whole of
the proceeds, after paying the freight, subject to like Orders. There
is a Supercargo named Luigi Paduanai who goes in this Vessel. He
saw the Cargo put on board, and will attend to its delivery I have been much longer from Algiers than I expected, as I did not
find an opportunity of negotiating with the Bashaw of Tripoli upon
terms which were likely to bring about a peace. -The[rej is now a
prospect of coming to terms, which if effected, will enable me to return
very soon to Algiers, where I wish much to be.
I have heared of the attack made on the life of his Excellency the
Dey of Algiers, which I am happy to find did not take the effect
intended. - I salute him on his escape and wish him many happy
years. [Stephen Decatur Col. ?IDA photostat, Book A,.]

TOthe Swedish Consul, Algiers, from Tobias Leor, U. 8. Consul General, Algiers

MALTA,A p d SOtQ1805
The Honb'Wonsul NORDERLING
DEARSIR This is the first direct Opportunity which I have had
of Writing to Algiers since I left that place, and I do not fail of embracing it to inform you of the Welfare of M r G e a r and myself, and to
express our wishes that you, your good Lady and Children may enjoy
every blessing. Our passage from Algiers to Sicily and this place was very pleasant
and we have had every reason to be pleased with our residence here,
and the attention which we have received. - Notwithstanding
which, we still wish to be again a t Algiers, considering that as our
home for some time at least. - we have been absent much longer
than we expected, as no occasion has yet offered of terminating the
