ALGIERS
Julze 8 t b 1786
THOMAS
JEFFERSON
Esq! HONOURED
SIR I take the Liberty of addressing these letters to
you hoping you will excuse the freedom of an American kc. and unfortunate captive at present. No doubt but Mr Lamb has given
you and M: Adams every articular information respecting the state
of affairs in Algiers. I am much s rized when I look a t the date
of your letter to us being the 4'Q o s o v e m b e r & with orders to ME
Lamb to redeem us Americans. I am surprized that from the 4'4
of November until the 2oth of March that Mr Lamb did not get our
redemption ascertained by some person in Algiers. But he retarding

2

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1785 TO 1801

the time until he could make it convenient to come himself and not
informing himself of the method generally used towards the redemption of captives, but on the contrary comes to Algiers and gives out
that he came to redeem the Americans.
I t was immediately signified to the Dey that Mr Lamb had brought
money for that purport, it became such a town talk that the Dey
hard1 knew what sum to ask. after a few days the Dey asks what
sum ! k r Lamb would give. M? Lamb signified he would give ten
thousand dollars. the Dey then said 50,000. I think the demand
was very a propos to the offer of Mr Lamb. Mr Lamb tried to get
the Dey to lower his price, but the Dey was determined not to lower
his price any thing worth mentioning.
We are much surprized that Mr Lamb should bring so trifling a
sum as five or six thousand dollars to redeem 21. Even if the Dey
had let us go agreeable to your calculation he could not have redeemed
us. But Mr Lamb when he first arrived told us he would get us
along in a few days, which much disappointed us, for he afterwards
told us he had no money to redeem us. what he had was for presents
if he succeeded in a cessation of hostilities with this Regency. one
time he would say his funds were in Holland - then in Spain, and
then that you & Mr Adams had given no power only to draw for Â£3300
stie & that Mr Randal must write the order. so that in his own
language his hands were tyed by the ministers. I believe the Dey
of Algiers was well convinced that Americans would give the sum he
asked. I have reason to suspect that the Dey had a hint conveyed
to him by the British Consul, who you may be assured is an inveterate
enemy to the Americans. about 5 months ago I wrote Mr Carmichael
that the British Consul had put himself to great trouble in sending
expresses to his court. about that time was the first time that he
knew that it was the intention of the Americans to sue for a peace
with the Barbary States. I t is not the interest of any commercial
nation that the Americans should obtain a peace with the Barbary
States, whilst they reap such benefits in being the carriers of our
commerce, particularly the English, French & Spanish being jealous
of us. Consider Sir what great insurance we pay in getting our
vessels insured. in a short time the great insurance we pay would
obtain us a peace, or our ships obliged to be sold or with the greatest
difliculty in procuring English registers and passes - if not soon
remedied our trade must fall into some other chanel. and with the
greatest difficulty we shall retrieve it again, our seamen having no
longer employment in the United states but must through necessity
seek a living in some other country. The British Consul I think
informs his court respecting the time when the Algerine cruisers
generally go out by that means the people of England take the greatest advantage on insurin American property. and is their policy
& benefit to spread the f a m much greater than i t really is. there
er of our commerce being prevented by the Algerines if
we
keep c ear of the streights, coasts of Spain &Q Portugal and the
is no
Madeiras. we may trade to France, England, Holland, Sweden
and any where to the N. of 44' N. LatdP
The Algerine cruisers generally go out in April but uncommon
they went out the 25th of May this year. they generdly make three
crwses a year finish about the 20t5 November & then unrig & ly b
until the next year. the Algerines have no merchant ships or vesse

dY

for trade excepting a few coasting craft which go along shore with
wheat &c the French b u g thew carriers in commerce & nothing
great. their marine strength is nine sail of xebecs, one of 32 guns,
one of 30. three of 24 and three of 18. and one of 12 guns - the
vessels are small to the metal they carry. X of the crews are Turks.
the remainder Algerine Moors.
A war with the Algerines would be a very expensive war they
having no merchant men ~t would be attended m t h a very great
expence, on our slde the expence of building a force adequate to the
Ugerines to get men to keep that force in commission. and still
it would be a great risque to trade, you are fully sensible the sum i t
would take ta redeem a few - and then it would dter the insurance
but trifling.
The United States should use every means to obtain a peace with
the Barbary States, although it would cost vast sums, for until all
obstacles are removed that prevent commerce we cannot expect to
be a commercial nation. it is bad policy to use any threats or make
any parade with cruisers if we intend suing for a peace, but on the
contrary let these people see that we are inclinable for a peace - no
doubt but it was great policy in the Dey to refuse Mc Lamb a t first
on the terms of peace. consider Sir the policy of this Regency in all
their transactions with the Christian nations. but I believe they are
inclinable to a peace with the Americans but should for political
views be negotiated very private, particularly by the Americans. I
believe they gave Mr Lamb su5cient reason to believe so. they seem
well inclined to a peace with us, and I believe would take some naval
stores as masts, yards, planks, scantling, tar & turpentine. the
English, French, Dutch, Danes & Swedes and I may say all nations
are tributary to them - making them valuable presents & supplying
them. The Algerines would never redeem or make an exchange with
any nation they should be at war with. the Dey of &em cares not
about his people particularly the Moors. the Turks he sets a little
store by. those nations that he has been at war with for ages have
experienced it. i t is the policy of Christian nations to keep those
nations of Turks & Moors at war with other Christian Nations. and
the people in general here wish for a war with those nations in the
streights, for I am sure that nothing but so great s sum as the Spaniards
are to give would reconcile those people to the Spaniards, they having
such an inveteracy against them for persecuting the Mahometan
religion -but money is the God of Algiers & Mahomet their prophet.
they like those nations that they are afraid of & that give them most.
But should the Algerines be influenced by the commercial Christian
nations not to make a peace with the United States, then we should
exert ourselves & fit out ships mounting about 24. guns. nine of that
force and two brigs, a schooner also -fast sailing vessels & have them
coppered for the sooner we would harrass those people the better for
we ~houldif so lucky as to take two or three of them. they would be
mclmable to a peace and on easier terms for us. To rendezvous at
Mahon & Gibraltar, and often to come in sight of Algiers. and I
make no doubt when they found a spirited nation against them they
would alter their opinion. not to be afraid of them like unto those
dastardly natiops, that have given them such reason to boast of a
superiority in courage to Christians. The Algerines have 55. gun
boats in case of an invasion or attack on the city which is very strong

4

being well fortified & I think they are a tolerable smart active people,
spirited in an attack, but with any thing of a warm reception easily
repulsed. they put great confidence in boarding therefore ought to
be well barracked. if they can avoid an action it is their choice to be
off.
The Algerines do not expect to derive any great advantage by
being at war with the Americans, our country being so far situated
from them, they will not attempt to approach our coasts. they have
very little Idea of America and I believe the British Consuls used their
influence in signifying to the Algerines the unjustness of our cause,
but since we arrived here we used our influence to convince them of
the justness of our quarrel which they say that if they were in our
situation they would do the same. There is a great difference between
negociating with those people and a Christian nation. the foundation
of all treaties should be laid by some person or Consul in Algiers that
knows how to treat with them for there are certain times & seasons
for those affairs. The Dey's sentiments aIways ought to be well
sounded and the sentiments of his ministers and head men for it is
by them all business is transacted with him for they have the Dey's
ear at command particularly the Causennage who is head minister.
the Micklassha is the next. he is son in law to the Causennage and
is Generalissimo of all the Fortiiications - entire direction of the
Marine - a particular favorite of the Dey, and I think no man fills
his office better. a valuable present to the Micklassha & Causennage
chosen by some man that is well acquainted with what suits those
men best. I am sure it would be very requisite & not hove away.
The Dey is well advanced in years, and I am sure when he goes to
his long home that there will be a very great change in the state of
affairs in this Regency. The Causennage will be his successor & the
Micklassha will be the prime minister. If anyone knows those peoples
policy I should think the Count DIExpilly does; being a year here
negociating the Spanish peace & has had so many conferences with
the Dey & his ministers. he has got the great men in office on his
side. Give a Turk money with one hand & you may take his Eyes
out with the other.
Since the Brig arrived from Tunis which is the brig which Mr Lamb
came to Algiers in, the brig was overhawled & the Captain examined
by the Micklassha respecting the property. I am credibly informed
by a Gentleman by the name of Capt. Bassline, who is a great favorite
of the Micklassha's, that the Micklassha was well convinced by the
information he had that the brig was an American property, which I
heard the evening the brig arnved in &em.
but the Micklassha
despised any such mean action but s i m e d to the Dey that the
report was false. I hope this particular favor shewn the Americans
by the Micklassha will not escape your notice but by every prudent
step cultivate the friendship of so great & so good a man. The
information by all I can learn & I have every reason to believe was
given by the British Consul, Mr Lamb's bosom friend. it is said
& I have been credibly informed that Mr Logie had the information
from a M? Gregory British Consul in Barcelona, and I should think
it a very dangerous affair for the brig to come to Algiers again particularly with money for or redemption as there is no knowing the
policy and political views of those people in Algiers. Permit me to
mention to you that if it was not convenient to redeem US when the

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS

time is advanced which Mc Lamb signified to the Dey that it would
be good policy to get us on the Spanish list as the Spaniards have
not yet agreed on the price for their people; and inasmuch as the
Count DIExpilly may get us for less than what the Dey asks, and as
we were taken on the time when the Spaniards were about settling a
truce unknown to the Americans. Delays breed danger & opportunity
once lost is not easily recovered, and our captivity will become an
old affair and here we shall remain.
The American peace hangs on a thread but I make no doubt if well
planned but the United States will obtain it.
The Neapolitan & Portuguese Ambassadors are shortly expected
here, it is uncertain that they will obtain a peace, but if they do I will
engage the Portuguese particularly will pay well for lt. The Spaniards
have not surmounted all their difficulties yet with those people.
but I believe i t will take some time yet - a few days ago arrived a
Venitian & a French Vessel with shot &c. for the Dey. The Venitian
brought their tribute which was about 10,000 Algerine sequins and
about 5,000 dollars worth of presents, but they accepted the tribute &
I believe would not accept the presents. so that it is supposed when
the Algerines settle with the Spaniards that they will be apt to commit
hostilities on the Venitians. such tricks are very common to them.
I t is believed Mr John Wolfe will not get to be Spanish Consul in
Algiers, but I am very sure he is a very good man; no one in Algiers
better acquanted with the ways & policy of this Regency and would
be a very fit man to transact an business for any nation. I refer you
to M: Carmichael & Mr Itand& for his character and must observe
that there is no doing any thing among those people without mone
all the crowned heads in Europe to write to the Dey of Algiers wo&
avail but very little. to negotiate a peace with the Algemes should
be a statesman well acqunnted with the different languages. but as I
have said before the foundation should be laid by some Consul in
Algiers whom the United States could depend on and then an American
to come & conclude it. A good Consul is very requisite here.
We are much surprized at M: h b ' s ungentleman like behaviour
whilst he was in Algiers & could hardly believe Congress would [have]
sent such a man to negociate so important an affair as the making a
peace with the Algerines where it required the most able Statesman
& Politician.
The Count disapproved of his behaviour much & said he was a very
uncapable man to treat for the redemption of us & worse for making the
Peace. A man tbat has no regularity in small affairs m 4 l have none in
great ones. There is no Consul or man that has the least friendship
for the Americans but says he was a very unable man & not the
gentleman, which I believe sir, when we can make such an observation
On him we are sensible that a man of your abilities can have no great
opinion of him.
Mr Lamb's unguarded expressions, his hints, threats &c. despising
the French & Spaniards, signifying their deciet & in fact every thing
that he possibly could utter in the most vulgar language that i t was
mth pain we see him so unworthy of his commission & the cloth he
wore. his particular intimacy with Mc Logie the British Consul,
M! Iamb's bosom friend who I believe got all his secrets frqm
~ a l doften that the Americans had taken two forts on the M ~ s s ~ s s l p ~
from the Spaniards and often in the hearing of some servants who

NAVAL OPERATIOhTS FROM 1786 TO 1801

6

spoke English that if the Spaniards did not assist the Americans in
making their peace that we should take some of their territory from
them. no doubt but the Count was informed of all this. for one of
Mr Lamb's servants is servant to the Count a t present, & Mr Lamb
often said in my presence to Mr Wolfe that he (meaning M' Wolfe)
or the Count would have all the honor of laying the foundation of the
peace.
Sir we are very sensible of your particular attention to us, & through
your & Mr Carmichaels care of us, we are indebted for the particular
civility & attention of the Ct D'Expilly & French Consul. But still
it is impossible for us to be content whdst we are under the character
of slaves, so disagreeable is confinement to the men of the Land of
Liberty. My crew go through the severities of slavery that is possible
for men to endure. Capt? Stevens & Coffi have families. & a t
present unknown how provided for. I have an aged mother, brother
& sisters. that their whole dependance & subsistence was on me.
certainly the longer we stay here the greater expence we shall incur
on our country. If we do not make our grievances known to you sir I
am sure who can we apply to we have wrote to America when we were
first taken, but not one of us has received a letter & cannot tell what
our country has resolved on respecting us. we must submit to our
hard fate & trust to God & our country to extricate us from Algiers.
I hope Mr Barclay will succeed with the Maroccians - their situation
being more in the way of annoying us than the Algerines. I am surprized M': Lamb did not pay Mr Logie the small sum of about 5 guineas
which Mr Logie paid to the marine for excluding us from it. M'
Lamb often insisted Mr Logie to make some charge, but at last Logie
made a charge & Mr Lamb did not pay him.

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1786 TO 1801

To John Adams, U. 8. Minister to London, England, from Thomas Jefferson,
V. S . Minister to Paris, France

PARIS,
July 11, 1786.
DEAR
SIR,-Our btrurtions relative to the Barbary States having
required us to proceed by way of negotiation to obtain their peace, it
became our duty to do this to the best of our power. Whatever might
be our private opinions, they were to be suppressed, and the line,
marked out to us, was to be followed. It has been so, honestly and
zealously. I t was, therefore, never material for us to consult together,
on the best plan of conduct towards these States. I acknowledge, I
very early thought it wodd be best to effect a peace through the
medium of war. Though it is a question with which we have nothing
to do, yet as you propose some discussion of it, I shall trouble you
with my reasons. Of the fonr positions laid don- in your letter of
the 3d instant, I agree to the three first, which are, in substance, that
the good offices of our friends cannot procure us a peace, without
paying its pnce; that they cannot ma.terially lessen that price; and
that payiDg it, we can have the peace m spite of the intngues of our
enemies. As to the fourth, that the longer the negotiation is delayed,
the larger will be the demand; this will depend on the intermediate
captures: if they are many and rich, the price may be raised; il few
and poor, i t will be lessened. However, if it is decided that we shall
buy a peace, I know no reason for delaying the operation, but should
rather think it ought to be hastened; but I should prefer the obtaining
i t by wm.
1. Justice is in favor of this opinion. 2. Honor favors it. 3. I t
will procure us respect in Europe; and respect is a. safeguard to interest.
4. It wiU arm the federal head with the safest of all the instruments of
coercion over its delinquent members, and prevent i t from using what
would be less safe. I think that so far, you go with me. But in the
next steps, we shall m e r . 5. I think i t least expensive. 6. Equallv
effectual. I ask a fleet of one hundred and fifty uns, the one-half of
which shall be in constant cruise. This fleet, bui t, manned and victualled for six months will cost four hundred and fifty thousand pounds
sterling. Its annual expense will be three hundred pounds sterling a
gun, including everything; this will be forty-five thousand pounds
sterling a year. 1 take British experience for the basis of my calculation: though vie know, from our own experience, that we can do in
this way, for pounds lawful, what costs them pounds sterhg. Were
we to charge all this to the Algerine war, i t would amount to little
more than we must pay, if we buy peace. But as it is proper tmd
necessary that we should establish a small marine force, (even were
we to buy a peace from the Algerines,) and as that force, laid up in
our dock-yards, wodd cost us half as much annually, as if kept in
order for service, we have a right to say that only twenty-two thousand
and five hundred pounds sterling, per annum, should be charged to
the Algerine war. 6. It will be as effectual. To all the mismanagements of Spain and Portugal, ur ed to show that war against those
people is ineffectual, I urge a sing e fact to prove the contrary, where
there is any management. About forty years ago, the Algerines
having broke their treaty with France, this court sent Monsieur de
Massiac, with one large, and two small f ' ates; he blockaded the
harbor of Algiers three months, and they su scribed to the terms he

f

proposed. If it be admitted, however, that war, on the fairest prospects, is still exposed to uncertainties, I weigh against this, the greater
uncertainty of the duration of a peace bought with money, from such
a people, from a Dey eighty years old, and by a nation who, on the
hypothesis of buying peace, is to have no power on the sea, to enforce
an observance of it.
So far, I have gone on the supposition that the whole weight of this
war would rest on us. But, 1. Naples wiU join us. The character of
their naval minister (Acton), his known sentiments with respect to
the peace Spain is officiously trying to make for them, and his dispositions against the Algerines, give the best grounds to believe it. 2.
Every principle of reason assures us that Portugal will join us. I
state this as taking for granted, what all seem to believe, that they
w i l l not be at peace with Algiers. I suppose, then, that a convention
might be formed between Portugal, Naples and the United Stabs, by
which the burthen of the war might be quotaed on them, according
to their respective wealth; and the term of it should be, when
em
should subscribe to a peace with all three, on equal t e r r n s . ~ h i s
might be left open for other nations to accede to, and many, if not
most of the powers of Europe, (except France, England, Holland, and
Spain, if her peace be made) would sooner or later enter into the confederacy, for the sake of having their peace with the piratical States
guaranteed by the whole. I suppose, that, in this case, our proportion of force would not be the half of what I first calculated on.
These are the reasons which have influenced my judgment on this
question. I give them to you, to show you that I am imposed on by a
semblance of reason, at least; and not with an expectation of their
changing your opinion. You have viewed the subject, I am sure, in
dl its bearing. You have weighed both questions, with all their circumstances. You make the result different from what I do. The
same facts impress us differently. This is enough to make me suspect
an error in my process of reasoning, though T am not able to detect it.
It is of no consequence; as I have nothing to say in the decision, and am
ready to proceed heartily on any other plan which may be adopted, if
my agency should be thought useful. With respect to the dispositions of the State, I am utterly uninformed. I cannot help thinking,
however, that on a view of all the circumstances, they might be united
in either of the plans.
Having written this on the receipt of your letter, without knowing of
any opportunity of send in,^ it, I know not when it will go- I add nothing, therefore, on any other subject, but assurances of the sincere
esteem and respect with which I am, dear Sir, your friend and servant.

DEARSIR,- I have received the ratification of the Prussian treaty,
and next Thursday shall set off for the Hague, in order to exchange i t

with the Baron de Thulemeier.
Your favor of the 11th instant I have received. There are great
and weighty considerations urged in it in favor of arming against the
Algerines, and, I confess, if our States could be brought to agree in the
measure, I should be very willing to reaolve upon extarnal war with

12

vigor, and protect our trade and people. The resolution to fight them
would raise the spirits and courage of our countrymen immediately,
and we might obtain the glory of f i n d breaking up these nests of
banditti. But congress will never, or at east not for years, take any
such resolution, and in the mean time our trade and honor suffers
beyond calculation. We ought not to fight them at all, unless we
determine to fight them forever.
This thought, I fear, is too rugged for our people to bear. To f i ~ h t
them a t the expense of millions, and make eace, after all, by g i m
more money and larger presents than wo d now procure perpetua
peace, seems not to be economical. Did Monsieur de Massac carry
his point without making the presents? Has not France made presents ever since? Did any nation ever make peace with any one
Barbary state without making the presents? Is there an example of
it? I believe not, and fancy you w i l l find that even Massac himself
made the presents.
I agree ~n opinion of the wisdom and necessity of a navy for other
uses, but am apprehensive it will make bad worse with the Algerines.
I will go all lengths with you in promoting a navy, whether to be
applied to the Algerines or not. But I think, at the same time, we
should treat. Your letter, however, has made me, easier upon this
point. Nevertheless, to humble the Algerines, I think you have
undercalculated the iorce necessary. They have now fifty gun-boats,
which, being small objects against great ships, are very formidable.*
None of these existed in the time of Monsieur Massac. The harbor
of Algiers, too, is fortified all round, which i t was not in M. Massac's
time, which renders i t more difficult and dangerous to attempt a
blockade. I know not what dependence is to be put upon Portugal
and Naples, in case of I-L war with the barbarians; perhaps they might
assist us in some degree. Blocking Algiers would not obtain peace
with Morocco; so that our commerce would still be exposed.
After all, though I am glad we have exchanged a letter on the subject, I preceive that neither force nor money will be applied. Our
States are so backward, that they will do nothing for some years.
If they get money enough to discharge the demands upon them in
Europe already incurred, I shall be agreeably disappointed. A disposition seems rather to prevail amon our citizens ta give up a11 idem
of navigation and naval power, and ay themselves consequent1 a t
the mercy of foreigners, even far the prices of therr produce. f t is
their concern, and we must submit; for your plan of fighting will no
more be adopted, than mine of treating. This is more humiliating to
me than 'ving the presents would be. I have a letter from Mr. Jay
but an acknowledgment of
of 7th J&, by packet, oontabng not*
our letter of 25th April. New Hampshm and Rhode Island have
suspended their navigation acts, and Massachusetts, now left alone,
w i l l suspend theirs. So that all will be left to the convention, whose
system, if they form one, will not be completed, adopted, and begin to
operate, under &eve& years. Congress have received the answer,
which you saw, to my memorial of 30th November; and Mr. Ramsay
writes me he is not &tressed a t it, because it will produce a repeal of
all the laws against recovering private debts.

Four weeks ago we learned by the master of a Swedish Ship from
Alicant that M' Lamb had sent the brig with his despatches for Congress $ that he expected an answer shortly. We recieved a letter
from him yesterday dated in Alicant of the 7t@Inst. he informs us that
matters turned out so that he sent the brig for America, & that he
expected shortly to have new orders. I am v e y confident that MI
Adams & M Jefferson acted for the best, but take the liberty of
mentioning to you that it was badly planned & worse executed, but I
am much s u ~ r b e dthat they were not better informed respecting
From Mc Jefferson's letter he expected that we

would be redeemed & wished us a happy sight of our country. Mr
Lamb said & shewed me his orders that M Lamb's limits were only
100 dollars for a sailor. I am sure no man could think we possibly
could be redeemed at that price. M' Lamb declared he had but 6000
dollars, & that was not appropriated for us, but for presents to these
peoples. I have mentioned you in the proper manner to ME Wolfe.
he has been unwell these five weeks. M' Wolfe also has mentioned

14

you.@ very friendly language to us, & has a very great opinion of your
abihties & that you had behaved m t h great zeal to serve your country.
We are losing a very favorable opportunity in Algiers respecting
paving the way towards our peace which is of very great importance
to the United States. perhaps the ministers have some other plan in
view. M: Lamb's plan was to set all Europe a fighting or to take some
of the Spanish territory in America & thereby oblige the Spaniards to
make our peace. he ought not to have thought it much more say it.

* * *

I am informed that Mr Barclay has effected a peace with Morocco.
I hope it may be so, their situation being more detrimental to our com-

merce than the Algerines. The Algerine cruisers of nine sail of chebecks sailed the 14th of August and to this date has but sent in one
prize which was a s m d vessel of 40 ton belonging to Sardinia. their
number on board was 14 men & a woman, supposed of some rank. I
hope no American will be so unlucky as to fall in their way as nothing
would be more detrimental to the peace & our redemption. I am informed by the master of a vessel lately from Gibraltar that there had
been a ship belonging to Baltimore or Philadelphia there loaded with
flour & that after discharging her cargo, she sailed for Malaga. I wish
they would be more sparing of their American colours in the streights.
I t is well known in Algiers that such vessels are in Spain.

Respecting the Portuguese Mr Logie says the Dey would not listen
to any proposition the Count made, for he said & they generally say
here that they have made too much peace, & that if they were to make
a peace with the Portuguese that they would have no nation worth
cruising against. I t seems reasonable to me this regency will be always
at war with some nations that they are not a f r ~ dof being invaded
by, & it is greatly in favor of the American peace that we are so far
situated from them that they cannot go on our coasts, not like those
nations in the streights that the Algerines in 36 hours are on their
coasts & successful in taking prizes. The Dey said to the Count
when he asked for a peace for the Neapolitans that be would miramus,
or see about it. Those people will not have many negotiations on hand
at one time; they want to get done with one thing first, before they
begin another. * * *
We are treated with a great deal of civility by the French consul
and Mr Gimong a French merchant here. Monsr Ford the gentleman we are boarded with is a worthy respectable character & does
every thing in his power to make our situation agreeable. I hope the
French & Spanish will experience the like return & be treated with
much lenity in America. We are four at Mr Ford's, five in the Dey's
house and one at the Swedish consuls and eleven in the marine, where
the poor men endure the severities of slavery. I wrote a long letter
by the Count to Mr Jefferson, but have no answer a s yet. * * *

employed on fhe most laborious work & so much exhausted that if some
speedy measure is not adopted to redeem them from slavery I am
afraid they will all be carried off by the pest, as it rages much, on the
226 of this month there died 215 people in Algiers, & in those three
months past there have died 200 Christian slaves. The Spaniards &
Neapolitans having redeemed their people there are a t present but
800 slaves belonging to Bylicke & about 120 slaves belonging to privata
property. Therefore we expect to be called to the marine as there is
a scarcity of slaves at present to do the requisite duty on board the
Algerine cruisers. One of my crew is dead and another after having
the pest 14 days with two large buboes on him i t has pleased God
that he should recover. * * * I t is my sincere opimon that the
Dey & his Ministers consider that they made a regular bargain with
M Lamb for our ransom, & I believe it is recorded so on the public
books of this regency, & should not be surprized if another American
Ambassador was to come to Algiers, at the Dey's t e b g him he hsd
made one bargain already with the Americans, which they did not
fulfill.
I t seems the Neapolitan Ambassador had obtained a truce wit,h
this Regency for three months, & the Ambassador wrote his court
of his success, but about the l U tof April when the cruisers were fitting
out the Ambassador went to the Dey & hoped the Dey would give
the necessary orders to the Captains of his cruisers not to take the
Neapolitan vessels. the Dey said the meaning of the truce was for
not to take the Neapolitan cruisers, but if his chebecs should meet
the Neapolitan merchantmen to take them & send them for Algiers.
The Ambassador said that the Neapolitan cruisers would not want a
pass on those terms. the Dey said if his chebecks should meet either
men of war or merchant vessels to take them, so gave orders accordingly. The Blgerines sailed the 9%inst. & are gone I believe off the
coast of Italy. This shews there is very little confidence to be put
in the ro al word. no principle of national honor will bind those
people & believe not much confidence to be put in them in treaties.
The Algerines are not inclinable to a peace, with the Neapolitans.
I hear of no negotiation. when the two frigates arrive with the
money for the ransom of the slaves I believe they are done with the
Neapolitans. Theb] being so handily situated to them, in 24 hours
the cruisers are on the coasts of Italy, which is a great inducement for
not making s peace. On the 2 3 G s t . anived a Neapolitan prize to
the Algerines, & on the 25'h arrive a Neapolitan Jittan [or Jithan]
a prize. They were taken near the gulph of Genoa. The crews of
them escaped with their boats. This is a great inducement to the
Algerines not to make a peace with the N e a p o l i t ~ &
, the Algerines
being under no dread of a bombardment on them city, therefore if
they should obtain a peace, the terms will certainly be very high.
I t certainly makes a great difference with these people, a making
peace with Naples or America. for they well know we are situated
a t a great distance from them, & if we do not come in their way they
will not go on our coasts being a great dmtance & navigation that
they are not acquainted with. The Neapolitans are very handy to
them & having many merchant vessels, the Blgerines are generally
attended with success in taking some every cruise.

!I

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1786 TO 1801
The Spaniards have paid a great sum for their peace 1,200,000
dollars is the sum paid m Algiers. The Government is very rich &
the Dey is very political. No nation can fit out an equal number of
cruisers so cheap as the Dey of Algiers. In Algiers the cruisers are
not all public vessels, there me about three out of the nine that belong
to Bylic, the rest belong to head-oscers as Prime minister, General
of the Marine, & General of the County, Lord of the Bed-chamber &c.
Those great men owning the cruisers, they do not wish for peace with
these nations in the Streights. The present Dey is very old, & I
believe cannot live many ears. when he goes to his long home I dare
say there will be a great c ange in the policy of this Regency, making
war on some & making peace with others. It is a great thing in a
peace with Algiers to make the treaty with the Dey that has just got
the government in his hands as i t may be more likely he might keep
to the treaty he made himself & they generally do not mind what
treaties the former Deys make. I t is customary with every Dey to
renew all treaties. Tunis being tributarg to Algiers it would be
requisite in the treaty with Algiers to notice Tunis. I t is not very
easy to know the proper way of laying the foundation of a treaty with
those Algerines. Be assured that the foundation of all treaties should
be laid by some person that could be depended on in Algiers, & then a
wise man to come & conclude the treaty. I should not put much
confidence in any Consul in Algiers to have the managing of the
American treaty. for i t is well known that those nations that are a t
perace with the Barbary States do not wish that any other nation should
obtain a peace, that they should not reap part of those advantageous
branches of commerce in the Mediterranean. Before the mar the
Americans used to employ 200 sail of merchantmen in the streights
trade, & used to reap great advantages by it, but a t present our
trade is but smaIl being cramped on all quarters, which must certainly
hurt the Americans much, & when once commerce gets into mother
chanel, it is a long time before i t is brought back again. Certainly
the Indies of the French is their trade in the Mediterranean. The
French are too knowing to admit us to be sharers of this valuable
trade. They & many more trading nations will leave many obstacles
in the way of the Americans obtainkg a peace with the Barbary
States. The Algerines are in no measure depending on the Grand
Seignor. They reverence him on account of his being the head or
protector of their religion. a little from him to the Dey of Algiers
has some weight in favor of the nation whom the Grand Seignor writes
about but letters from the Christian Kings have no weight. Money
is their God & Mahomet their Prophet. The Dey of Algiers must
conduct himself agreeably to the Parliament or the Soldiery, he not
being absoIute in every affair. Those great men here must give their
voice, & i t must be attended to by the Dey. The Causnagee, that is
the prime minister $ second Dey, it is beheved will succeed the Dey,
in the government of this regency. The Mickelhassee, or general of
the marine & fortifications, ~sson in law to the Causnagee, & it is
supposed will be prime minister. This man has very great influence
& no man can fill his office better than he does, it is he who directs the
cruisers where to cruise, & I believe that any thing he mentions or
advises the Dey to has much weight. Amongst all those great men
the Mickelhassee I believe is most in favor of the Americans. There
should [be] some man that could be depended on here, have power to

E

17

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS

lay the foundation of the American treaty & those great men should
be paid much attention to that have the Dey's ear a t command. A
few valuable resents given in a proper season to these p e a t men
would not be ove away, as I am sure no nation can obttLln a peace
here without they gain some of those great men in their favour.
When Mr Lamb asked for a peace the Dey undoubtedly mid he would
not treat, the Dey not knowing the minds of his ministry then had some
of those great men been in favour of America they would have shewed
the Dey that a war with America could not be athnded with m y
advantage to the Algerines as we were so far off & they would have
courted the Dey to make a peace with America, & once you get those
great men in favour of s nation a s they rise in office, they have the
more influence & are more apt to keep the treaties that i t was their
wish the former Dey should make than to keep treaties that they
wished the Dey had never made.

Message of President George Washington to the Congress of the United States
PRISONERS AT

ALGIERS.

Message from the Presided of the United Stafes to Congress, communicating a report of the Secretary of State, in relation to American
prisoners a Algiers.
UNITEDSTATES,
December SO, 1790.
Gentlemen of the Senate and House of Representatives:
I lay before you a report of the Secretary of State on the subject of
the citizens of the United States in captivity at Algiers, that you may
provide on their behalf, what to you shall seem most expedient.
GEO.WASHINGTON.
[Report]

The Secretary of State, having had under consideration the situation of the citizens of the United States in captivity at Algiers, makes
the following report thereupon to the President of the United States:
When the House of Representatives, at their. late session, were
pleased to refer to the Secretary of State, the pehtion of our citizens
in captivity a t Algiers, there still existed some expectation that
certain measures, which had been employod to effect their redemption,
the success of which depended on their secrecy, might prove effectual.
Information received during the recess of Congress has so far weakened
those expectations, as to make it now a duty to lay before the President
of the United States, a full statement of what hm been attempted for
the relief of these our suffering citizens, as well before, as since he

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS

19

came into office, that he may be enabled to decide what further is to
be done.
On the 25th of July, 1785, the schooner Maria, captain Stevens,
belonging to a Mr. Foster, of Boston, was taken off Cape St. tTincen$s,
by an Algerine corsair; and, five days afterwards, the s h p Dnuphzn,
captain O'Brien, belonging to Messieurs lrvins of Philadelphia, was
taken by another Algerine, about fifty leagues westward of Lisbon.
These vessels, with their cargoes and crews, twenty-one persons in
number, were carried in to Algiers.
Congress had some time before commissioned ministers plenipotenfor entering into treaties of amity and commerce with the
Bar ary Powers, and to send to them proper agents for preparing
such treaties. An agent was accordingly appointed for Algiers, and
his instructions prepared, when the hfhisters Plenipotentiary received
information of these captures. Though the ransom of captives was
not among the objects expressed in their commissions, because at
their dates the case did not exist, yet they thought it their duty to
undertake that ransom, fearing that the captives might be sold and
dispersed through the interior and distant wuntries of Africa, if the
previous orders of Congress should be waited for. They therefore
added a supplementary instruction to the agent to negotiate their
ransom. But, while acting thus without authority, they thought
themselves bound to offer a price so moderate as not to be disapproved.
They therefore restrained him to two hundred dollars a man; which
was something less than had been just before paid for about three
hundred French captives, by the Mathurins, a religious order of France,
instituted in ancient times for the redemption of Christian captives
from the infidel Powers. On the arrival of the agent at Algiem, the
Dey demanded fifty-nine thousand four hundred and ninety-six
dollars for the twenty-one captives, and could be brought to abate
but little from that demand. The agent, therefore, returned in 1786,
without having effected either peace or ransom.
In the beginning of the next year, 1787, the minister plenipotentiary
of the United States at Paris procured an interview with the general
of the religious order of Mathurins, before mentioned, to engage him to
lend his agency, at the expense of the United States, for the redemption of their captive citizens. He proffered at once, all the services
he could render, with the liberalit and the zeal which distinguish his
character. He observed, that he ad agents on the spot, constantly
emploped in seeking out and redeeming the capt i ~ e of
s their own country; that these should act for us, as for themselves: that nothing wuid
be accepted for their agency; and that he would only expect that the
price of redemption should be ready on our part, so ns to cover the
engagement into which he should enter. He added, that, by the time
all expenses were paid, their last redemption had amounted to near
two thousand five hundred livres a man, and that he could by no
means flatter us that they could redeem our captives as cheap as their
own. The pirates would take advantage of its being out of their
ordinary line. Still he was in hopes they would not be much higher.
The proposition was then submitted to Congress, that is to say,
in February, 1787, and on the 19th of September, in the same year,
their minister plenipotentiary a t Paris received their orders to embrace
the ~ffersof the Mathurins. This he immediately notified to the
generd, observing, however, that he did not desire him to entar into

tiaT

K

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1786 TO 1801
any engagements till a sugcient sum to cover them should be actually
deposited in Paris. The generd wished that the whole might be
kept rigorously secret, as, should the barbarians suspect him to be
acting for the United States, they would demand such sums as he
could never agree to give, even with our consent, because it would
injure his future purchases from them. He said he had information
from his agent at Algiers, that our captives received so liberal a daily
allowance as to evince that i t came from a public source. He recommended that this should be discontinued; enga g that he would
have an allowance administered to them, much s ort indeed of what
they had hitherto received, but such as was given to his own countrymen, quite sufficient for physical necessities, and more likeIy to prepare the opinion, that as they were subsisted by his charity, they
were to be redeemed by it also. These ideas, suggested to him by
the danger of raising his market, were approved by the minister
plenipotentiary; because, this being the first instance of a redemption
by the United States, i t would form a precedent, because a high price
@en by us might induce these pirates to abandon all other nations
in pursuit of Americans; whereas, the contrary would take place,
could our price of redem~t~ion
be fixed a t the lowest point.
To destroy, therefore, every expectation of a redemption by the
United States, the bills of the Spanish cons111 at Algiers, who had
made the kind advances before spoken of for the sustenance of our
captives, were not answered. On the contrary, a hint was given that
these advances had better be discontinued, as i t was not known that
they would be reimbursed. It was necessary even to go further, and
to suffer the captives themselves and their friends to believe for a
while, that no attention was paid to them, no notice taken of their
letters. They are still under this impression. It mould have been
unsafe to trust them with a secret, the disclosure of which might for
ever prevent their redemption, by raising the demands of the captors
to sums which a due regard for our seamen, still in freedom, would
forbid us to give. This was the most trying of all circumstances,
and drew from them the most afflicting reproachcs.
It was a twelve month afterwards before the money could be deposited in Paris, and the negotiation be actually put into train. In
the mean time the general had received information from Algiers of a
very considerable change of prices there. Within the last two or
three years the Spaniards, the Neapolitans, and the Russians, had
redeemed at exorbitant sums. Slaves were become scarce, and would
hardly be sold at any price. Still he entered on the business with an
assurance of doing the best in his power; and he was authorized to
offer as far m three thousand livres, or five hundred and fifty-five
dollars a man. He wrote immediately to consult a confidential agent
at Marseilles, on the best mode of carrying this business into effect;
from whom he received the answer No. 2, hereto annexed.
Nothing further was known of his progress or prospects, when the
House of Representatives were pleased, a t their last session, to refer
the petition of our captives a t Algiers to the Secretary of State, The
preceding narrative shows that no report could have then been made
without risking the object, of which some hopes were still entertained.
Later advices, however, from the charge des daires of the United
States, a t Paris, informs us, that these measures, though not yet
dwperate, are not to be counted on. Besidea the exorbitance of

f?

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS

21

price, before feared, the late transfer of the lands and revenues of
the clergy in France to the public, by withdrawing the means, seems
to have suspended the proceedings of the Mathurins in the purposes
of their institution.
It is time, therefore, to look about for something more promising,
without relinquishing, in the mean while, the chance of success through
them. Endeavors to collect information, which have been continued
a considerable time, as to the ransoms which would probably be
demanded from us, and those actually paid by other nations, enable
the Secretary of State to lay before the President the following short
view, collected from original papers now in his possession, or from
information delivered to him personally. Passing over the ransoms
of the Mathurins, which are kept f a r below the common level by
special circumstances:
In 1786, the dey of Algiers demanded from our ngent 59,496 dollars
for 21 ca tives, which was 2,833 dollars a man. The agent flattered
himself t ey could be ransomed for 1,200 dollars apiece. His secretary informed us, at the same time, that Spain had paid 1,600 dollars.
In 1787, the Russians redeemed a t 1,546 dollars a man.
I n 1788, a well informed inhabitant of Algiers assured the minister
plenipotentiary of the United States at Paris, that no nation had
redeemed, since the Spanish treaty, a t less than from 250 to 300
pounds sterling, the medium of whichis 1,237dollars. Captain O'Brien,
at the same date, thinks we must pay 1,800 dollars, and mentions a
Savoy captain, just redeemed at 4,074 dollars.
In 1789, Mr. Logie, the English consul a t Algiers, informed a
person who wished to ransom one of our common sailors, that he would
cost from 450 to 500 pounds starling, the mean of which is 2,137 dollars.
In December of the same year, Captain O'Brien thiTlks our men w i l l
now cost 2,920 dollars each, though a Jew merchant believes he could
get them for 2,264 dollars.
I n 1790, July gth, a Mr. Simpson, of Gibraltar, who, a t some
particular request, had taken pains to find for what sum our captives
could be redeemed, h d s that the fourteen will cost 34,792.28 dollars,
which is 2,485 dollars a man. At the same date, one of them, a
Scotch boy, a common mariner, was actually redeemed at 8,000 livres,
equal to 1,481 dollars, which is within 19 dollars of the price Simpson
states for common men: and the charge des affaires of the United
States a t Paris is informed that the whole may be redeemed at that
rate, adding fifty per cent. on the captains, which would bring it to
1,571 dollars a mm.
I t is found then that the prices are 1,200, 1,237, 1,481, 1,546,
1,571, 1,600, 1,800, 2,137, 2,264, 2,485, 2,833, and 2,920 dollars a
man, not noticing that of 4,074 dollars, because i t was for s cap*.
In 1786, there were 2,200 captives in Algiers, which, in 1789, had
been reduced by death or ransom to 655. Of ours six have died, and
one has been I-ansomed by his friends.
From these facts and opinions, some conjecture may be formed of
the terms on which the liberty of our citizens may be obtained.
But should i t be thought better to repress force by force, another
expedient for their liberation may perhaps offer. Captures made on
the enemy may perhaps put us into ossession of some of their mariners,, and exchange be substituted or ransom. It is not indeed a
fixed usage with them to exchange prisoners. It is rather their

%

P

22

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1785 TO 1801

custom to refuse it. However, such exchanges are sometimes effected,
by allowing them more or less of advantage. They have sometimes
accepted of two Moors for a Christian, at others they have refused
five or six for one. Perhaps Turkish captives may be objects of
greater artiality with them, as their government is entirely in the
hands o Turks, who are treated in every instance as a superior order
of beings. Exchange, too, wiU be more practicable in our case, as
our captives have not been sold to private individuals, but are retamed
in the hands of the Government.
The liberation of our citizens has an intimate connexion with the
liberation of our commerce in the Mediterranean, now under the
consideration of Congress. The distresses of both proceed from the
same cause, and the measures which shall be adopted for the relief
of the one, may, very probably, involve the relief of the other.

[NDA. Am. State Papers, Foreign Rel., Vol. 1.1

[28 December 17901
Report of Secretary of State to the Congress of the United States
MEDITERRANEAN TRADE.

Report of the Secretay of State relative to the Mediterranean Trade.
Communicated to the House of Representatives, December SO, 1790,
and to the Senate, January 3, 1791.
The Secretary of State, to whom was referred by the House of
Representatives so much of the speech of the President of the United
States to both Houses of Congress, as relates to the trade of the United
States in the Mediterranean, with instructions to report thereupon to
the House, has had the same under consideration, and thereupon
makes the following report:
The loss of the records of the custom houses in several of the States,
which took place about the commencement and during the course of
the late war, has deprived us of official information as to the extent
of our commerce and navigation in the Mediterranean sea. According
to the best which may be obtained from other sources meriting respect,
i t may be concluded, that about one-sixth of the wheat and flour
exported from the United States, and about one-fourth in value of
their dried and pickled fish, and some rice, found their best markets
in the Mediterranean ports; that these articles constituted the principal part of what we sent into that sea; that, that commerce loaded
outwards, from eighty to one hundred ships, annually, of twenty
thousand tons, navigated by about twelve hundred seamen. It was
abandoned early in the war. And after the peace which ensued, it
was obvious to our merchants, that their adventures into that sea
would be exposed to the depredations of the piratical States on the
coast of Barbary. Congress, too, was very early attentive to this
danger, and by a commission of the 12th of May, 1784, authorized
certain persons, named ministers plenipotentiary for that purpose, to
conclude treaties of peace and amity with the Barbctry Powers. And
it b e ' i afterwards found more expedient that the negotiations should
be carried on a t the residences of those Powers, Congress, by a further
commission, bearing date the 11th of March, 1785, empowered the
same ministers plenipotentiary to appoint agents to repair to the said

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS

23

Powers a t their proper residences, and there to negotiate such treaties.
The whole expenses were limited to eighty thousand dollars. Agents
were accordingly sent to Morocco and Al 'ers.
Before the appointment of the one to h?orocco, i t was known that a
cruiser of that State had taken a vessel [*I of the United States; and
that the Emperor, on the friendly interposition of the court of Madrid,
had liberated the crew, and made restitution of the vessel and cargo,
as far as their condition admitted. This was a happy presage of the
liberal treaty he afterwards concluded with our agent, still under the
friendly mediation of Spain, and at an expense of between nine and
ten thousand dollars only. On his death, which has taken place not
long since, it becomes necessary, according to their usage, to obtain
immediately a recognition of the treaty by his successor, and wnsequently, to make provisions for the expenses which may attend it
The amount of the former furnishes one ground of estimate; but the
character and dispositions of the successor, which are unknown here,
may influence it materially. The friendship of this Power is important, because our Atlantic as well as Mediterranean trade is open to
his annoyance, and because we carry on a useful commerce with his
nation
The Algerines had also taken two vessels of the United States,
with twenty-one persons on board, whom they retained as slaves. On
the arrival of the agent sent to that regency, the Dey refused utterly
to treat of peace on any terms, and demanded 59,496 dollars for the
ransom of our captives. This mission therefore proved ineffectual.
While these negotiations were on foot at Morocco and Algiers, an
ambassador from Tripoli arrived in London. The ministers plenipotentiary of the United States met him in person. He demanded for
the peace of that State thirty thousand guineas; and undertook to
engage that of Tunis for a like sum. These demands were beyond
the limits of Congress and of reason, and nothing was done. Nor was
it of importance, as, Algiers remaining hostile, the peace of Tunis and
Tripoli was of no value; and when that of the former should be obtained, theirs would soon follow.
Our navigation, then, into the Mediterranean, has not been resumed
at all since the peace. The sole obstacle has been the unprovoked war
of Algiers; and the sole remedy must be to bring that war to an end,
or to paKiate its effects. Its effects may, perhaps, be palliated by
ensuring our ships and cargoes destined for that sea, and by forming
a convention with the regency, for the ransom of our seamen, according to a fixed tariff. That tariff will, probably, be high, and the rate
of ensurance so settled, in the long run, as to pay for the vessels and
cargoes captured, and somethmg more. What proportion will be captured, nothing but experience can determine. Our commerce differs
from that of most of the nations with whom the predatory States are
in habits of war. Theirs is spread all over the face of the Mediterranean, and therefore must be sought for all over its face. Ours must
all enter at a strait only five leagues wide; so that their cruisers, taking
a safe and commanding position near the strait's mouth, may very
effectually inspect whatever enters it. So safe n station, with a certainty of receiving for their prisoners a good and stated price, may
tempt their cupidity to seek ovr vessels particularly. Nor is it certain that our seamen could be rnduced to engage in that navigation,
though with the security of Algerine faith that they would be hber-

24

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1785 TO 1801

ated on the payment of a fixed sum. The temporary deprivation of
liberty, perhaps chains, the danger of the peat, the perils of the engagement preceding their surrender, and possible delays of the ransom,
might turn elsewhere the choice of men, to whom all the rest of the
world is open. In every case, these would be embarrassments which
would enter into the merchant's estimate, and endanger his preference of foreign bottoms not exposed to them. And upon the whole,
this expedient does not f a our wish of a complete re-establishment
of om commerce in that sea.
A second plan might be, to obtain peace by purchasing it. For this
we have the example of rich and powerful nations, in this instance
counting their interest more than their honor. If, conforming to their
example, we determine to purchase a peace, it is proper to inquire
what that peace may cost. This being merely a matter of conjecture,
we can only compare together such opinions as have been obtained,
and from them form one for ourselves.
Mr. Wolf, a respectable Irishman, who had resided very long a t
Algiers, thought a peace might be obtained from that regency, and
the redemption of our captives included, for sixty or sevenhjTthouswd
pounds sterling. His character and opinion both, merited respect.
Yet his estimate being the lowest of all who have h a z d e d an oplnion
on this subject, one is apt to fear his judgment might have been
biased by the hope he entertained that the United States would charge
him with this negotiation.
Captain O'Brien, one of our captives, who had been in Algiers four
yeam and a half a t the date of his last lettef, a very sensible man, and
to whom we me indebted for very minute mformation, supposes that
peace alone might be bought for tahat sum, that is to say, for three
hundred and twenty-two thousand dollars.
The Tripoline ambassador, before mentioned, thought that peace
could be made with the three smaller Powers for ninety thousand
pounds sterhg, to which were to be added the e enses of the mission and other incidental expenses. But he cou d not answer for
Algiers: They would demand more. The ministers plenipotentiary
who conferred with him, had judged that as much must be paid to
Algiers as to the other three Powers together; and consequently,
that, according to this measure, the peace of Algiers would cost from
an hmdred to an hundred and twenty-five thousand pounds sterling;
or from four hundred and sixty to five hundred and seventy-five
thousand dollars.
The latter sum seemed to meet the ideas of the Count de Vergennes,
who, from a very long residence a t Constantinople, was a good judge
of whatever related to the Porte, or its dependencies.
A person whoso name is not free to be mentioned here, a native of
the continent of Europe, who had long lived, and still lives a t Algiers,
with whom the minister plenipotentiary of the United States a t Paris
had many and long conversafiops, and found his information full,
clear, and consistent, was of opizuon the peace of Algiers could not be
bought by the United States for less than a million of dollars. And
when that is paid, dl is not done. On the death of a Dey (and the
present one is between seventy and ~ i g h t yyears of age) respeotable
presents must be made to the successor, that he may recognise the
treaty;. and very often he takes the Iiberty of alterin it. Whm a
co11~ul~ssent or changed, new presents must be made. f these eventa

7'

f

WARS WlTH BARBARY POWERS

25

leave a considerable internal, occasion must be made of renewing
presents. And with all this they must see that we are in condition to
chastise an infraction of the treaty; consequently, some marine force
must be exhibited in their harbor from time to time.
The late peace of Spain with Algiers is snid to have cost from three
to five millions of dollars. Having received the money, they take the
vessels of that nation on the most groundless pretexts; counting, that
the same force, which bowed Spain to so hard a treaty, may break
it with impunity.
Their treaty with France, which had expired, was about two years
ago renewed for fifty years. The sum given a t the time of renewal
is not known. But presents we to be repeated every ten yearn, and
a tribute of one hundred thousand dollars to be annually paid. Yet
perceiving that Prance, embarrassed at home with her domest.ic
affairs, was less capable of acting abroad, they took six vessels of that
nation in the course of the last year, and retain the captives, forty-four
in number, in slavery.
It is the opinion of Captain O'Brien, that those nations are best
treated who pay a smaller sum in the beginning, and an annual
tribute afterwards. In this way he informs us that the Dutch,
Danes, Swedes, and Venetians pay to Algiers from twenty-four to
thirty thousand dollars a year, each; the two first in naval stores,
the two last chiefly in money. It is supposed that the peace of the
Barbary States costs Great Britian about sixty thousand guineas, or
two hundred and eighty thousand dollars a, year. But i t must be
noted that these facts cannot be authentically advanced; as, from a
principle of self condemnation, the governments keep them from the
public eye as much as possible.
Nor must we omit finally to recollect, that the Algerines, attentive
to reserve always a sufficient aliment for their piracies, will never
extend their peace beyond certain limits, and consequently that we
may find ourselves in the case of those nations to whom they refuse
peace at any price.
The third expedient is to repel force by force. Several statements
are hereto annexed of the naval force of Algiers, taken in 1785, 1786,
1787, 1788, and 1789, differing in small degrees, but concurring in the
main. From these it results, that they have usually had about nine
chebecks of from ten to thirty-six guns, and four alleys, which have
been reduced by losses to six chebecks and four gaif eys. They have a
forty gun frigate on the stocks, and expect two cruisers from the Grand
Se' nior. The character of their vessels is, that they are sharp
b$t and swift, but so light as not to stand the broadside of a good
frigate. Their guns are of different calibres, unskilfully pointed and
worked. The vessels illy mapoeuaed, but crowded with men-one
third Turks, the rest Moors, of determined bravery, and resting their
sole hopes on boarding. But two of these vessels belong to the
government, the rest being private property. If they come out of
harbor together, they separate immediately in quest of prey; and it is
said they were never known to act together in any instance. Nor do
they come out at all, when they know there are vessels cruisin
them. They perform three cruises a year, between the middfe of
A p d and November, when they unrig and lay up for the winter.
When not confined within the straits, the rove northwardly to the
channel, and westwardly to the Western Is ands.

r'

26

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1786 TO 1801

They are in peace a t present with France, Spain, England, Venice,
the United Netherlands, Sweden, and Denmark; and at war with
Russia, Austria, Portugal, Naples, Sardinia, Genoa, and Malta.
Should the United Statas propose to vindicate their commerce by
arms, they would, perhaps, think i t prudent to posess a force equal
to the whole of that which may be opposed to them. What that equal
force would be, w i l l belong to another department to say.
At the same time it might never be necessary to draw out the whole
a t once, nor perhaps any proportion of it, but for a small part of the
year; as it is reasonable to presume that n concert of operation might
be arranged among the powers a t war with the Barbary States, so as
that, each performing a tour of a given duration, and in given order, a
constant cruise during the eight temperate months of every year, may
be kept up before the harbor of Algiers, till the object of such operations be completely obtained. Portugal has singly, for several years
past, kept up such a cruise before the straits of Gibraltar, and by
that means has confined the Algerines closely within. But two of
their vessels have been out of the straits in the last five years. Should
.Portugal effect a peace with them, as has been apprehended for some
time, the Atlantic will immediately become the principal scene of
their piracies; their peace with Spain having reduced the profits of
their Mediterranean cruises below the expenses of equipment.
Upon the whole, i t rests with Congress to decide between war,
tribute, and ransom, as the means of re-establishing our Mediterranean
commerce. If war, they will consider how far our own resources shall
be called forth, and how far they will enable the Executive to engage,
in the forms of the constitution, the co-operation of other Powers.
If tribute or ransom, it will rest with them to limit and provide the
amount; and with the Executive, obse~vingthe same constitutional
forms, to make arrangements for employing it t o the best advantage.

NAVAL OPEBATIONS FROM 1786 TO 1801
[Enclosure]

To the Congress of the United States from Richard O'Brien, Algiers

CITYOF ALGIERS,
April 28,1791.
MOSTHONORED
SIRS: I t affords the Americans in captivity some
consolation to hear that his excellency the President has drawn the
attention of Congress towards Barbary affairs, and to consider of the
decrease of American commerce to the Mediterranean.
One of your most unfortunate subjects takes the liberty of humbly
submitting to your consideration the following particulars on Barbary
affairs.
I n December last, the Philanthropic Society sent orders to Europe
to t for a peace with this regency; these orders came to Monsieur
~ a t ~ofnMarseilles,
,
who commissioned Monsieur Parnet, a French
merchant in Algiers, and agent for the chamber of commerce, Marseilles. Monsieur Parnet, made application to the Dey and ministry
on this important subject, but was not enabled to obtain any answer
of importance until the 18th of December, when he immediately
despatched a vessel for Marseilles. Monsieur Parnet was authorized
by his orders to treat for the ransom of the Americans; but as our
redemption had been ascertained the 7th of last July, by Abraham
Bushara and Dininio, for the sum of 17,225 Algerine sequins, nearly
equal to 34,450 Spanish dollars, Monsieur Parnet could only return
for answer, that our ransom was finally ascertained, and is so recorded
by the regency a t the above sum. Monsieur Parnet informed me
that his orders relative to the peace did not authorize him to make the
ministry any promises for them to use their influence with the Dey:
for if he made any promises, he must fulfil them, and by his not being
fully empowered, he could not take the proper channel for laying the
foundation of the peace, and that the Dey signified that, when the
Americans made good their agreement of the 7th last July, that then
he would consider of the peace.
I take the liberty, honored sirs, to observe, that there is no doing
any business of importance in this country, without Grst palming the
ministry; and by taking this proper channel, be assured, honored sirs,
that there is no great difficulty to carry any point.
I take the liberty of explaining that the Algerines had great reason
to think that the Americans considered them in a very singular light,
by sending orders, three different times, relative to ascertaining our
ransom and affairs that had been fixed on a few months past; then to
empower Monsieur Parnet, supposing the Algerines would lower their
rice, or deviate, in any respect, from the agreement made with
gushara and Dininio.
Be assured, honored sirs, that Monsieur Parnet found this to be a
very delicate subject to treat of, and by what I now hint to you,
honored sirs, your superior wisdom will perceive the impropriety of
an further propositions relative to ascertaining our ransom.
'$he prime minister sent to me, and desired that, when I wmte m
country, to write, that, if the Americans did not keep to their w o r z
on affairs so trifling as that of our release, that there was no great
dependence to be put in America, in affairs of more importance,
alluding to the peace. Be assured, honored sirs, that the prime
minister is a friend to America, and was the only one of the Algerine
ministry that countenanced Mr. Lamb, in 1786.

writing to Mr. James Simpson, a t Gibraltar, and Mr. Simpson, supposing the orders originated in Congress, wrote to Bushara and
Dininio, to have our redemption ascertained with the regency; so
that, if ever we are to be redeemed, i t must be through the channel
of Bushara and Dininio, as the Dey, in his answer to Monsieur Parnet,
signified fully as much, snd as they are Algerine subjects, the Dey and
ministry of course will determine the affair in their favor.
At present there are but 700 Christian slaves in Algiers, and the
two-thirds of these are deserters from the Spanish garrison of Oran ;
and as the captives are much wanted to do the public work, the
regency does not seem inclinable to permit slaves to be redeemed on
any terms: for without the slaves, those people could not well fit out
their cruisers.
I n 1786, there were three thousand Christian slaves in Algiers; but
the Spaniards, Neapolitans, and other nations redeeming thew people,
and the pest, that great storm of mortality, which happened m this
city in 1787-8, which carried off nine hundred Christian captives amongst this number were six Americans - our redemption is but
trifling higher than the terms on which the Spaniards and other nations
redeemed their people, and, since those redemptions and the pest, the
price of slaves is continually rising.
Those lads that are pages to the Dey, were solicited to turn Mahometans, but they would not, which makes their prices somewhat exorbitant.
When I consider the fatal consequences that would happen to
America, if the Portuguese should make a peace with this regency,
i t makes the greatest impression on me of any thing whatsoever that
can possibly occur to a patriotic mind; and although at present the
Portuguese keep up a fleet of cruisers to protect their own commerce,
yet experience shews (by Spain) that t.hey may be negotiating a
peace underhand.
Since my captivity, the Portuguese have made two attempts to
try to obtain a peace, and fortunate (thank God) for America they
did not succeed. Should they succeed, America would be put to a
vast expense to build and fit out eight or ten cruisers; and to keep this
squadron in Europe for a few years, would he attended with a vast
expense, which Ainerica could not vell afford. Should the Portuguese make a pence, and America to abandon the Straits to the
Algerines, the alarm would be so great that no American property
would be ensured under twenty-five percent. The first cruise, they
would go as far as the Western Islands, and, by being acquamted with
the navigation that far, would be induced to go on to the coasts of
America; then, honored sirs, what would be the fatal consequences what would be the alarm! and it is well known that there is nothing
to be derived by being a t war with the Barbary States; but, by being
at peace, many adt-antages, and extended and beneficial commerce.
I t has cost Spain full four and a half millions 01 dollars to make
their eace, and redeem their people, notwithstanding Spnin acted
somet ing wisely not to be the dupe of all the commercial nations of
Europe.
Honored sirs, in my opinion, the United States may obtain a peace
with this regency for tiity or sixty thousand pounds sterling, all
expenses included; that is, if the affair is well managed; and with

Tunis for fifteen thousand pounds sterlin . I n making a peace with

is a tribut
State to t b regency, and under its influence.
Instead o America giving a sum of money for the peace, I believe
this regency would find it to their interest to take, in lieu, maritme
dares, masts, yards, plank, tar, pitch, turpentine, scantling, for
constructing crmsers; and, by giving maritime stores, I believe the
peace would not cost America twenty thousand pounds sterling.
Or to purchase one hundred and fifty or two hundred passports of
the regency, at a certain fixed price, and tor these, to pay a certain
sum every two years, and those that wanted those passports, that
traded to Europe, to purchase them of the Government, so that the
passports would defray the expenses incurred in obtaining the peace.
I have frequently, these four years, had some hints of these subjects
communicated to the Algerine ministry, and ha.d favorable answers
which I wrote to the American ambassadors in Europe.
The present time is favorable for America to try for the peace;
and I further take the liberty, honored sirs, to observe, that those
nations, the Dutch, Danes, Swedes, and Venetians, that pay a tribute
annually, that their peace is on a more solid and lasting basis than
those nations that give large sums for making the peace, and not to be
tributary: for i t is the annual tribute those nations pay the Algemes
is the bait that secures their peace, and not any sentiment of national
honor or regard to treaties, but for their own interest in being supplied
with naval and military stores.
Most honored sirs, we hope you will consider what our sufferings
must have been in this country, during that trying period of nearly
six years captivity; but we now hope that you wiU give such powers
to your representatives in Europe, so as to finally extricate your
fourteen unfortunate subjects from their present state of bondage
and adversity.

SIR YOUare appointed by the President of the United States to
go to the Court of Morocco for the purpose of obtaining from the new
emperor a recognition of our Treaty with his father. As it is thought
best that you should go in some definite character, that of Consul
has been adopted, and you consequently receive a Commission as
Consul for the United States in the dominions of the Emperor of
Morocco, which having been issued during the recess of the Senate
will of course expire a t the end of their next Session. I t has been
thought best however not to insert this limitation in the Commission
5s being unnecessary, and i t might perhaps embarrass. Before the
end of the next Session of the Senate it is expected the objects of your
mission will be accomplished.
Lisbon b e i i the most convenient port of correspondence between
us and Morocco, sufficientauthority will be given to Col. Humphreys,
Resident for the United States at that place, over funds in Amsterdam
for the objects of our mission. On him therefore ou will draw for
the sums herein adowed, or such parts of them as s aU be neceastq.
To that port too you had better proceed in the first vessel which shall

thence to Morocco.
On your asrival in Morocco sound your ground, and know how
things stand at present. Your former voyage there having put you
in possession of the characters through whom this may be done, who
may best be used for approaching the Emperor and effecting your
purpose, you are left to use your own knowledge to the best advantage.
The object being merely to obtain an acknowledgment of the
treaty, we rely that you will be able to do this, giving very moderate
presents. As the amount of these will be drawn into precedent on
future similar repetitions of them, it becomes important. Our distance, our seclusion from the ancient world, it's politics and usages,
our agricultural occupations and habits, our poverty, and lastly our
determination to prefer war in all cases to tribute under any form and
to any people whatever, will furnish you with topics for opposing
and refusing high or dishonoring pretentions, to which may be added
the advantages their people will derive from our commerce, and their
Sovereign from the duties laid on whatever we extract from that

writing by every possible occasion, detailing to us particularly your
conferences either private or public, and the persons with whom they
are held.
We think that Francisco Chiappe has merited well of the United
States by his care of their peace and interests. He has sent an account of disbursements for us amounting to 394 dollars. Do not
recognize the account, because we are unwilling, by doing thrat,to
give him a colour for presenting larger ones hereafter, for expenses
which it is impossible for us to scrutinize or controul. Let him
understand that o w laws oppose the application of public money so
informally; but in your presents, treat him handsomely, so as not
only to cover this demand, but go beyond it with a liberality which
may fix him deeply in our interests. The place he holds near the
Emperor renders his friendship peculiarly important: Let us have
nothing further to do with his brothers or any other person. The
money which would make one good friend, divided among several will
produce no attachment.
The Emperor has intimated that he expects an Ambassador from
us. Let h m understand that this may be a custom of the old world,
but it is not ours: that we never sent an Ambassador to any nation.
You are to be allowed from the day of your departure till your
return 166% dollars a month for your time and expenses, adding
thereto your passage money and sea stores going and coming.

succeeded by M i Hassan who after having ordered the Aga to be

Congress for being Merchant I could go over as such and on the perticu1ar business of my house for which I can easily get permission from
the Dey and be well received by Soliman, they both already know my
hearty desire to bring about a Concdliation and this would naturaly
be our topic of Conversation; I should then let him know that the
few slaves they have of ours were picked up by accident when they
apprehended no danger but that they must expect no more now we
are on our guard, and that the profits tbey can have in continuing a
war like this can never be equal to the solid advantages the must
reap from making a peace with us on such terms as we cod afford
besides that I know his Excellency wishes to do me service he could
never have so good an opportunity as the present by enabling me to
have the honour of bringing about a peace between him and the
United States: This language and what else your Excellency might
think more proper to advise I should make use of to him and as he
understands Spanish very well I should not require. an Interpreter,
which might make him less cautious to develope his rmnd to me on the
business As no Nation has been able to make peace with this Regency without paying for it in some manner or other we of courso need not expect
to do i t for Nothing but it may be done in the manner the [United]
States will suffer least by it; some armed Vessels for Corsairs and such
Naval stores as are the produce of America would I dont doubt be
made to do; but a visit to Algiers will be necessary before anything can
be said on the business with certint at which time our prisioners there
could also be thought of - Sho d your Excellency approve of m y
part of what has struck me on this important business and honour me
with your Confidence I should immediately go to Algiers and purchass
some wheat for this market, when I should have an opportunity of
informing my self pretty fully without discovering any such intention
after which I shall comunicate such advices as may be laid before
Congress and if in the business you chuse to correspond in cyphers a

Russian war is ended; the seige of Oran continues with very little

America.

-

Sometime before the Death of the Late Emperor, which happened
on the 11" of April 1790, his Son Muley Yezid took refuge in a Sanctuary near Tetuan, t o avoid the resentment of his father, who ordered
Muley Slama a younger Son by the Same Mother to invest the
Sanctuary, which he was afraid to violate in a more direct manner,
So as to Cut off all communication between it and the Camtry, and
consequently in the end compel Muley Yezid from the want of Subsistance to Surrender himself to his father, before this could be
effected, the Emperor died at Saffy, and the Prince quitted the
Sanctuary having been proclaimed his Successor in the North, as well
as in the Cities of Fez, Mequinez, and Morocco, while Muley Slema,
by one of these changes of fortune not uncommon in his Country, to
escape the power of his brother, placed himself in the Sanctuary
where he Still remains. The new Emperor, who has sssumed the name of Mabomet El
Mehedy El Yezid has had pressing Solicitations to appear at the great

Petition of Prisoners at Algiers

The Petition of the Prisoners st &em, Sheweth That we were Captured nearly Seven Years ago b Cruisers belonging to the Regency of Algiers, while we were avigating Vessels
belonging to Citizens of the United States. That we were for a Considerable time flattered with the expectation held u to us that we
would be redeemed from Captivity, as soon as it Co d be done Consistant with propriety, and the mterest of our Country. That to
Effect this Redemption M' John Lamb was sent to Algiers on the
part of the United States, and that he entered into an agreement with
the Regency at Algiers for our ransom, in consequence of which, the
terms were recorded on the Books of the Regency, But M' Lamb
never returned to fulfill them by the payment of the Ransom Money,
though he promised in the Name of the United States to do it in four
Months. That we understand severd persons have since been employed to make inquiries whether the Ransom agreed upon by Mr
Lamb, might not be reduced, but all attempts of that sort have hitherto proved inefectud, the Regency declaring that the Contract made
by the Agent on the part of the United States ought to be discharged That we were for some time supplied with such sums of Money as
served, together with the prospect of Redemption held up to us, to
alleviate in some degree the rigor of our Captivity, but those supplies
have Ceased for a Considerable time, during which we have been
reduced to the Utmost distress, and we are Compelled in a great
Measure to depend on the Charity of Transient people That owing to the Meioncholy situation to which we are reduced,
one of us, James Hormet, has been deprived of his senses, and Confined in a Dungeon, the rest remain destitute almost of all the necessaries of lfe, and in this Deplorable situation we have resisted any
temptations to Enter into the service of the Regency, that might
hereafter be attended with Repentance or Remorse, trusting in the
Justice and Humanity of Congress that we shall never be reduced to
the Necessity of abandoning our Country and our Religion Your Most humble petrtioners further pray you will Consider
what our sufferings must have been for Nearly seven Years Captivity,

To Admiral JOHN
PAUL
JONES.

PHILADELPHIA
June 1. 1792'.

SIR The President of the United States having thought proper

to appoint you Commissioner for treating with the Dey and Govern-

ment of Algiers on the subjects of Peace and ransom of our captives,
I have the honor to enclose you the Commissions, of which Mr Thomas
Pinckney now on his way to London as our Minister Plenipotentiary
there, d l be the bearer. Supposing that there exists a disposition
to thwart our negotiations with the algerines, and that this would
be very practicable, we have thought i t adviseable that the knowledge of this appointment should rest with the President, Mr Pinckney
and myself: for which reason you will perceive that the Commissions
are all in my own hand writing. for tho same reason, entire secrecy
is recommended to you, and that you so cover from the public your
departure and destination, as that they may not be conjectured or
noticed; and at the same time that you set out after as short delay as
your affairs will possibly permit.
In order to enable you to enter on this business -4th full information, it will be necessary to give you a history of what has passed.
On the 25. July 1785. the Schooner Maria,Captn Stevens, belonging to a Mr Foster of Boston, was taken off Cape St Vincents by an
Algerine Cruiser; and five days afterwards, the Ship Dauphin, Capt?
Obrian, belonging to MessTs Irvins of Philadelphia was taken by
another about 50. Ieagues westward of Lisbon. These vessels with
their cargoes and crews, twenty one persons in number, were carried
into Algiers. M' John Lamb, a pointed Agent for treating of peace
between the United States an$ the Government of Ahgem, was
ready to set out from France on that business, when M' Adams and
myself heard of these two captures. The ransom of prisoners, being
a case not existing when our powers were prepared, no provision had
been made for it. We thought however we ought to endeavor to
ransom our countrymen, without waiting for orders; but at the same
time, that, acting without authority, we should keep within the
lowest price which had been given by any other Nation. We therefore gave a supplementory instruction to M' Lamb to ransom our
captives, if it could be done for 200. dollars a man, as we knew that
three hundred French captives had been just ransomed by the
Mathurins, at a price very little above this sum. E e proceeded to
Algiers: but his mission proved fruitless. He wrote us word from
thence, that the Dey asked 59.496. dollars for the 21 captives, and that

WARS WITI1 BAHL'ARY POWERS
it was not probable he would abate much from that price: but he never
intimated an idea of agreeing to give it. As he has never settled the
accounts of his mission, no further information has been received.
I t has been said that he entered into a positive stipulation with the
Dey to pay for the prisoners the price above mentioned, or something near it; and that he came away with an assurance to return
with the money. We cannot believe the fact true; and if i t were,
we disavow i t totally, as far beyond his powers. We have never
disavowed it formally, because it has never come to our knowledge
with any degree of certainty.
I n Peb? 1787. I wrote to Congress to ask leave to employ the
Mathurins of France in ransoming our captives, and on the 19. of
Septem' I received their orders to do so, and to call for the money
from our bankers at Amsterdam as soon as it could be furnished. I t
was long before they could furnish the money, and, as soon as they
notified that they could, the business was put into train by the
General of the Mathurins, not with the appearance of acting for the
United States or with their knowledge, but merely on the usual
ground of charity. This expedient was rendered abortive by the
Revolution of France, the derangement of ecclesiastical orders there,
and the revocation of church property, before any proposition perhaps
had been made in form by the Mathurins to the Dey of Algiers. _
I have some reason to believe that Mr Eustace, while in Spain
endeavored to engage the Court of Spain to employ their Mathurins
in this same business, but whether they actually moved in it, or not,
I have never learned
We have also been told that a M': S i p s o n of Gibraltar, by the
direction of the Mess~"ulke1eys of Lisbon, contracted for the ransom
of our prisoners (then reduced by death and ransom to 14) a t 34,792
28/38 dollars. By whose orders they did it we could never learn.
I have suspected it was some association in London, which finding
the prices far above their conception, did not go through with their
purpose, which probably had been merely a philanthropic one: be
this as i t may, i t was without our authority or knowledge.
Again, Mr Cathalan, our Consul a t Marseilles, without any instruction from the Government, and actuated merely, as we presume,
by a willingness to do something agreeable, set on foot another
negociation for their redemption; which ended in nothing.
These several volunteer interferences, though undertaken with
good intentions, run directly counter to our plan; which was to apold
the appearance of any purpose on our part ever to ransom our caphves,
and by that semblance of neglect, to reduce the demands of the algerines to such a price as might make it hereafter less their interest to
pursue our Citmens than any others. On the contrary they have
supposed all these propositions, directly or indirectly, came from us:
they inferred from thence the greatest anxiety on our part, where we
had been endeavoring to make them suppose there was none; kept
up their demands for our captives at the highest prices ever paid
by any Nation; and thus these charitable, though unauthorized
interpositions, have had the double effect of lengthening the chains
they were meant to break, and of making us at last set a much higher
rate of ransom, for our Citizens present and future, than we probably
should have obtained, if we had been left alone to do our own work,
in our own way. Thus stands this business then a t present. A

33

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1785 TO 1801

f o m d bmgain, as I am informed, being registered in the books of the
former Dey, on the part of the Bulkeleys of Lisbon, which the
Buppose to be obhgatarg on us, but which is to be utterly disavowed:
as having never been authorized by us, nor its source even known to us.
In 1790. this subject was laid before Congress fully, and a t the late
Session monies have been provided, and authority given to proceed
to the ransom of our captive Citizens at Algiers, provided it shall not
exceed a given sum, and pro$ded also a peace shall be previously
negotiated within certain b u t s of expense. And in consequence of
these proceedings your mission has been decided on by the President.
Since then no ransom is to take place without a peace, you will of
course take up first the negotiation of peace, or if you find ~t better
that peace and ransom should be treated of together, you will take
care that no agreement for the latter be concluded, unless the former
be established befoye, or .in the same instant.
As to the condit~ons,it is understood that no peace can be made
with that Government but for a larger sum of money to be paid at
once for the whole time of its duration, or for a smaller one to be
annually paid. The former plan we entireIy refuse, and adopt the
latter. We have also understood that peace might be bought cheaper
with naval stores than with money: but we will not furnish them naval
stores, because we think it not right to furnish them means which we
know they will employ to do wrong, and because there might be no
economy in it, as to ourselves in the end, as it would increase the
expense of that coercion which we may in future be obliged to practice
towards them. The only question then is, what sum of money will
we agree to pay them annmUy for peace?
By a letter from CaptF Obrian, [dated 27 September 17911 a copy of
which you receive herewith, we have his opinion that a peace could be
purchased with money for Â£60,000 sterling, or with nu& stores for
100,000. dollars. An annual payment equivalent to the k t , would be
Â£3000. sterling, or 13,500. dollars, the interest of the sum in gross.
If we could obtain it for as small a sum as the second in money, the
annual payment e uivalent to it would be 5000. dollars. In an other
part of the same etter Capt? Obrian says "if maritime stores and
two light cruisers given and a tribute p a d in maritime stores every
two years amounting to 12,000. dollars in America", a peace can be
had. The p f t of stores and cruisers here supposed, converted into an
annual equvalent, may be stated at 9000. dollars, and adding to i t
half the biennial sum, would make 15,000. dollars to be annually paid.
You will of course use your best endeavors to get it a t the lowest sum
practicable, whereupon I shall only say, that we should be pleased with
10,000. dollars, contented with 15,000., think 20,000. a very hard
bargain, yet go as far as 25,000. if it be impossible to get it for less;
but not a copper further, this being fixed by law as the utmost limit:
these are meant as annual sums. If you can put off the first annual
payment to the end of the first year, you may
exceeding that in presents to be paid down: but
to be m d e in hand, that and the presents
25,000. dollars.
And here we meet a d%cult4y, arising from the small degree of information we have respecting the Barbary States. Tunis is said to be
tributary to Algiers; but whether the effect of this be that peace being
made with Algiers, is of course with the Tunisians without separate

I

W&S

treaty, or separate price, is what we know not. If i t be possible to
have it placed on this footing so much the better. At any event it will
be necessary to stipulate with Algiers that her influence be interposed
as strongly as possible with Tunis, whenever we shall proceed to treat
with the latter; which cannot be till information of the event of your
negotiation, and another Session of Congress.
As to the articles and form of the treaty in general, our treaty with
Marocco was so well digested that I enclose you a copy of that to be
the model with Algiers, as nearly as it can be obtained, only inserting
the clause with respect to Tunis.
The ransom of the captives is next to be considered. they are now
thirteen in number, to wit, Richard Obrian, and Isaac Stevens, Captains, Andrew Montgomery and Alexander Forsyth, Mates, Jacob
Tessanier, a French passenger, William Patterson, Philip Sloan,
Peleg Lorin, James Hull, James Cathcart, George Smith, John
Gregory, James Hermit, seamen. I t has been a fixed principle with
Congress to establish the rate of ransom of American Captives with
the Barbary states at as low a point as possible, that it may not be the
interest of those States to go in quest of our Citizens in preference to
those of other Countries. Had it not been for the danger it would
have brought on the residue of our seamen, by exciting the cupidity
of those rovers against them, our Citizens now in Algiers wouId have
been long ago redeemed without regard to price. The mere money
for this particular redemption neither has been, nor is an object with
any body here. I t is from the same regard to the safety of our seamen
at large that they have now restrained u s from any ransom unaccompanied with peace: this being secured, we are led to consent to terms
of ransom, to which otherwise our government would never have consented; that is to say, to the terms stated by Captq Obrian in the following passage of the same letter - "by giving the Minister of the
Marine (the present Deys favorite) the sum of 1,000. sequins. I
would stake my life that we would be ransomed for 13,000. sequins &
all expenses included". Extravagant as this sum is, we will, under the
secunty of peace in future, go so far; not doubting a t the same time
that you will obtain it as much lower as possible, and not indeed without a hope that a lower ransom will be practicable from the assurances
given us in other letters from CaptWbrian, that prices are likely to be
abated by the present Dey, and particularly with us, towards whom
he has been represented as well disposed. You will consider this sum
therefore, say 27,000. dollars, as your ultimate limit, including ransom,
duties, and gratifications of every kind.
As soon as the ransom is completed, you will be pleased to have the
captives well cloathed, and sent home at the expense of the United
States, with as much economy as will consist with their reasonable
comfort.
I t is thought best that Mc Pinckney, our minister at London should
be the confidential channel of communication between us. He is
enabled to answer your draughts for money within the limits before
expressed: and as this will be b redrawing on Amsterdam, you must
settle with him the number o days a f t e ~sight a t which your bills
shall be payable in London so as to give him time, in the mean while,
to draw the monev from Amsterdam.
We shall be anxious to know as soon and as often as possible, your
prospeats in these negociations. You will receive herewith a cypher

9

40

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 17'85 TO 1801

which will enable you to make them with safety. London and Lisbon
(where Col. Humphreys will forward my letters) will be the safest and
best ports of communication. I also enclose two seperate commissions
for the objects of peace and ransom. To these is added a commission
to you as Consul for the United States a t Algiers, on the possibility
that it might be useful for you to remain there till the ratification of
the treaties shall be returned from hence; though you are not to delay
till their return, the sending the Captives home, nor the necessary
payments of money within the limits before prescribed. Should you
be willing to remain there, even after the completion of tho business,
as Consul for the United States, you will be free to do so, giving me
notice, that no other nomination may be made. These Commiss~ons,
being issued during the recess of the Senate, are in force, by the
Constitution, only till the next Session of the Senate; but their renewal then is SO much a matter of course, and of necessity, that you
may consider that as certain, and proceed without interniption. I
have not mentioned this in the Commissions, because it is in all cases
surplusage, and because it might be difFicult of explanation to tbose
to whom you are addressed.
The allowance for d l your expenses and time (exclusive of the ransom, price of peace, duties, presents, maintenance and transportation
of the Captives) is a t the rate of 2000. dollars a year, to commence
from the day on which you shall set out for Algiers, from whatever
place you mag take your departure. The particular objects of peace
and ransom once out of toheway, the 2000. dollars annually are to go
in satisfaction of time, services, and expences of every kind, whether
you act as Consul or Commissioner.
As the duration of this peace cannot be counted on with certainty,
and we look forward to the necessity of coercion by cruises on their
coast, to be kept up during the whole of their cruising season, you will
be pleased to inform yourself, as minutely as possible, of every circumstance which may influence or guide us in undertaking and conducting such an operation, making your communications by safe
opportunities.
I must recommend to your particular notice Captg Obrian, one of
the Captives, from whom we have received a great deal of useful
information. The zeal which he has displayed under the trying circumstances of his present situation has been very distinguished, you
will find him intimately acquainted with the manner in which and
characters with whom business is to be done there, and perhaps he
may be an useful instrument to you, especially in the outset of your
undertaking, which will require the utmost caution, and the best
information. He will be able to give you the characters of the European Consuls there, tho' you will probably not think it prudent to
repose confidence in any of them.
Should you be able successfully to accomplish the objects of your
mission in time to convey notice of i t to us as early as.possible during
the next Session of Congressl which meets in the beginmug of November
and rises the 4. of March, i t would have a very pleasing effect.

J ~ n e11.1792.
SIR Congress having furnkhed me with means for procuring peace,
and ransomug our captiv? c~tizensfrom the government of Algiers,
I have thought it best, whde you are engaged at Marocco, to appoint
Admiral Jones to proceed to Algiers, and therefore have sent him s
Commission for establishing peace, another for the ransom of our
ca tives, and a third to act there as Consul for the United States, and
f u 8 in~tructionsare given in a letter from the Secretary of State to
him, of all which papers, Mr Pinckney, now proceeding to London as
our Minister Plenipotentiary there, is the bearer, as he is also of this
letter. It is sometime however since we have heard of Admiral Jones,
and as, in the event of any accident to him, it might occasion an
injurious delay, were the business t~ await new Commissions from
hence, I have thought i t best, in such an event, that Mr Pinckne
should forward to you all the papers addressed to admiral Jones, wit
this letter, signed by myself, giving you authority on receipt of those
papers to consider them as addressed to you,. and to proceed under
them in every respect as if your name stood m each of them in the
place of that of John Paul Jones. You will of course finish the business
of your mission to Mnsocco with all the dispatch practicable, and then
proceed to Algiers on that hereby confided to you, where this letter
with the Commissions addressed to Admiral Jones, and an explanation
of circumstances, will doubtless procure you credit as acting in the
name and on the behalf of the United States, and more especially when
you shall efficaciously prove your authority by the fact of making, on
the spot, the pa ents you shall stipulate. With full confidence in
the prudence a n g t e g r i t y with which you will fuliill the objects of the
present mission, I give to this letter the effect of a Commission and
full powers, by hereto subscribing my name this eleventh day of June
one thousand seven hundred and ninety two.

To CoI. DAVIDHUMPHREYG
SIR,The deaths of Admiral Paul Jones first, and afterwards of M?
Barclay, to whom the mission to Algiers explained in the enclosed
papers [letter dated June 1, 17921 was successively confided, have led
the President to desire you to undertake the execution of i t in person.
These papers, being copies of what had been delivered to them will
serve a0 your guide. But M' Barclay having been also charged with a
mission to Morocco, it will be necessary
- to -e v e-you some trouble with
respect to that also;
Mr Nathaniel Cutting. the Bearer hereof, is dispatched s~eciallv.
first to receive from Mc f i c h e y in London a'ny papers or infohatioh;
which his Agency in the Al erine Business may have enabled him to
communicate to you: He WI% then proceed to deliver the whole to you,
and accompany and aid you in the character of Secretary I t is thought necessary that you should, in the first instance settle
Mr Barclay's accounts respecting the Morocco mission, which will
probably render it necessary that ou should go to Gibralter. The
communications you have had wit Mr Barclay in this mission will

g

43

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS

assist you in your endeavours a t a settlement. You know the sum
received by M' Barclay on that account, and we wish as exact a statement as can be made of the manner in which it has been laid out, and
what part of it's proceeds are now on hand. You will be pleased to
make an Inventory of these proceeds now existing. If they or any
art of them can be used for the Algerine mission, we would have you
all means apply them to that use, debiting the Algerioe fund, and
crediting that of Morocco with the amount of such application. If
they cannot be so used, then dispose of the perishable articles to the
best advantage, and if you can sell those not perishable for what they
cost, do so, and what you cannot so sell, deposite in any safe place
under your own power. In this last stage of the Business return us an
exact account I"! of the specific articles remaining on hand for that
mission, and their value. 2"g of it's cash on hand. 3 d of any money
which may be due to or from Mr Barclay or any other person on account of this mission, and take measures for replacing the clear
balance of cash in the hands of Messr! W. & I. 'CVillinks and NichQ&
Jacob Van Staphorsts and Nubbard This matter being settled, you will be pleased to proceed on the
mission to Algiers. This you will do by the way of Madrid, if you
think any information you can get from Mr Carmichael, or any other
may be an equivalent for the trouble, expense and delay of the journey.
If not, proceed in whatever other way you please to Algiers Proper powers and Credentials for you addressed to that government
are herewith enclosed. - The Instructions first given to Admiral
Paul Jones are so full that no others need be added, except a qualification in one single article, to wit: Should that Government h a l l y
reject peace on the terms in money, to which you are authorized to go,
you may offer to make the first payments for peace and that for ransom
m nuvd stores, reserving the right to make the subsequent annual
payments in money You are to be allowed your travelling expences, your salary as
Minister Resident in Portugal going on. Those expences must be
debited to the Algerine Mission, and not carried into your ordinary
account as Resident. Mr Cutting is allowed one hundred Dollars a
month, and his expenses, which as soon as he joins you, will of course
be consolidated with yours. We have made choice of him as parhcuIarly qualified to aid under your direction in the matters of account,
with which he is well acquainted. He receives here an advance of
One thousand Dollars by a draught on our Bankers in Holland in whose
hands the fund is deposited. This and aJl other sums furnished him,
to be debited to the Algerine fund. I inclose you a letter to our Bankers giving you complete authority over these funds, which ou had
better send with your f i s t Draught, though I send a copy o it from
hence b another opportunity Tlis usiness belng done, you will be pleased to return to Lisbon,
and to keep yourself and us thereafter well informed of the transactions
in Morocco, and as soon as you shall find that the succession to that
Government is settled and stable so that we may know to whom a
Commissioner may be addressed, be so good as to give us the information that we may take measures in consequence.

NAVAL OPEBATIONS FROM 1785 TO 1801
To Secretary of State from James Simpson, U. S. Consul, Gibraltar

GIBRALTAR
Is! June 1793 SIR: Contrary Winds having detain'd the Vessel this goes by,
affords me an opportunity of adding to my advices under 224 last
Month, forwarded by same conveyance, the intelligence we have
since received of the American Schooner Lark Captc Pulling from
Carthagena, having been captured off Cape de Gat, by an Algerine
Row Boat; - fortunately the Master & Crew escap'd in their Boat,
and landed in Spain. By our latest advices Muley Soliman remained a t Rhabat - most
of the Provinces sent him deputies, and he has been encouraged to
send part of his Army forward to Shauia or Tremecena, in order to
give the Alcaydes Ben Assar & Bellaroni an opportunity of joining
him if they should be inclined to do so - those Men have for some
time back lived in a state of Independency, and not taken part with
any of the contending Princes When Spain supported Muley Ishem in opposition to Yazid &
Islema they had no communication with any other part of the Empire
but that under his dominion - permission has lately been given for
their Vessels to trade as before to all the Ports, and I have it from the
best authority that the Court of Madrid will be one of the first to
send an Ambassador to Soliman, so soon as he can establish himself in
Morrocco.
The report of the Toulon Fleet having sailed has not been confirmed. The allied Army has enter'd France - by our latest advices they
were before Cond6 and Valenciennes. [SDA. CL, Gihmltar, Vol. I, April 1791-Dec. 1795.1

LISBON224 Septr 1793
SIR Col1 Humphreys with M Cutting embarked the 17" Inst: on
bg a Swedish Vessel called yVostillion commanded by Ab* Herbst
bound first for Gibralter. - The Algerine Corsairs are (unfortunately for us) more at Liberty just at this time than heretofore, the
Portugueze Ships of War, which were stationed on that Coast, being
obliged to quit it, to follow the orders of their Masters the English;
it is therefore to be feared that this circumstance may increase the
dBculties of the proposed negotiation, as the Algerines only wanted
this obstacle removed to have become Masters long ere this of many
of our Vessels and fellow-Citizens - Coll H. has probably informed
you that an American Vessel was taken by the Aulgerines the 18tP
UltQ& that the Men fortunately escaped in thee boat to the opposite
Shore near Malaga, had the men been taken, it E more than probable
that the great object in view would have been defeated, the Algerines
were in an American Vessel which they had taken some time before
and armed for the purpose, the Crew of this Vessel had also effected
their escape in the same way. - An American Vessel from Boston
sailed from this Port last Week bound for Malaga, it is of the utmost
importance that She also she escape, for should one other American
Crew fall into the Dey's hands, our Friend's means would be totally
inade uate, & his mission of c o v e fruitless. Un er the most favourable c~rcumstance.~,
with his present means,
We have no great reason to be very sangme of his success - The

1

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS
extreme ignorance and imprudent conduct of one of the precursors on
the same errand, have great1 magnified the expectations and demands of the Dey, and the tri ute paid by other Nations far exceeds
the Sum prescribed by the U. S. - Fortunately for America She
has every thing possible to hope from the present Agent, who goes
with a heart tremblingly alive to the Sufferings of the unfortunate
Captives, and who also possesses every other reqmsite conducive to
the success of such an Enterprize; but when we consider that he has
to treat with a rapacious Despot who is probably actuated solely by
self-interest, and restrained only by fear, that it is palpably for the
interest of all the European maritime Nations that We should be
excluded from a share m the mediterranean trade, and therefore
that all the Barbary Powers should be our Enemies; I would hope,
whatever may be the issue of this negociation, that my Countrymen
will give Col! Humphreys all the credit due to a Man who has done all
that Man can do. - No man is more thoroughly convinced than I
am of the importance,.and vast c o ~ e r c ~advantages
al
to the U. S.
of Amy of a free Mechterranean Navigation, but I am by no means
convinced that these advantages can possibly be secured to Us in our
present Situation; the faith of Puates - whose only support is plunder,
and who have hitherto contemned all those times and obligations
which clash wth their interest, and we sometimes bind more civilized
Despots, - seems to me to be but a feeble dependence on which to
place a large Stake.
When wc can appear in the Ports of the various Powers, or on the
Coast, of Barbary, with Ships of such force as to convince those
nations that We are able to protect our trade, and to compel them if
necessary to keep faith with Us, then, and not before, We may probably secure a large share of the Medit-rade, which would largely
and speedily compensate the U. S. for the Cost of a maritime force
amply sufficient to keep all those Pirates in Awe, and also make it
their interest to keep faith. We are here almost as ignorant of what the belligerent Powers are
doing as if We were in the moon, being excluded from all communication with France, and having only the garbled accounts in the London
papers, calculated in general to tickle the Ears, and drain the pockets
of that duped, and almost mimd Nation. This Nation seems in general extremely averse to engaging in the
War, both Nobles & People, but the Prince Regent is said to be under
the absolute guidance and controul of one Man, Martin de Mello,
who is the Creature and Idolator of the English - 6000 Troops are
just embarked to join the Spanish Army, and the Portug?~have some
time since furnished their Quota of Ships to the English, but it seems
the French still consider this nation as not involved in the War
against them, as .a Portugueze Ship is lately arrived from Bayonne in
France laden with pitch, tar, and paper - All the portugueze
vessels lately arrived, as well as many tl;mericans, complain bitterly
of the insults and pillage of the british privateers which they meet at
Sea, and of the pobteness of thefrench - but it is probably more wise
and prudent for both, to pocket the abuses a t present, than to resent
them. * * *

SIR Yesterday ye l l t p I rec* the following note from Coll Humphreys, our Minister Resident at this Court, but now at Gibraltar.
"DEARSIR" "We have advice of a Truce between the Portuguese
"and Algerines, and that an Algerine Fleet has gone into the Atlantic,
"Pray forward the inclosed with the intelhgence and believe me"
Your's
(Signed) D. HUMPHREYS
Immediately on receipt of this very alarming news, I called together
all the American Captains now in this Port, and communicated the
Contents of the above Letter, with such farther information as I had
a few minutes after obtained from a friendly and always well informed
Portuguese Gentleman - which was, that on the 5t@ instant an
Algerine Fleet consisting of eight armed Ships had been seen by a
Portuguese Frigate (just arrived) sailing out of the Mediterranem,
there were 4 Ships carrying 44,36,30, & 28 Guns - 3 Xebecs 20,24 &
26 Guns and one Brig of 22 Guns,
Their Signals to the Portuguese & English are said to be an English
Jack at the fore-top-gallant-Mast-head, and a Flag with blue and
white, or blue & Yellow stripes, at the Main top gallant mast head. Early this Morning I waited on his Excellency Luiz Pinto de Sousa
Minister & Secretary of State for foreign Affairs, on the subject of
in which i t had
this unexpected Event, and the unfortunate sit~at~ion
placed not only the American Ca tmnow here, but our Nation at large,
whose injury seems to have teen particularly meditated in this
nepociation: The Minister received me with great politeness, and anticipating
the cause of my visit, informed me that he was a t the moment of my
arrival occupied in writing to me on the subject, but was better
pleased to see me, as he could more fully and particularly explam the
nature of this business to me viva voce, than b letter, and assured
me that he would candidly communicate to me ow far the Court of
Portugal were concerned, or chargeable for the Mischiefs resulting from

g

48

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1786 TO 1801

this Truce, to all other Powers not at peace with Blgeirs, he declared
that it was as unexpected to the Court of Portugual as it could be to

us, and if it was not quite so unwelcome, yet it was by no means
agreeable to their Court, who never intended to conclude either a
Peace or Truce with the Dey without giving timely notice to all their
friends that they might avoid the dangers, to which they might otherwise be exposed by trusting to the Protection of the Portuguese Ships
of War stationed in the Mediterranean, - He acknowledged that
the Court of Portugal had about 6 Months past, expressed to the
Courts of England and Spain, a desire of their friendly cooperation to
induce a disposition in the Dey towards the establishment of a firm
and lasting peace with her most faithful Majesty, but having appointed
no Person directly or indirectly to negotiate in behau of her Majesty
they considered the business as only in embryo; but the british Court
zealous over much for the happiness of the two nations Portugal and
Algeirs, in order to precipitate this important business, very officiously
authorized Charles Logie the british Consul-General and Agent a t
Algiers, not only to treat, but to conclude, for and in behalf of this
Court,notonlywithout any Authority, butwithoutevenconsultingit ;A Truce was accordingly concluded between the Dey, and the british
Agent (for twelve Months) in behalf of her most faithful Majesty, for
the performance of which on the part of her Majesty the
British Court is Guarantee - the Condition is, that this Court shall
pay to the Dey one third as much as he receives, annually from the
court of Spain, - When this Court received information of this
proposed Condition from hl':Walpole the british Envoy to this Court;
They informed him, that however desirous they might be of a Peace
with Algiers, they were so far from being disposed to submit to such a
condition, that it was the determination of her most faithful Majesty
not to pay one farthing, but in the interval the Truce was signed by the
self constituted Agent Mr Logie, - The Minister Mr Pinto farther
informed me that this Court had ordered an Augmentation of their
Number of Armed Ships on the Mediterranean Station, so little mas
their expectation of a Truce or Peace with Algiers, and intimated that
the Algerines would probably ere long be less at liberty to cruise than
at present, and mentioned less than a Month but though I have great
confidence in his sincerity, and in the good wishes and disposition
towards us of many of the Portuguese Nobility, and of their sincere
hatred of the Enghsh, yet the Prince is young, weak, and obstinate,
and can, and probably mill determine as his own Caprice or Martin
de Mello may direct, - The Conduct of the british in this business
leaves no room to doubt, or mistake their object, which was evidently
aimed at Us, and proves that their envy, jealousy, and hatred, will never
be appeased, and that they will leave nothing unattempted to effect
our ruin, - as a farther confirmation it is worthy of remark, that the
same british Agent obtained a Truce at the same time between the
States of Holland and the Dey, for Six Months, whereby We and the
Eanse towns are now left the only prey to those Barbarians, - This
last Truce has in all probability cost the English very dear] as the
Algerines had profited much by Captures from the Dutch, slnce the
commencement of the late hostilities between the two Nations, This will I fear give a fatal Stroke to the advantages which we
might otherwise have derived from our Neutrality. -

I am a t this place interrupted by intelligence from A staunch friend
to America, who has information from the fountain head -it has
greatly shocked me -I have reason to fear that there is an infernal
combination in Europe against Us, France excepted, - and that we
have no other hope or resource but in our own Strength. Monday 14" I have just received a letter from Gibraltar of the 8'?
with orders to charter a Vessel to carry the intelligence to you Copy
of which letter I send herewith - At this moment a Sweedish Vessel
axrives - on the 94'' in Lat: 38. 13, She was boarded by an Algerine
Frigate, a t a small distance She saw another, which had just Captured 4 Americans, 2 Brigs, 1 Ship & 1 Schooner, - and one Genoese
ship She was informed of the Truce, and that it was for 12 Months with
Holland & Portugal - I have forwarded letters by Express wherever
I thought it necessary to notify our Citizens of their Danger, - We
are betrayed and many, many of our Countrymen will fall into the
Snare, - I send you a list of those in this port, - I have chartered
a Ship this Moment for Â£800 Sterle to carry my Dispatches, She sails
tomorrow - they will be delivered to you by Mr Livingston to whom
refer you for farther particulars, which In my great hurry I may omit;
I have not slept since Receipt of the news of this h e h h plot, - pardon
me for such Expressions - Another Corsair is in the Atlantic, God preserve Us, - News is just arrived P Post, that the French
have retaken Toulon - have repulsed the Duke of Brunswick with
great Slaughter; and that the Prince de Cobourg is in great Danger
of a total defeat, being hemmed in by a very powerful Army, whch
he dares not attack, Cetera desunt, - I have chartered the Vessel to
go, and return with a Cargo of wheat, or Flour to this Port or Cadiz,
for $800 Stlf, her freight back will go far to pay the Expence of her
hire - - God grant her a safe and speedy passage - Small hopes
now of a peace with Algiers - I t is currently reported here, that 3
or 4 some say 2 & some but 1 of the Algerine Frigates now cruising
against Us, were a late present from the british King, but for this I
have no other Authority than common report; if it should be thought
I have chartered the Vessel at a high price, I wish the Governmr to
be informed that all the protected Ships demand at least double since
the confirmation of this Algerine News, and I have been rather
favoured in the Contract which I have made, and therefore, hope no
blame will fall on me, but that I shall be enabled by the Government
to fulfill my Engagement, Upon farther e n q u q I am sorry to inform you that the letter cont a h g the above french News, comes from doubtful Authority. - I t
is a matter of certainty, which I have received from undoubted
Authority, though contradicted by the Minister Luiz Pinto, and at
present a great Secret, that one of the present Portg:" Ministers is in
this execrable plot, a plot loudly and publickly execrated by this
Nation - I asked if i t wns Martinio de Mello? and was answered
that all his consequence & his pecuniary Resources were derived from
the Meditefl fleet, or Algerine War, and of course no suspicion could
justly fall upon him - Was it the Secretary Luiz Pinto? my Informant only knew at present that one of the four Ministers had been
p r i z to the whole transaction, but could not fix it, but could and
wo d tell me very soon, at present he seemed disposed rather to suspect the first Minister, the Marquis Ponte-de-Lima, because he was

the inveterate Enemy of Martinho de Mello, whom my Author heard
say on a former occasion to An Ambassador on his taking leave of the
Court to go to Algiers to Negociate a peace, Sir! the Ships attend you,
you will therefore proceed without delay on your Embassy, but
remember what I have said, and what I now repeat, as of the greatest
consequence (meaning to himself) if you succeed in making a peace
you will do well, but if you should not succeed you will do much
better - the relation of these circumstances tho' trivial in themselves, may possibly enable ou to form a more adequate idea of this
Court than I should be ab e otherwise to give you, i t is with this
view I trouble ou with them, One of the rigates now Cruising under Algerine Colours was a
present from the King of Spain but not very lately - and one is
certainly a very late present from the british King - I write in
great haste, and perturbation of mind, yet hope and believe I have
omitted nothing in my power to communicate for the public good &
Safety, to promote which, I pray you to believe me ever most firmly
and sincerely devoted - If by the harshness of some of my expressions I should appear to ou to be more strongly prejudiced against
the british, or british po iticlrs, than my Countrymen in general, I
trust it is only because I know them better; Few of my Countrymen
having been so much conversant with them for 30 years last past,
the Interval of the late War excepted, and Fewer perhaps have observed & Studied them so much, I am convinced they were making
large Strides again in America, and would probably ere long have
possessed an influence there which sooner or later would have proved
our ruin, but Heaven I hope has timely interposed, and doomed them
to fall into the pit which they were digging for Us, and that great good
will ultimately be derived to Us from this great Evil, it is greatly to
be deplored that so many of our Citizens must be doomed to perpetual
Slavery, but better so, than the whole Nation, of which there seemed
to be not a little danger. I keep this letter open to make such additions as occasions may
offer, 'till the moment the Vessel weighs Anchor, She has nothing to
do but to take in Water I send you by this opp? a large Packet of letters from Col! Humphrey~which doubtless contain the most important intelligence -

SIR I have the honour to transmit you by the Brig Fair Hebe

for Philad" a Copy of my Letter to you of yesterday
[referring toMr. Humphreys' circular of 8 October 17931 by the Two
Sisters' Cap' Sheffield. - both vessels go out together, which affords'
a better chance of the Dispatches reaching you which I have received
from Mr Humphreys', & of which a duplicate goes heremth. While I am writing there are two American vessels' beating in,
which I have advised of their danger; - they are within the reach of
our Guns. We labour under great difEculty on account of a ractice which
calls' loudly for redress. whatever English ships' of orce come into
this Bay strip all American Vessels of their Men, the Natives of that
Kingdom they take out of them by main force, tho' these always'
enter as American Citizens', & Swear themselves to be Such, & the
Americans they use every endeavour to entice away. - There is
now here an English Frigate, the Adomache CapWones, which has
hardly left two Men on board of any American Vessel, & we have the
mortification to see Cap' Sheffield threatend with being deprived of
3 of his, which if executed, he will not be able to get away. - 1.m
endeavouring to prevent it, but as there is no Person here.authonsed
to represent the American cause, there is no redress of grievances to
be obtain'd.
My exertions on these occasions' proceed not from Officiousness,
but from a sincere attachment to a Country in which I have reaided
upwards of 3 year's, & of which I became a Citizen, & shall ever consider myself as such tho' Establish'd here in Trade. - My House is
extensively connected in Business with the United States, & the
grievances which I complain of bear hard on it. The Dispatches with which you entrusted me in November 1791
for Mc Carmichael at Madrid were duly forwarded & received by
him. [SDA. CL, Cadiz, Vol. 1-1791-1805.1

SIR 011 Saturday the 19" Instant, the Vessels belonging to the
Hanseatic Towns were ordered to be in readiness to sail the 25" under
Convoy of Two Portugueze Frigates, ordered by her Majesty to
Convoy them to a certain Latitude. - One of the Articles of the
Truce with Algiers which was communicated to me on the 12t!'
Instt by Luiz Pinto the Minister for foreign Affairs, expressly restricted the Portugueze from affording protection (without exception)
to any one Nation, Nevertheless the Consul and Agent for the Hanseatic Towns, petitioned for a Convoy, apd strongly .Urged a right
founded on a prior Treaty of a very ancient date exlsting between
the two Nations, this was generally understood to be the principle
upon which the Convoy was granted, and was so publickly declared
by the Agent, - but I had strong reasons to believe that this Government were by no means pleased with the conditions of the truce, or
the manner in which it had been negociated FOR and not BY this
Nat'ion, and that tho' they did not think proper formally to disavow
and reject it., yet that they wou'd not be displeased if a plausible
retence shou'd offer to break it, - I was also convinced that a great
LajoritY,if not the whole Nation, were extremely offended for various
reasons, they conceived it intended not only to throw on them the
odium of the manifest treachery in the business, but that it was also
aimed at their Navy, which was now an object of their particnlar
attention, and which for want of some employment, wou'd again sink
into neglect, which they suppose to have been one object of the
English in so eagerly precipitatin this Truce. - Upon the presumption that such was the genera opinion, and my knowledge that
the Spanish Ambassador when at Court on the 15t? Instt had been
treated rather roughly by all the Nobility present when he congratulated the Prince on the happy event of the Truce; - I wrote
a letter to the Minister Yesterday, of which transmit you a Copy pr
this opportunity, and as I have been diligent, i n my Enquiries prior
to my writing, and am particularly favoured m t h the mterest and
support of two very distinguished Personages here, who have honored
me with some particular attentions, I am greatly flattered with
hopes of Success; if I find there is a prospect of a speedy and favorable
Answer, it is probable I may detain the Vessel a day or two in order
to Convey such intelligence which will be so very important and
acceptable to the United States. * * *

P. S. I cannot give a stronger proof of the Sincerity of the disgust
and disappointmt of this Court on account of the Truce w* Algiers,
than that the Spanish & British Ministers were unsuccessfully opposed
to the granting Us a Convoy, this comes from the best Authority,
even Martin ho de Mello favoured Us in this instance - in short the
British have lost ground by this left-handed policy, and the general
opinion that I do not love them over-much is now no small recommendation of me; I think this would not be an unfavblemoment to
propose a commercial Treaty upon a broad & liberal Basis
the
advantage could not fail in every view to preponderate in our favor I wish this may be taken into immediate and serious consideration as

may benefit their navigation or commerce as far as may be compatible

that the vessels of the said states shall enjoy m their passage the same
protection which she has ordered to be extended to the vessels of the
Hanseatic towns until the conclusion of the ratification of the truce
adjusted between her M. F. Majesty $ the regency of Algiers: provided nevertheless that the vessels of the US. which shall desire to
shelter themselves under the protection of the said convoys, shall
unite & assemble in sufficient nuplber to merit to be convoyed; as
this measure cannot be practised m favor of a few, for clear reasons
which manifest themselves.

Consisting of Wheat, Flour, Indian Corn & Rice will sell exceeding
well, these articles having risen considerably in Consequence of what

to take Shelter from the Algerines The sum of four Hundred thousand Hard Dollar's has been just
raised here by a number of English, Irish, & Scotch Houses for the
purpose of speculating on the American Property which may be taken
by the Algerines, The Merchant's of Gibraltar are disposed to do
the same, & I am sorry to observe many among them there & here,
who owe much to America, This I fear will encourage these in their

"has captured in the latter end of October ten American Vessels, the

but it would seem as if the Ho e had arrived after it was written. ALI the Cruisers were a t dgiers save one Ship and ready to sail
again, with the addition of a Genoese Polacra they had armed. This ship I am very sorry to add passed up about ten days ago, having
been at anchor 12'Vnst off Larach with an American Brig loaded at

SIR I wrote you on my f i s t arrival here which perhaps may not

being Captured the llth[see 3 November] of Oct. by an Algirine
Frigate of 26 Guns 50 Leagues S W. of Cape SVincent and brought
to this place where I arrived the 30* of Oct. when we were all put on
shore, where I found the unfortunate Crews of 10 more Americans all
captured in October, On our landmg we were all put into Chains
without the least distinction and put to hard labor from daylight
untill night with only the allowance of two small black loaves and
Water & close confined a t night we suffered much on board the Cnriser,
for when they boarded us they even took the clothes from our backs
& brought us on board almost naked in this s~tuationthey put us
into the Cable Tier without any thing, not even a blanket to Cover
us where we remained untill our m v a l here without even a shirt
to shift us. Death would be a great relief & more welcome than a
continuance of our present situation, without a peace you may be
assured that the whole coast of Europe will be blockaded by their
Cruisers, as they have been as far as Cape Ortegal, and it is not a
doubt but they will go as far next Sp
as the Channel of England,
as they are building more Cruisers, T ey have now four Frigates
from 26 to 46 Guns. Two Brigs of 24. four Zebecks of 20 p & four
smaller ones which have all been at sea since their Truce w?th Porm more
tugal. The Cruisers that are now at sea we expect will b
Prizes tho' God forbid for the situation of the Convicts at t e Castle
would be happiness to our situation, for we think ourselves happy if
we escape through the day being beat by our drivers, who c m e s a

SIR, Since my letter N G , of which the foregoing is a Copy, I have
been deprived of a Conveyance from hence to America to have the
honor of addressing you. Captain Gooch of the Deboniar was chased
by an Algireen which obliged him to put into Gibraltar and continued
there till the 28'" of November when he Sailed with four other American Ships bound home under convoy of a portugueeze Frigate of war
destined for Lisbon: I had the pleasure of seeing Colonel Humphreys at Malaga very
soon after he sent me the express from Gibraltar mentioned in my
former letter, from hence he proceeded on by land to Alicante where
he has been waiting for an answer from Algiers to know if he would be
allowd to go and treat with the Dey of that Regency. I have no
advice from the Colonel on the Bussyness, but advices have come
here lately from Alicante that he has received a most arrogant Denial
forbidding his going to Algiers, I wish the report may not be true. By advlces from Algiers of the 4'p November I am informed that y9
Algereen fleet that Saded the 6" of October through the streights into
the Atlantic were all returned to that Port and had brought m t h them
thirteen American and three Genoeese prizes, but no list of the Names
thereof have yet appeared excepting one Capital Ship called the Hope,
John Burnham that was coming to Malaga from Rotterdam in ballast
and was met by the Enemy at the entrance of the streights, this Ship
is of four hundred Tons measurment her crew consisted of eighteen
men and two British Passengers one of which has a house of bussyness
Established at this place to whom he gives a very deplorable account
of the treatment given to the American and other prisoners taken by
them Barbarians. I t is well known that her Faithfull Majesty is much displeased with
the Algereens having so suddenly committed a breach of the truce
agreed for her with the Regency, for i t would appear that the latter
was bound not to send a Cruizer into the Atlantic until1 the expiraand the Comtion of four months after exchangeing the prelemina
mander of her naval force that was Stationed in t e Strelghts was
blamed for letting their fleet pass on the 6'p october. -

Algerines first Cruize, notwithstanding the reports to the contrary. I am Sorry to tell you, he advises Capture of the Brig Minema of

600,000. ---to the Dey & Family 600,000. --- to the Officers of the Regency Ambassadorial & Consular presents, which he Estimates at 600,000.

[SDA. CL, Gibraltar, Vol. 1, April 1791-Dec. 1795.1
Concerning Naval Force adequate to protection of commerce of the United States
against Algiers

Communicated to t h House of Representatives, 20 Januanj, 1794
Mr. Fitzsimons, from the committee appointed to report the naval
force adequate to the protection of the commerce of the United States
against the Algerine corsairs, together with an estimate of the expense,
and the ways and means for defraying the same, made the following
report:
THAT,
by the best information the committee could obtain, it
a pears that the naval force of the Algerines consists of light vessels,
of' different size and force, (exclusive of galleys) carrying in the whole
two hundred and eighty-two guns; and that it has not varied considerably for many years past; that the vessels (except two*or three)
are slenderly built, smaller in size than vessels of war belongmg to the
Christian Powers, c a m the same number of guns, and principally
manned with people bttle accustomed to the management of large
ships.
From a consideration of these circumstances, the committee are of
opinion that four ships, capable of carrying forty-four guns, each, and
two ships, carrying twenty-four guns, each, will be sufficient to protect
the commerce of the United States against the Algerine corsairs.
That the cost of the naval armament aforesaid, including six months'
stores and provisions, and three months' pay to the officers and
seamen, will amount to- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - $600,000
That the annual expense of the said armament, as the same may
probably be kept in service, will amount to - - - - - - - - - - - - - 247,960

.

WARS WITH BARBARY POU'ERS

61

The particulars of which estimate are detailed in the papers submitted with this report.
The ways and means proposed by the committee for defraying the
cost and annual expense of all the said armament are,
An additional duty of one per cent. on all goods which now pay a
duty of seven and a half per cent.
An additional duty of five per cent. on all stone and earthen ware,
and marble and slate, bricks, k c . imported. An additional duty of
three cents per bushel on salt; of twenty-five cents per ton on alf ships
or vessels, other t n ships or vessels of the United States; and of six
cents per ton on a ships or vessels of the United States, employed in
foreign trade; which said several duties they estimate to produce three
hundred and three thousand seven hundred and thirty-two dollars,
agreeably to the estimate No. 1, herewith.
In pursuance of all which, the committee submit the following
resolutions:
Resol~ed,That a naval force, to consist of four ships of forty-four,
and two ships of twenty guns, each, be provided, for the protection of
the commerce of the United States against the Algerine corsairs.
Resolved, That, for the purpose of defraying tohecost of a naval
armament, and the annual expense thereof, after the - - - - - - day of
------,------,
there be levied, collected, and paid, upon all goods,
wares, and merchandise, imported into the United States, and on
which a duty of seven and a half per cent. is now payable, an additional duty of one per cent.
Upon all marble, slate, and other stone; on bricks, tiles, tables,
mortars, and other utensils of marble or stone; and, generally, upon
all stone and earthen ware, an additional duty of five per cent. Upon
salt, three cents per bushel, estimating the bushel at fifty-slx pounds.
On ships or vessels of the United States, employed in foreign trade,
six cents per ton; on all other ships and vessels, twenty-five cents
per ton.
That the like drawbacks and allowances be mado of the said additional duties as are now made of the duties upon go,~dsexported from
the United States, and upon fish and salted provisions.
That a separate account of the said duties be kept.
That the President of the United States be authorized to receive,
on loan, a sum not exceeding - - - - - - dollars, to be applied towards
the building and equipment of the said naval armament, a t an interest
not exceeding - - - - - - per cent. per annum; and that the said l o a ~be
open to any individual, body politic or corporate, within the United
States. That the revenues herein before recited he pledged for the
payment of the interest on the loan aforesaid, and the annual expense
of the said armament; and that the surplus of such revenue be applied
to the repayment of the principal, and to no other purpose whatever.
That a committee be appointed to bring in a bill or bills in conformity with the foregoing resolutions.

tually transmit to you the state of things a t the moment, whensoever,

I shall receive notice from this port, New-York, or Baltimore, in consequence of the arrangements, which I am taking, that any vessel is

sailing for your residence.
I did not expect to have troubled you with another letter, before
an answer was prepared to that of compliment from her Majesty.
But being just informed that the vessel expedited with the Algerine
intelligence, is returning directly from New-York to Lisbon, and that
the mail of to morrow is the last, which will reach her, I cannot neglect
the opportunity of enabling you to anticipate by your informal and
occasional interviews with the Ministry those sentiments of regard,
which her Majesty's late conduct has inspired, and which the President
will soon embrace an occasion of interweaving in the reply to her letter.
By advices from several respectable quarters, we dady learn, that
some one or other of the powers of the Mediterranean, who have
hitherto contributed to keep the pirates of Algiers in check, are withdrawn, by negotiation, terror, or actual invasion from hostility against
them. If our correspondents had been even silent as to the original
author of this defection, our general suspicions would have directed us
to the B d i s h government. But all doubts would vanish ij it be true as
it it represented, t h d a british Consul, without authority from the @een
of Portugal, has presumed to conclude a truce with the Algennes,
imposing a heavy tribute upon her, and annihilating the principal
cause of vigor to her marine.
It cannot, therefore, be too strongly impressed upon the Court of
Lisbon, how highly the President of the United States esteems the
ma animity with which that t m e , has been resisted by her Majesty,
wit what satisfaction he discerns in her o position an attention-to
the welfare of the United States - how apt y it reciprocates our m h
to bind the two natiolls more closely together; how grateful the
Citizens of the United States have shewn themselves to this instance
of her favor; and how much i t must be an object with the American
shipping to resort to her ports, where they will find such ample
protection. The arrogance of the British Consul, in forming the truce,
if he acted without orders from home, and the indignity to the Portuguese
nution, if no previous assent was given to the measure, - strike us here
very forcibly. But you, who are on the spot can alone determine,
whether t h sensibility qf the Court be enough alive, and circumstances
permzt. thud remarks of this kind may be used. I t is the earnest desire
of the President, that nothing be omitted, which is conciliato~y,and
that every thing which may irritate, be avoided.
We entertain a hope, founded upon your zeal and knowledge, that
Algiers before the receipt of this letter, will have been soothed into
terms, proper for our acceptance. But as this is uncertain, and a
peace with those, who are educated in Sea-robberies, is very unstable,
altho' sanctioned by every profession and solemnity; we ought to
obtain a statement of some facts, which we do not seem yet to possess
with accuracy. I am anxious therefore to be precisely informed.
1. What are the nations, bordemg on the Mediterranean, who are
generally exposed to the ravages of the Algerines 2. What naval force those nations have been accustomed to employ,
or can, in case of exert.ion, employ against the Algennes.
3. Is it probable, that they would associate with us, to restrain the
Algerines; and upon what terms?

f?

f'

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS

4. Upon what terms, is i t probable, that they would furnish a
stated armament, equal to the object, without any Ships being supplied b the United States.
5.
ch of the Mediterranean Powers, who are commonly a t war
with Algiers, have been debauched from it, by the interposition of
Great Britain, or any other Go~ernment.
Portugal, however, is the best bulwark which any alliance on
our part can find against those Rovers. Let me entreat you therefore,
to enter freely into discourse with her Minister, and fix with precision,
his ideas of the mode, which promises most success. We cannot
doubt his candor; but the ascendancy of Great Britain, is too often manifested in her Councils. Hence you will impose no restraint on yourself,
in your conversation with him, except sofur, as there may be a danger of
injurious communications being made to the Court of London.
The President has instructed me to urge you to seize the present
moment for discovering what may be expected from an attempt to
accomplish a treaty of commerce. With the omen of a good disposihon
in Portugal; with the intrinsic importance of our trade with her,
increased by the multiplication of our Citizens, and secured by a
neutrality, which a convulsion in Europe, although nearly mversal,
cannot compel us to abandon; - Portugal must discover inducements
to a connection with us now, which perhaps may not be so strongly
felt, when the other nations are less engaged in war, and thelr bpleasure may fall more sorely. * * *

To Secretary of State from Nathaniel Cutting, Lisbon, Portugal
(Duplicate.)

SIR,Knowing that Colonel Humphreys has beed very assiduous in
improving every opportunity to acquaint the Executive of the Umted
States with the steps he has taken in pursuance of his mission to the
Dey & Regency of Algiers, I have hitherto thought i t unnecessary
for me to give you the trouble or perusing anything on that Subject: - but as I had the honor of bemg employ'd by tbe Department
of State, in a subordinate capacity [Secretary of David Humphreys],
on the same mission, I hope ou will not think me impertinent @
communicating to you some o servations reJative to the busmess m
question which have occurred to me in its progfess. The only
Letter I have written relative to my proceedings m ~t was from this
City soon after my arrival here last year, - giving a simple narrative
of my progress towards Algiers, and of the circumstances which had
unexpectedly impeded it. - I beg leave to refer you to that Letter,
and to resume the subject a t the period when it is datad. The intelligence that I received soon after my arrival a t Lisbon,
and a comparative view of all the information I previously possessessed,
confirmed me in the opinion I had long entertained that the mission
to Algiers would prove fruitless. As a proof that my mind was then
imprest with that idea, I take the liberty to observe that m 8 Letter
which I wrote to John Vaughan Esq' - Philadelphia, under date
Lisbon 9*) Septl ultQ,without giving any indication of my real pursuit,

g

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1786 TO 1801

I exprest my apprehension that Coercion would be an indispensible
preliminary to a Treaty of Peace with Algiers on reasonable terms.
The Event but too fully justifies my opinion. I presume that Colonel
Humphreys has given you in detail, as far as was necessary, an account
of the slow & tedious jobb wh[ic]h I undertook a t Gibraltar; I mean
that of adjusting the affairs which the late Thomas Barclay Esq: had
at that place, (in his capacity of a Public agent.) - As he left no
books of accounts nor any regular Invoices, to direct us, I had to
proceed on such detached documents as happened to be deposited
with M' James Simpson of that City, with whose friendly and unremitted assistance, I was enabled to make the arrangement which
Colonel Humphreys has, I suppose, transmitted to your office, and
which I hope is honored with your approbation. We had to examine
and repack every article of merchandlse left there by Mt Barclay, in
order to select such as might be useful in the negotiation we had in
hand, - and likewise that we might ascertain precisely, & obtain
a specific receipt for, the merchandise that might still remain deposited
a t Gibraltar. Before this business was accomplished, we had the mortification to
hear of the Truce between Algiers & Portugud, and to see the Pyratical
Flag display'd in the Bay of Gibraltar by one of those Ships of War
which the insidious policy of certain European Powers has let loose
to ravage the Commerce of America in the Atlantic. Though from
that moment i t might naturally be concluded that our mission would
prove abortive, yet Colonel Humphreys, whose attachment to, and
zeal in support of, the True Interests of his Country is not to be
shaken by any common obstacles, - thought it indispensibly necessary for us to proceed on our expedition as far as we could with any
degree of safety to ourselves, or prospect of advantage to the United
States.
A previous step to be taken was to dispatch Expresses both by
Sea & Land to convey intelligence to Cadiz, Lisbon & Malaga respecting this unforseen occurrence, which threatened such terrible depredations on the Commerce of the United States.
Mr James S i son of Gibraltar, seconded all our opperations with
that indefatigab e zeal and activity which indicates sincere amity
and an invincible attachment to the cause of humanity. * * * * * *
We had reason to apprehend that certain British Agents, either
authorized by Government, or self-constituted in the hope of promoting their own interest by injuring that of the United States, had vgilantly regarded our proceedmgs and had transmitted such
intelligence to the Algerines as might render it particularly dangerous
for us to proceed up the Mediterranean by Sea, though under the
protection of a Flag now respected by the Dey & Regency of Algiers; - and the property of the United States aboard the Vessel,
it was thought, would pass more securely to Alicante without us, in
case of being examined by any of the Pyrates, than if Colonel Humphreys and myself were on board. For if any of the Renagadoes discovered that we were Americans i t would immediately excite their
suspicions respecting the property on board; and discovering so large
sn amount in Specie, they would probably have been induced to
disregard the neutrality of the Flag we were under, and either take
us and the property out, or carry the Vessel and all into Algiers. I t
was therefore thought expedient for us to proceed to Alicanta by

P

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS

Land; - t h being the Port where we could have the most ready
communication with Algiers. After a tedious & fatiguing Journey of
above four hundred miles, over the worst roads, perhaps, in the
Universe, we arrived a t Alicante on the 2e November. - We found
in Mr Montgomery the American Consul there, a shady, zealous
and active friend, firmly attached to the interest of the United States,
and disposed to co-opperate in our pursuits even to the neglect of his
private affairs. - Doubtless Colonel Humphreys has transmitted
you in detail the account of his dispatching run Express Boat to
Algiers - Of the haughty and insolent reply of the Dey to the person
who acquainted him with our mission, - and finally, of his utter
refusal to receive Colonel Humphreys as Commissioner Plenipotentiary
from the United States, or to treat with him on any terms whatever.
The property which we had in charge belonging to the Unitad States,
yet remained on board the Swedish Vessel which convey'd i t to
Alicante; - and as the object of our mission appeared now to be
unattainable, it became necessary to deposite this property in other
hands. The pressing necessities of those unfortunate Americans who
had been recently carried into Algiers, a9 well as those who had been
years in Captivity there, demanded an appropriation of a considerable
proportion of the Specie. Colonel Humphreys, whose humanit was deeply interested on this
occasion, naturally judged that not on!ry the Executive of the United
States, but the Citizens at large, would applaud the exercise of his
discretionary power in applying such a sum to the immediate relief
of the suffering prisoners as might prevent their sinking under the
hardships which they must inevitably encounter. - He therefore
determined to take immediate order for that benevolent purpose. On
mature deliberation it was thought proper thus to appropriate Sixteen
thousand dollars, - as being a supply sufficient for one year, in the
course of which the Government of the United States might make such
further arrangements as should be found expedient. Intelligence
from Madrid, & the critical situation of the political Connection between Europe and the United States of America, excited some suspicion that a rupture might soon take place between the latter &
Spain: - I therefore took the liberty of advising Colonel Hurnphreys
not to leave the remaining twenty-four thousand dollars in specie,
within the power of the Spanish Government; but to authorize Mr
Montgomery to invest i t immediately in good B a s on London,
which were then under par at Alicante; -by which means it might be
transferr'd to Lisbon so as to gain about ten p: Cent whenever i t should
be necessary to re-invest the amount in mexican dollars. - My advice
was seconded by the opinion of Ms Montgomery, - but Colonel
Humphreys, no doubt for very good reasons, did not think proper to
follow it; - and postponed any final decision on the subject till he
should have consulted M' Carmichael and Mr Short at Madrid.
Therefore by direction of Colonel Humphreys I had both the specie
and rnerchandize landed; the former deposited with Mr Montgomery;
the latter in the Custom House. What ulterior arrangements Colonel
Hmphreys has made in the business, I do not know, - as he has not
honored me with any communication on that subject since we left
Alicante. - We returned via Madrid, and arrived safe at this City
on the night of the 24'? ultv -

66

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1786 TO 1801

Pennit me now to make a few observations which occur on the subject of the foregoing narrative. From the best intelligence I have obtained, and from comparing circumstances, I am fully of opinion that the English Government has
been the principal and primary cause that our mission to Algiers has
proved abortive. The Portugueze Cabinet of itself has had but little
hand in bringing about the melancholly catastrophe which has added
so greatly to the number of our suffering Citizens - to the actual loss
of property as well as to the general injury of our Trade.
The Success which the Corsairs of Algiers have already had, has
confirmed the Dey in his exorbitant conhtions for a Peace, & rendem
it more necessary than ever that the principal preliminary on our part
be a respectable naval armament. If Colonel Humphreys had been so
fortunate as to arrive in Algiers previous to the Portugueze Truce
being agreed on, he might possibly have retarded that Event, or have
contrived some means to prevent its immediate ill consequences to
the Commerce of the U. S. A. ;- but I M y believe that neither the
Logic or Eloquence of an Angel would have prevailed on the Dey &
Regency to have agreed to a peace with the U. S. A. on any of the
Terms prescribed by our Legmlature. The pecuniary consideration
was not sufficient, - no, not by some hundreds of thousands of dollars! - I wish, however, very sincerely, that the experiment could
have been tried. * * * * * *
In my opinion it would be more to the honor and advantage of any
nation which is determined to keep up a naval establishment, to expend ten times the sum in supporting a Squadron of Ships of War in
the Mediterranean sufficient to protect its Commerce, than tamely to
comply with the insolent demands which the chief of a gang of Robbers
is leased to make. !he grand principle that has hirtherto opperated upon all the maritime Powers of Europe in this business, appem to me to be not so
much the offspring of fear and avarice, as of jealousy & envy. - A
miserable spirit of illiberality has induced them to practice all the
infamous arts offinesse rather than openly and steadily to pursue a gallant warfare against those petty villains who wantonly infringe the
rights, and impede the social intercourse between different members,
of "the great family of mankind". - Each one seems to entertain the
contemptible apprehension that some other, or perhaps all the other,
Commercial Nations might profit of its exertions, and enjoy the advantages of a peaceful Commerce without being at any trouble or
expense in protecting it; - therefore each aims seperately to bribe the
common aggressor, whom they might easily Crush, - in the expectation of gainmg some exclusive advantage by it: or rather, actuated by
the despicable motive abovemention'd, no one of them is w d h g disinterestedly to promote the general welfare of mankind; - but occasionally plays off this scourge of Commerce upon each other, according
as particular passions or interests may happen to predominate. How small a proportion of the immense amount that has been received by the States of Barbary as the price of peace with this last
half Century, would support a naval armament sufficient to annihilate
their Marine! This, I am aware, would not be so eas an achievement
as many imagine; - but still I think it within the k e of possibility
if proper methods are ursued. It is not great f o ~ c ethat is so necessary
to effect this desireab e purpose, as great vigihnce, activity, p h m t ~ .&

persevereance.
Portugal, by keeping a small Squadron on this
service for some years past, has demonstrated that the depredations
of the Pyratical Corsairs of Algiers & Tunis may easily be confined to
the Mediterranean. The Portugueze Naval Commanders though
brave, & their mariners though probably capable and obedient, yet
are supposed to have been rather remiss in pursuit of the object for
and
which they were, ostensibly, stationed in the Mediterranean;
are known to be very timid with respect to cruizing where time or
place presents any djfllculty. If the Portugueze so effected much,
what might be expected from a similar force, the opperations of
which would be directed by skill & intrepidity, stimulated by resentment of unprovoked injury, - by a
of obtaining exemplary
revenge, - and above aLl actuated by the noble desire of serving the
cause of humanity & promoting the interests of Universal Commerce! -

-

Another proof of the envious and .rindicti~redisposition of the
English Government towards us is the unjust capture & detention of
so many of our ships on false or frivolous pnetences. - And, finally,
to cramp our flourishing Commerce still further, and to do us irreparable injury, I am convinced that the same Government, by its
malevolent machinations, has paved the way for, and incited the
Algerines to, actual Hostdities against our nation; for the consequences of which, it is impossible in the nature of things that we can
ever obtain adequate compensation. The l a o m and immediate agent in this infernal conspiracy against
our peace and prosperity is at this instant walking in the Garden
beneath my window, with all the apparent composure & self-complaoency that can be inspired by successful villainy: Mr Logie, late
the British Consul a t Algiers, - who, unsolicited by the Court of
Portugal, negotiated the fatal Truce which has eventually wrested
from a considerable number of our industrious Citizens their Liberty,
from others their property - and from some, both: - and probably
has deprived their sympathizing Country & Connexions of the services
of many of them forever!
Mr Logie the other day in conversation
with Colonel Hurnphreys had the impudence to attempt excr~lpating
himself and the British Government from the blame cast upon them
by every disinterested person, - and, so far as I can learn, by the
Court of Port?lgul itself - for this nefarious and abominable transaction. He asserts that this Court earnestly prest lum to it; but
I do not believehim. * * *
After maturely weighing in my own mind actual circumstances and
their consequences, I feel confident that if my Fellow Citizens at
large in the U. S. have the WILL,they will find no deficiency in the
POWER, immediately to equip a naval Force that would be sficient
to defeat the malicous purposes of their enemies abroad, and be the
surest parrantee of peace and prosperity at home. -

As I have hinted above, some politicians, - as shallow, perhaps,

may think it premature to launch into the expence of a
naval expedition against the Algerines, till we have by Treaty secured
certain privileges in any or all of the European Ports. - I n my
humble opinion no other possible circumstance nor argument could
give so much efficacy to our negociations for those privileges, or any

other of a Commercial nature, as our having a respectable naval armament ready to put to sea. - This spirited & necessav exertion on
the part of the United States, though expensive in the h t instance,
would eventually prove good economy, - and must opperate every
way in their favor. It would, I am persuaded, preclude much useless discussion that now protracts the negociations of their Agents
with foreign Courts - it would almost instantaneously liberate our
valuable Commerce in the Mediterranean, and greatly facilitate our
intercourse with other markets where many productions of our Country would meet an advantageous sale;-and i t is evident that the
result would be a reduction of expence in some instances and an
increase of revenue in others. -

SIR An Act being under consideration of the Legislature of the
United States, for the equipment of some Ships of War, to check the
depredations of the Algerines upon the Commerce of America, and
understanding that it will rest in the option of the President, either to
build the proposed Armament here, or to procure them in any way,
that he may judge most elegible. - You have promised to excuse me,
while I take the liberty to communicate such information as fell under
my notice when I was last in France. - I was a t Bourdeaux iil June
last when I saw a number of fine large Copper-bottomed Frigate built
ships, from 26 to 30 Guns - some of which were quite new - these
Vessels had been built for the East India and Guinea trade, and which,
from the situation of that Country were become useless to the Ownersmany of whom would have been happy to have disposed of them, for
less than half their first cost - I had certain information that a t
Brest, there were several ships mounting forty Guns, under similar
circumsta~lceswith those a t Bourdeaux I cannot indeed say whether
the French Government will permit those Ships to be fitted under the
Flag of the United States - but I will venture an opinion, that if this
permission could be obtained, those ships might be put to sea a t an
expence far below what such Vessels would cost here, & several Months
earlier a t sea. I am just now about sailing upon a Voyage to Havana shall be
ready on my return to answer any questions you may think proper
to ask respecting this business. I will esteem it as a particular honour, if You will be pleased to
mention my name to the President of the United States, for the
Command of One of the Armed Vessels - my character is well known
in this City, Yet should it be necessary to present a recommendation
my Friends Gurney & Smith will procure i t and act for me during my
absence which I don't expect will exceed two Months. [SDA. CL, Algiers, Vol. 1, Part 1, April 1785-July 1795.1

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1785 TO 1801

It appears to be of indispensable necessity that immediate arrangements should be made to obtain the articles contained in the estimate
and to have them transported to the ports before mentioned - excepting such articles of the timber as may be obtained at, or in the neighbourhood of, the said places.
The live oak and red cedar must principally be obtained from the
islands on the coast of Georgia. Some parts however may be obtained
in North Carolina, although it is alledged that the farther South the
live oak the better
Different opinions are entertained as to the most certain, and the
most occonomical mode of obtaining the live oak and cedar from
Georgia, and transporting the same to the ports where the ships are
to be built.
Some persons recommend that one or more persons in whom due
confidence may be placed, should repair to the Islands of Georgia,
and contract with the proprietors of the timber as it stands for such
parts as will serve the moulds, and that a sufficient number of axe-nzen
with their provision, be sent from the northward, in order to cut the
same, and transport it to the places where it is to be used. These
persons assert that any contract made in Georgia or other parts to the
Southward, will be executed by negroes, whose indolence and carelessness will inevitably produce disappointment or loss.
The moulds for the timbers of both sized ships are preparing and
nearly finished. These must be transported to the places where the
timber is to be cut, otherwise mistakes would arise and disappointment of course ensue.
Besides the mode before mentioned, there are ersons who recommend a contract with some persons, if such coul be found, which is
said to be the case to procure the timber in Georgia, and transport it
to the respective ports or places.
You will please to judge which of these two modes will be preferable.
I have understood that in 1776 or 1777 the frames of two 74
were cut under the authority of the United States, part at unbury
ships
and part a t a place called Eilkenny near the mouth of Savannah River,
and that as the said timber was very large, part of it yet remains it may
therefore be proper to look it up, and if it should answer for the frames
of the proposed frigates as probable it would be excellent from its
long seasoning.
I have the honor to submit to you a letter from M' Wereat of Georgia
upon this subject, the purport of which is confirmed by Brigadier
General Gunn of the same state.
The manner in which these vessels ought to be built has been under
consideration, that is whether the hull and other parts susceptible of
the measure should be built by a contract, or by a capable agent or
agents appointed for the purpose of procuring the labor and materials.
Upon enquiry however it a pears improbable that a contract could
r s this place for the one directed to
be formed with the ~ h i ~ b u g d ein
be built here. They alledge that if a contract was offered and accepted by two or more it would excite the ill will and envy of those
who had no part in it, and as the frigate would require many hands
the price of that sort of labor would rise, and that therefore it would
be in the power of those not employed to raise the wages of the Journeymen a shilling or two per day, which would occasion great embarrassments, if not ruin, to the undertakers. Hence it would appear to

f

6

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS

73

follow as a consequence that if the Shipbuilders of Philsdelphia, some
of whom have considerable capitals, would decline a contract, that it
would be almoat or quite impracticable to obtain the building by contract elsewhere. If this should be so, then Agents respectable for
their int.elligence, activity, and integrity must be sought in the places
in which the said frigates are directed to be built.
The President of the United States has approved of the said vessels
being built under the directions of some agent or a ents which I presume it will be in your department to nominate to $,
I suppose however if you should find it practicable to build them by
contract, that the subject will still be reconsidered by him,and as for
myself I should find great satisfaction in a contract, if one, upon solid
principles, could be obtained.

inconveniences, when they arise in the course of their functions, I c m
compensate it only by a promise not to heap such business upon you
unnecessarily. But I trust, that you will take the proper measures,
respecting the public money in M' Montgomery's hands at Alicant,
and reimburse the Swedish Consul, according to the ideas, which you
have expressed on that occasion We were fearful from your letter of the 17" of Februarg 1794,
that the important, interesting, and never to be forgotten su ject of
our fellow citizens in Algiers would suffer from the want of some person
who might embrace any favorable moment. You then declared, that
you considered yourself as discharged from the Algerine mission. But
a subsequent indication of hope, and your reassumption of the &air,
until you should be relieved, have banished much of the anxiety which
- - entertained. In truth, Sir, it is impossible to dismiss you from
was
this service The enclosed letter from M' Gouvr Morris, connected with your
former instructions, this letter and your own operations mark the
sense of the Executive and the point at which the Algenne buslpess
has arrived. Col. Monroe, the Successor of Mr Morris as our mlnlster
in France, has been written to on this subject. He has been informed,
that the President learns with great satisfaction the new testimony,
given by the French Republic of attachment to the interests of the
United States; not doubting at the same time, that it must prove
beneficial to the supplies of France from hence: that the powers derived
from Mr Morris to the Agent who was to accompany on our part, the
French Commissioner, though as yet unknown to us, have no doubt
been judicious, and the acts in conformity with those powers will be
confirmed if they be found to come within the plan hitherto adopted:
that you were however appointed to this business in a special manner,
possess a full knowledge of our views and our means, and have been
particularly conversant in our attempts for peace with Algiers: that
you will therefore instruct, if you shall find it necessary, the Agent
appointed b Mr Morris; that we trust the auspices of the French
be continued to the efforts under your guidance; and
Republic
that as an evidence of our confidence in the French Government Col.
Monroe is empowered, if he thinks proper, to impart the terms, upon
which we offer to buy peace.

You will therefore consider yourself, as again charged with this
important interest of our country, according to the former instructions.
A power is lodged with Messp Willinks, Van Staphorsts and Hubbard
to borrow 800,000 dollars, and to hold the same to your draught.
Whensoever therefore the money can be used in our objects at Algiers,
you will draw for it. I t must be submitted to your discretion, upon
the view of all circumstances, as well of personal danger as public
benefit, whether you will go over yourself: a measure which unquestionably would enable you to seize more certainly, than when at a
distance, one of those moments of good humour and caprice, which
the letters transmitted through you from Algiers designate as the
lucky seasons for impressing the Dey, and consider, as having unfortunately for our country escaped without being caught. If however you
find it unsafe or impracticable to undertake the mission yourself, it
will then be proper to use the instrument, selected by Mr Morris and
to instruct him accordingly; maintaining always perfect cordiality
and concert with the French Commissioner, but a t the same time not
hesitating to follow your own ideas, when they shall seem preferable;
and resorting to the Swedish Consul at Algiers, his brother, or any
other individual or expedient according to your judgment on the best
mode of accomplishing success The President has under consideration the mode, in which the 800,000 dollars may be expended in the purchase of a peace; that is how
much shall be applied to the ransom and how much to the peace The newspapers will be sent by this conveyance. The letters whose
receipt I have to acknowledge since my last are the following. N Q
117. 118. April lo'!' 121. April 20. with sundry duplicates and triplicates I should not have closed this letter, before an addition, which I contemplate on the general state of our &airs was completed; were it not
for my solicitude for our friends in Algiers. I will however add at present, that finding a loss to the United States by the exchange of bills on
Amsterdam, I have determined to remit for the use of our ministers
at Lisbon and Madrid in an order from the Commissioners of his
Catholic Majesty here on the public treasury at Madrid. I have
accordingly sent to Ma Short a draught from them for 9,000 dollars;
u on which you wiU be pleased to draw; and I shall continue this mode
o remittance half yearly, unless you should disapprove it.

the preference of a larger annuity and a smaller douceur in hmd,
to the reverse. But we would not break for fifty thousand dollars
per annum, and two hundred thousand dollars by way of douceur,
to secure a peace for a convenient term of years. But tho' this form
of the thin is most eligible; yet it is not judged to be a tine q.~canon.
For after a ,what is usual and effectual must decide, and the pa

may modify accordingly; restricting yourself on the head of a ransom
within the above mentioned limit of three thousand dollars per man.
The President contemplates to send immediately a Consul for the
Barbary coast, who is well acquainted with Algiers in particular. He
will be directed in the first instance to Lisbon, there to receive your
orders.

before a Republican Government to Debate on
It is worthy of Fkmark and Political Observation - that a t the period when
Bussara & Dininio was empowered on American aflairs and that our Views bem e to be Known and that an American Ambsssador. was expected to come and
put a finishing hand to the bueiness. that a t this period in order that the dey

and amount of the exportations of the U S, which by this political Lying &9
Invidious Gszetta. the exportations of the U S. for one yeare was calculated t o
amount. to 26. or 28 Millions of dollars - whether this was the Truth or not it
certainly was not a favourable Symptom of the friendship of Spain towards the
U S, but of course this information or Political Lancet of Spain had its full force

poor & needy he would not extort but would conclude - but as I then declared,
on the part of the U S. was undoubtedly & Irrethat favourable Opwrtunity
-trieveably lost.
But I observe that the d a i r e of tbe Gaazetts intiliigence and frequently eince
backed by underhand Spanish insinuations and aided by theire Confederate the
British, that all must have its Just weight & influence with the Dey. and of course
he-recollects, that if the export* of the U S. amounts to such a sum 8s 26 or 28

became the Chiefe or head of this Government. he renewed the peace with the
British irnd in all the principal articles. adhered to the Treatie. this he did through
fesre. knowing the English was a strong nation by Sea - that would not admit
of any Gross insult.

relative to France, but a little weavering, * * *

Report of Secretary of War concerning Construction of Frigates under the Act of
27 March 1794, communicated to the House of Representatives, 29 December
1794

The Secretary of War, in obedience to the orders of the President
of the United States, submits to the House of Representatives the
following report respecting the frigates authorized by the "Act to
provide a naval armament."
That the passing of the said act created an anxious solicitude that
this second commencement of a navy for the United States should be
worthy of their national character. That the vessels should combine
such qualities of strength, durability, swiftness of sailin and force,
as to render them equal, if not superior, to any frigates %e longing to
any of the European Powers. Researches, therefore, have been made
for the best principles of construction, and such proportions adopted
as have appeared best, upon the most mature advlce and deliberation.
be constructed upon a
The largest ships, of forty-four guns,
scale to contain thirty cannons of the cahber of twenty-four pounds
upon the gun deck. The others, of thirty-sm, twenty-eight cannons,
of the same caliber, upon the gun deck. The remaining force will be
made up of twelve pounders and brass howitzers.
The frigates will be built of live oak and red cedar, in all parts where
they can be used t o advantage. These valuable woods afford the
Uluted States the highest advantages in building ships, the durability
being estimated a t five times that of the common whte oak. Besides
these woods, the best whitf oak, pitch pine, and locust, are directed
to be used in the construction.
Expedients have been devised for seasoning the plank, as expressed
in the letter of Joshua Humphreys, herewith submtted.
But the procuration of the live oak and cedar, being pf Southern
growth, has been retarded b the circumstances specified m the letter
of the Commissioner of the evenue.

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS

91

The building of the ships has been directed in the several following
ports of the Union, in order, as well to distribute the advantages
arising from the operation, as to ascertain a t what places they can be
executed to the greatest advantage, to wit:
One thirty-six a t Portsmouth, New Hampshire;--- - - - - - - - -[Congressj
One forty-four at Boston; ...........................
[Comtitzltwn]
One forty-four at New York;- - ........................

One thirty-six at Baltimore; and - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - [ConsteZZution]
One forty-four a t Portsmouth, or Norfolk, Virginia- - - - -[Chsapeakej
The following arrangement has been adopted for the building and
equipment of the fri ates:
1. All contracts or the principal materials of construction and
equipment have been made m pursuance of law, under the direction
of the Secretary of the Treasury.
2. All labor, and inferior materials, not otherwise provided by the
Secretary of the Treasury, are to be procured by agents whose compensations are two and a half per cent. conformably to their instructions, hereunto annexed, marked No. 1.
3. The captains of the frigates are to superintend the constructio~l
and e uipment, in pursuance of their instructions, No. 2.
4. $he constructors, or master builders, are to be regulated by their
general instructions, No. 3.
It has been endeavored to take these characters from the best
qualified of their profession; and in order that the public should derive
all the advantage of their whole time, they have been detached from
all private pursuits by a liberal compensation, a t the rate of two thousand dollars per annum. I t is possible that, in one or two instances,
agreementsfor their services might have been obtained at a rate somewhat lower; but the invidiousness of the distinctions of different
rewards for men performing the same services would but ill comport
either with the invariable feelings of the human heart, or the public
service; they have, therefore, all been placed upon the same footing.
A clerk to each yard, or place of building, ~sto receive, issue, and to
account for, all public property belonging to the ship, according to his
instructions, No. 4, at the rate of seven hundred and fifty dollars per
annum.
The progress which has been made in the business is generally stated
in the letter of the Commissioner of the Revenue, and the letter of
the captains and constructor of the port of Philadelphia, herewith
submitted.
I t is to be understood that no ex enses were authorized until the
appropriation of the 9th day of June ast, although the act for building
the fngates was passed the 25th day of March.
That few or no materials of any sort, either for construction or
equipment, existed in their proper shape.
That every thing, H not to be created, was to be modified. That
the wood of which the frames were to be made was standing in the
forests; the iron for the cannon lying in its natural bed; and the flax
and hemp, perhaps, in their seed. That the materials will be soon
collected, and the building vigorously pushed, so that the frigates,
according to the o inions contained in the documents herewith submitted, mag be &at in the course of the year one thousand seven
hundred and ninety-five.

sums, if any, will be wanting to complete the same.

the measures upon this subject, merits considerahon.

Xeslr~geof President George Washington to the Congress of the United Staten

UNITED
STATES,
February 68,1796.
Gentlemen of ths Senate and of the House of Represenfatives:
In my h t communication to Congress, during theif present session,
I gave them reason to expect that "certam circumstances of our intercourse with foreign nationsJ' would be transmitted to them. There
was at that time every assurance for believing that some of the most
important of our foreign a B h would have been concluded, and others
considerably matured, before they should rise. But, notwithstanding
I have waited until this moment, i t has so happened that, either from
causes unknown to me, or from events which could not be controlled,
I am yet unable to execute my original intention. That I may, however, fulfil the expectation pven, as far as the actual situation of
things will, in my judgment, ermit, I now, .5ncmJidem,lay before
Congress the following gener'a! statement:
Our minister near the French republic hm urged compensation for
the injuries which our commerce has sustained from captures by
French cruisers, from the nonfulfilment of the contracts of the agents
of that republic with our citizens, and from the embargo at Bordeaux.
He has also pressed an allowance for the money voted by Congress for

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS

93

relieving the inhabitsnts of St. Domingo. I t affords me the highest
pleasure to inform Congress that perfect harmony reigns between the
two republics, and that those claims are in a train of being discussed
with candor, and of being amicably adjusted.
So much of our relation to Great Britain may depend upon the
result of our late negotiations in London, that, until that result shall
arrive, I cannot undertake to make any communication upon this
subject.
After the ne otiation with Spain had been long depending, unusual
.
and unexpeete embarrassments were raised to interrupt its pro
But the commissioner of His Catholic Majesty near the United tates
having declared to the Secretary of State, that, if a particular accommodation should be made in the conducfing of the business, no further
delay would ensue, I thought proper, under all circumstances, to send
to.His Catholic Majesty an envoy extraordinary, specially charged to
brmg to a conclusion the discussions which have been formerly
announced to Congress.
The friendship of Her Most Faithful Majesty has been often manifested in checking the passage of the Algerine corsairs into the Atlantic
Ocean. She has also furnished occasional convoys to the vessels of the
United S t a b , even when bound to other ports than her own. We
may, therefore, promise ourselves, that as, in the ordinary course of
things, few causes can exist for dissatisfaction between the United
States and Portugal, so the temper with which accidental difEculties
will be met on each side will speedily remove them.
Between the Executive of the United States and the Government
of the United Netherlands but little intercourse has taken place during
the last year. It may be acceptable to Congress to learn that our
credit in Holland is represented as standing upon the most respectable
footing.
Upon the death of the late Emperor of Morocco, an agent was
despatched to renew with his successor the treaty which the United
States had made with him. The agent unfortunately died, after he
had reached Europe, in the prosecution of his mission. But, until
lately, it was impossible to determine, with any degree of probability,
who of the competitors for that empire would be ultimately k e d in
the supreme power. Although the measures which have been since
adopted for the renewal of the treaty have been obstructed by the disturbed situation of Amsterdam, there are good g r o ~ d for
s presuming,
as yet, u on the pacific disposition of the Emperor in fact towards the
United tates, and that the past miscarriage will be shortly remedied.
Congress are already acquainted with the failure of the. loan attempted in Holland for the relief of our unhappy fellow-citiz~nsin
Algiers. This subject, than which none deserves a more affectionate
zeal, hm constantly commanded my best exertions. I am happy,
therefore, in being able to say, that, from the last authentic accounts,
the Dey was disposed to treat for a peace and ransom, and that both
would in all probability have been accomplished, had we not been
disappointed m the means. Nothing which depends upon the Executive shall be left undone, for carrying into immediate effect the
supplementary act of Congress.

[PHILADELPHIA]
The PRESIDENT
W . D.March 14. 1795
SIR, Solicitous to retain in the Public service so estimable an
officer as Captain Dale, I wished to place, the indulgence he requests
on such ground as might save that service from injury & afford a
justification to the Executive of the United States in granting him a
furlough.
Cap, Dale will undoubtedly return from China in full time to take
command of the frigate to which he has been appointed. The superintending of her while building may be committed to
Captain Samuel Barron as soon as he returns from Sea, and in the
interim to his uncle Cap-obert
Banon. Both are of Norfolk
experienced Seamen, & recommended by the Agent Mr Pennock &
others. Samuel Barron is a Candidate for s, first Lieutenantcy in the
Navy; & will feel a peculiar interest in performing attentively the
office of Superintendant. - Cap; Dale will compensate them for the
services they render in his stead.
Caps Barry & Cap? Truxton have engaged to afford every advice &
assistance that may be required, relative to Cap*Dale's frigate during
his absence.
Under these circumstances I have thought i t would be expedient
that Cap1 Dale should be indulged with a furlough, during the time

Instructions to Colonel DAVIDHUMPHREYS,
SIR The instructions heretofore communicated to you in several
letters from the office of the Department of State, respecting the
negocirttion with the Dey of Algiers &c: for concluding a treaty of
peace and liberating our Citizens from captivity, contain the sentiments of the President on those subjects, and will serve accordingly
for your general government. If we should not be able to make a
Treaty, comprehending all the articles contained in our Treaty with
Morocco; we must acquiesce in the liberation of our Citizens and a
Treaty of Peace only.
With respect to Morocco, it is proposed to obtain from the Prince
Muley Sol~rnm,a recognition of the Treaty between the United
States and his father the former Emperor. This you will endeavour
to effect if possible for twenty thousand Dollars; but if you shall find
that i t cannot be accomplished under twent five thousand Dollars,
you are authorised to go to that amount.

either accomplish yourself, or by such Agency you ahall deem best
calculated for the purpose, according as you shall find the state of
sirairs in Morocco, upon your arrival in Europe.
For want of more particular knowledge of Tunis and Tripoli, you
can only be informed generally, i t is the instruction of the President,
that Treaties of Peace should be concluded between the United
States, and each of those States, upon as nearly similar principles to
those contained in the Treaty between the late Emperor of Morocco
and the United Stafes, as the circumstmces will dlow, or upon such
general friendly terms as the existing state of affairs may seem to
Justify. - Provided 6 Treaty with each one of the said States can
be concluded for the sum of twenty five thousand Dollars in money or
presents. Joseph Donaldson Junior is named by the President tbs
Consul to those two States. He will of course be employed as Agent
to negotiate with them, unless circumstances should make it necessary for you to proceed up the Mediterranean. In case of the death,
sickness or inability of the said Joseph Donaldson Junior, you are
authorised to appomt such A ent for the purpose as you shall judge
proper. - In the first place, %owever,it is expected that Mr Donaldson will (if deemed necessary) be employed in an Agency with Mr
Pierre Eric Skjoldebrand (now named m Consul of the Umted States
for Algiers) in ascertaining and agreeing upon the provisional or p r e
liminary terms of a Treaty with Algiers; and in causing (under your
directions and instructions) the money appropriated by law for that
purpose, to be paid a t Algiers, in the manner which shall be agreed
upon. Mr Donaldson while employed on these Agencies, will be
allowed by the United States his expenses and one hundred Dollars
per month. After he shdl be established as Consul, he will be entitled only to the sdary limited by law. - As it is conceived that
Phili Sloan (second mate of CaptQOBrien's vessel when taken by
the gerines and lately returned from slavery) will be a very useful
man on this service, he may be employed as Interpreter and Messenger
accordingly. - In addition to his outfits, as furnished by the Purveyor of the United States he will be allowed his expenses - and
twenty six dollars per month, that being the pay of a first Mate of a
revenue cutter in the service of the United States Ms Pierre Eric Skjoldebrand is named Consul of the United States
for Algiers, to whom you will transmit the Commission accordingly.
If Captq Hans Heissel should accept the Consulship for the territories of Morocco, under the dominions of the Prince Muley SoIimaa,
to reside a t Tangier or such place w i t l h the same as shdl be named
you will cause the Commission to be delivered to him accordingly otherwise you will retain the same and give information to the
Executive The funds, appropriated b Law for Barbary affairs, are placed
under your controul. You
obtain information of the particulars
thereof from the Secretary of the Treasury. You will correspond with
Messq John & Francis Baring and draw upon them (in order to remit
to the Barbary States in money, presents or bills) for such sums as
may be necessary (in conformity to our +structions) for the negoaations t c : with Algiers, Tunis and ri oh In sddition to the presents which will pe carried from this port and

SIR I had the honour of addressing your Excellency under the 14

Heysell to Algiers is returned but without bringing him any answer
to his letter to the Dey, but for this he consoles hunself in his usual
way and has now recourse to the expectation of a large Packet from
him Via Carthagena by k t oppertunity
I have by this Vessel of Heysells received several letters from
Algiers, in perticular from Mr Valliere the French Consul and from the
first Secretary to the Dey, these agree in advising what I had apprehended, that Heysell's letter had given Very great ofence to the Dey
who called it audacious impudence, and say that only by assuring
him that this was a peice of oficious folly in the Dane he could be induced to lave thin s m Statu[s]Quo as when Colonel Humphreys sailed

I cannot yet conceive what could be this mans designs in precipitateing the business, whether in order to supplant his friend Humphrey~(who brought him to light) or as the Dey alledged to ruin the
business and prevent our sharing the Trade of the Medeterranian with
his Country men, or elce from IS gross Ignorance of Business and Vain
of what he thought his appointment which he published with the

I had received from Mr Humphreys and contrary to every thing that

To Joseph Donaldson, Junior, U. 8. Agent, Algiers, from David Humphreys,
U. S. Minister to Lisbon, Portugal, and in charge of negotiations with Barbary
Powers

(Secret & confidential)
I
You will be pleased to proceed to Algiers, without d e l ~ in
,
order to deliver the letters herewith committed to you, and partic arly
that addressed to the Consul of France, who has on a former occasion
offered us his friendly assistance & who is now most earnestly solicited
to use his best influence in favour of our negotiations with the Dey &
Regency.
If, upon conferring in a confidential & secret manner with the
Consul of France, you shall fmd that a Treaty can be effected within
the limits of the Sums mentioned in the enclosed Extract of a letter
of the 16" of Aug? last from Algiers, marked NQ1. (or upon better
terms if they can be obtained, and which you will endeavour to
obtain if possible) - or for the amount of the Sum appropriated by
Law for the purpose (as specified in the enclosed Memorandum, marked
NQ2.) you will proceed to arrange & agree upon a Provisional Treaty.
That is to say, a Treaty providing, that the liberation of our Citizens
in Captivity at Algiers shall take effect, as soon as the Money can be
paid according to agreement. If this object should be so far accomplished, i t will then be necessary for you to come to Lisbon, with as
much expedition as possible, for the purpose of transferring the Money,
which it is hoped & expected may be in readiness by that time or very
shortly afterwards. The more haste is urged on this occasion because
it is most ardently wished that we may be enabled to extricate our
Citizens from Slavery, if it be by any means practicable, before they
shall again be visited by that dreadful scourge of Heaven, the Plague.
The early liberation of these unhappy men from their present distressing & perilous condition is considered to be an object too dear &
too interesting to all the feelings of humanity, to admit of one moment's delay. - even of that delay which would in the first instance
be requisite to concert with the Government of France (as we contemplate to do immediately, and as we flatter ourselves from their
friendly dispositions & intimations we shall be able to do) such measures as may be efficacious for giving success to our negotiations with
Algiers, Tunis & Tripoli.
But if, by your confidential & secret conferences with the Consul of
France, you should find, that, in aJl probability, a Treaty can not be
by any means effected, at the time when you may be a t Algiers,
within the limits before alluded to, you
carefully abstain from
making any propositions or overtures whatsoever, and appear as a

rivate Person, who, under Sanction of a Flag of Truce, is the bearer of
Etters &9 - And, after having gained all the information you can
acquire from the Consul of France & other Persons friendly to the
interests of the United States, you will come to Lisbon, as expeditiously
as may be, in order to our prosecuting the farther measures proper to
be pursued, in this thorny business; in consequence of the m a n g e
ments which shall in the mean time have been made in France. Bs
you will perceive, from what has already been intimated, that we have
great reason to expect the friendly and efficaciousco-operation of the
French Republic in our Barbary negotiations, & particularly with those
States, where we have not hitherto had Treaties established; you will
be pleased to keep this expectation constantly in mind, and act entirely with the privity & concert of the Agents or Consuls of that
Republic accordmgly.
In case of forming a Provisional Treaty, it is wished that it may be as
nearly conformable to the Draught herewith delivered to you as the
circumstances will &ow. But we must acquiesce with having the
negociation terminate in the liberation of our Citizens & a Treaty
of Peace & Friendship only, if nothing farther can be obtained.
Philip Sloan, who is lately returned from captivity in Algiers, & who
appears to be well acquainted with the Dey, will attend you as Interpreter and Messenger, and be employed in such manner as you shall
judge advisable: - he being engaged in the service of the United
States for the purpose, at the rate of twenty Six Dollars p: Month &
his expences; which you will be pleased to pay from the fund allotted
therefor in the next Article
During the time you may be employed on this Agency (that is to
say, previous to your commencing to act under your Commission as
Consul for Tunis or Tripoli) you will be allowed by the United States
at the rate of one hundred Dollars pr Month & our expences. A
Credit on M' James Simpson, Consul of the United tates at Gibralter,
is herewith given to you for the pay & expences of yourself & Philip
Sloan: who has received his monthly pay to the first of June next. The circumstances of the United States require such aconomy as may
consist with conveniencey, decency & propriety, and which is accordingly recommended. At the same time, lt is dso requested that the
Statement of your Account together with the Vouchers for Expenditures, should be as accurate, clear & satisfactory as possible.
I t will not escape your attention that the greatest possible secrecy
ought to be preserved. I t is requested that you will keep the Secretary
of State (if you should have good opportunities of writing direct1 to
him) and myself, as fully advised of your proceedings, as the
culties of conveyance and other circumstances may permit: taking the
best precautions to prevent any important events relating to Barbarg
afTairs from falling into the possession of the Individuals or the Agenta
of Nations, not friendly to our interests. You are therefore authorised
to incur such expences on account of the
States in em loying

As to the first, I think I can tell nearly what a Peace will cost; that
is to say, to the Dey himself 200,000 Piastres fortes of Spain. to the
Treasury (either in Money paid in hand, or timber for construction)
50,000 Dollars-to t.he first Lords & the Relations of the Dcy 100,000Consulnr Present in Jewels, Cloths &9 to the value of 30,000 - the
Redemption of all the Slaves from 200, to 250,000 Dollars - in the
whole between 6 & 700,000 Piastres fortes - and every year a Present
of Ammunition or of Timber for Construction to the value of 25 to
30,000 Piastres fortes - and also, every two years, a Consular Present
to the amount of about 9 or 10,000 Dollars.

The Sum lately appropriated by Law, by the Legislature of the
United States of America, for Barbary Affairs is 800,000 Dollars. Deducting from this Sum the probable diminution, by transmitting
& converting a Loan of a particular description into hard Money the application of a part of it (according to Instructions) to the other
Barbary States - together with the possrble loss of Exchange or cost
of transferrence - it will then remain to be ascertained how far the
Nett amount of the appropriation to this particular object, may correspond with the preceding Est.imate. In case of success, it would be extremely interesting for us to know,
whether Bills on Leghorn, Gibrtilter, Cadiz, Lisbon, or any commercial Place will answer the purpose, or whether Dollars must
actual1y be transported to Algiers.

SIR. After you shall have received the necessary advices now espected from Barbary, You will proceed as expeditiously as may be
to Tangier, or such other Port in the Empire of Morocco as you shall
judge most convenient for carrying into effect the Agency committed
to yo11. In accomplishing this business (as defined in the authentic
Documents & Powers herewith put into your hands) You will endeavour to c o n h e the expenditure, in addition to the Arms, Military
Stores & other Presents allotted for this purpose according to the
annexed Invoices, to as small a sum in money as the nature of the
circumstances will admit: always remembering, and, if occnsion shall
require, alledging that our circumstances are very dfferent from those
of the other Nations of the Earth. Indeed our pecuniary resources
are a t this time so limited that it would not be eligible to exceed the
small fund this day placed at your disposal by my Bills on Mess?

John Bulkeley & Son of Lisbon. In short, the less money shall be
thus applied, the better - provided the business can be effected, as
I hope it may by means of the Presents. - As economy is most
essentially requisite in all the public transactions of the United States,
and more particularly so with regard to all transactions with the
Barbary States in order to avoid improper Precedents for the future.
I t is hoped & believed that the little Supply of Arms & Military
Stores will be particularly useful & agreeable to his Imperial Majesty.
Even this little Present has the merit of being the result of more
exertion than might be supposed, as we have but too much occasion
for such articles ourselves on account of our war with the Natives of
America. But conceiving that such articles would be peculiarly acceptable to the Emperor in his present situation, we have notwithstanding the inconvenience to ourselves spared them accordingly, and
hope as a token of our hearty good will they may tend, very much
to conciliate his particular friendship for the United States. In the
distribution of the other Presents, you must be governed in a great
degree by your own knowledge of the Country & the Customs prevalent on similar occasions: a t the same time endeavouring to avail
yourself of the experience of others, and especially to obtain such
information from the Swedish & Danish Consuls as to the best mode
of proceeding, as may render your conduct most honorable to yourself & beneficial to the United States.
On a former occasion, it was suggested to the late M; Tho-arclay,
that, in the distribution of Presents, he would treat Francisco Chiappe
(who was thought to have deserved well of the United States & who
had exhibited an Account of 394 Dollars of expenditures against them)
so liberally as not only to cover that demand, but to go beyond it in
such a manner as to fix him deeply in our interest. This, however,
to be done without recognising the Account, as our Laws oppose the
application of Money so informally. To other Persons who might
have claims, or pretend to have them, without having been in any
manner employed, i t was not judged advisable to pay the same regard.
To these original instructions I request your attention. The reason
originally assigned, being, "the money which would make one good
friend, divided among many would produce no attachment".
You will be pleased to exhibit as clear a Statement as possible
(with such Cerhficates or Vouchers as the nature of the business will
admit) of the application of all the public Money or Property put
into your charge for the purposes of your present Agency.
You will be allowed by the United States of Arnenca all the necessary expences attending the transaction of this business, and a t the
rate of one hundred Dollars pr Month while employed upon it.
The form of the Treaty, Act or Instrument of recognition, by which
his Imperial Majesty Muley Soliman will renew or recognise the
Treaty made by the United States of Ameiica with his father Sidi
Mahomet (according to the Copy of the original Treaty given to
you) may either be in conformity to the Sketch herewith delivered
to you, or of any other due form & diction which shall substantially
& effectually comprehend the same objects. That Treaty, Act or
Instrument to be forwarded to me by the first safe conveyance, in

SIRI have to observe on M?Fox" letter to you, dated Naval Yard,

spared in laying the keels of the frigates in the best possible position
for launching: I think from his description of the ground, it will be very
proper to lower the keel abaft, in fact, to keep i t as low as possible
on the blocks, all fore and aft, as will barely admit of putting on the
false keel. If they have sdicient water for launching, I would give
the keel the same declivity as the launching ways. If the water is
scant, i t shouid be less, as described in a former letter to you on that
subject.

SIR. The report of CoI? Copperthwait, returned from his mission
to Georgia, relative to the live oak to be procured for the frigates.
That i t will now take one year to complete the quantity wanted,
induces me to change the plan of sending pmtial supplies to all the
six Na
yards. By continuing that plan, the business in every
yard J b e kept in a lingering condition, at a heavy expence, without
completing anything. Had the difEculties of getting the live oak been
foreseen - had i t been known that full and regular supplies for two
only, could be kept up - certainly, the carrying forward of 8ix
frigates a t the same time, would not have been attempted. What
should not have been begun, ought now that the facts are known, to
be laid aside. Consequently I shall direct four of the Constructors
to suspend their labours, or to dismiss all their hands for whom they
cannot find conatant, and useful employment. Here I refer to any
unwrought timber on hand, and to what may be expecbd by them
in the vessels which shall be loaded wholly, or in part, when these
new orders shall reach Mr Morgan, for their respective yards. If
indeed, they should have on board only a mall number of timbers

104

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1785 TO 1801

(say about a dozen, in any one vessel) which have been already
supplied to the two yards which are to be kept o en, they may be
i those of
sent to one or the other of those two yards - w%
ch are
Philadelphia, and Baltimore. Those few surplus sticks may be reshipped, with any other surplus timber, to New York, and Norfolk. Philadelphia and Baltimore are preferred for continuing the work,
because those ports, especially the former, are the most likely to be
cut off from winter supplies, by means of ice.
Besides the saving of expence by changing the plan as now proposed,
other advantages may arise. Two frigates may be completed many
months before the whole, if carried on together, could be finished;
and should there be a call for their service, they might be equipped,
and sent to sea, while the rest were progressing. - Some errors may
be committed in the construction of the first frigates; or improvements
suggested. Then in the residue, the errors may be avoided, and the
improvements adopted. You wiU now be pleased to give the requisite
orders for the live oak procuring for the frigates in conformity with
the ideas here expressed; including in your orders the pine beams, and
plank intended for the frigate building at Philadelphia.

Tangier & Cdiz, containing detail of occurrences up to that time. I have now to request you will be pleased to acquaint His Excell?
the President, that Sidy Mohamet Ben Ottman, having on the morning of the 18'? laid before Muley Soliman, translation of the Treaty
made with his Father; he sent me a message same Afternoon by His
Majestys order, desiring to know "what sum it would be agreeable
"to the United States of America, to pay him annually." - After
the assurances of Muley Soliman, in the letters written since the
Month of October last, by bis order, of which you have seen translations, and his declaration in the public meshooar on the 9" Ins!, such
a message would scarce have been listen'd to as serrious, by any other,
than n erson already accustomed to such inconsistent proceeding,
in this ountry; - on this occasion i t gave me the most poignant
concern. - I instantly waited on the Secretary of State, and in consequence of a very long conference with him,wrote the letter of which
I have the honor of submitting to His Excell7 the Presidents perusal
the accompanying copy - This letter with a translation in Arabic,
which I thought well to accompany it with, were laid before the
Emperor on the 20" by Sidy Mohamet Ben Ottman; who has aince
assured me, he dwelt on those passages most likely to have weight
with the Emperor, towards enducing him to ratify the old Treaty;
but after pausing a short time, he was pleased to say, "as the American
"will not agree to pay any thing yearly, he must get ready to
"return from whence he came, and on his way see Mule Taib." This determination was conveyed to me same evening, a ter which I
had a farther conferrence with the Minister, who assured me the
Emperor was determined not to see me again unless I would previously allow him to say, I would treat for a Peace, subject to pay-

105

ment of a Subsidy, a thing I saw myself in no shape authorised to do,
of course assured him I could not treat on any such terns; and I
gladly hope the lettar written on the subject, as well as my subsequent adherence t.0 the sentiments therein held forth, will meet
approbation. Early on the 21" I was called upon to give my determination, in
consequence of His Majestys Resolution, which was of course an
acquiessence to his pleasure of my retiring from hence; - I was
induced to do so in explicit terms, because the Cheif Alcayde conducted
me hither, came at same moment, to say he had received directions to
accompany me on my return. - A firm and determined conduct, I
have always found best with the people of this Count , as a shadow
of the reverse is construed into what best suits themse ves.
Aware on this occasion however, that an immediate retreat, would
have exposed the American Flag to danger, and desirous of having a
little more time to consider what was best to be done, I sought to
ward that blow, by solliciting permission from the Emperor to go to
Gibraltar by Sea; because of the inconveniency of travelling by land,
in the present excessive hot season, knowing a t same time no opportunity then offered. - At a subsequent conferrence with the Minister that day, whom I have endeavour'd to make our F'reind, it was
thought advlseable to defer my departure, to afford opportunity for
the Freinds of the true Interests of the Emperor, to endeavour to
prevail on h i to adhere to the old Treaty; and for that purpose 1
sent notice to His Majesty, that the matter of Subsidy wm what had
never been thought of on our part, so of consequence I could not have
taken Coll Humphreys sentunents or oppinion upon the subject;
and being highly desirous of compleating happily, the busyness I had
come to this Country on, I signrfied my having no objection to take
the Collonels oppinion upon His Majestys demand, before I quitted
the Country, whlch met his entire approbation.
In consequence I immediately wrote Coll Humphreys a full statement of the matter, and sent a Young Man I brought with me from
offer'd for Faro: - I now
Gibraltar with the letter, by an opport~~nity
wait the answer, which I am satisfied will be not to listen to the proposed terms - in the mean time I have not failed to take those
meaaures necessary for guarding against accidents a t the issue, in
case of the worst. - You will no doubt remark in the latter part of
the Emperors resolution, a kind of opening left for farther Treaty with
Muley Taib, but I have the best founded reasons for wishing to avoid
that, and finish the busyness here, if possible -no less thm the highest
authority for knowing, that the proposition fur the demand has been
made by Muley Solimsn of a Subsidy, positively came from that
Prince: and I have equaly good proof that the h t Idea given his
Highness on the subject, was by that unworthy Man John Lamb; who
for the trivial object of obtaining permission to ship some horses,
flatter'd the Prince at Larach in May last, with the assurance that the
United States would pay Morocco twenty thousand dollars annually,
for a, Peace: -it is some time since I laid all this unfortunate busyness
of Lambs open to Coll Humphreys, but should not have troubled you
with it, had I not now consider'd it necesgasg. - I have not been
neglectfull in these five days past., to a v d of the means put in my
ower for makeing Freinds here, amongst those people whom I know
gave the beet opportumties of b e q usefull on this occasion; and

r

henceforward untill I receive Coll Humphreys answer, I shall take
every means for prepairing his Majesty, for the renewed attempt,
must then, I expect be made for solliciting his agreeing to Peace with
the United States, on the terms I have already proposed. - Permit
me Sir on this occasion, with due respect and defference, to urge the
grand necessity there is, for the Flag of the United States being seen
in these Seas, in such force as to command Respect; - even part of
the Frigates you have building, with some Tenders, or smaller Vessels,
would be found perfectly sufficient, under prudent Commanders for
every purpose of that nation both within, & without the Straits: here they need only be seen, there i t may be necessary for them to act

SIR I have the honor to acquaint you, that the Peace which has
hitherto happily subsisted between the Empire of Morocco and the
United States of America, has this day been confirmed by His Imperial
Majesty Muley Soliman, in terms of the Treaty made with his late
Father a t Morocco, in the year 1786.
[SDA. CL, Gibraltar, Vol. I, April 1791-Dec. 1795.1
To Secretary of State from James Simpson, U. S. Consul, Gibraltar, and Agent at
Tangier

RHABAT,
Augzcst 18,1796.
SIE:I have at last the happiness to acquaint you, and request you

will be pleased to inform His Excellency the President, that this
morning, by appointment, I attended his Imperial Majesty Muley
Soliman, at Meshooar, when he was leased to say to me in public,
nearly as follows: "The Americans, find, are the Christian nation
my father, who is in glory, most esteemed. I am the same with them
as my fatber was; and I trust they will be so with me. I have given
orders to Sid Ben Ottman to write my answer to tbeir letter, which
will be given to you, and to tell them I am upon the same footing
with them as my father was."
I did not fail to assure his Majesty that the United States would,
on their part, be equally emulous to maintain that peace and ood
friendship wbich had so happily subsisted between them a n t his
father. His Majesty came out of the palace on horseback; and immediately after the recited conversation, proceeded for Mequinez

P

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS

107

and Fez. The Secretary of State, who remains a few days to give
the Swedish ambassador and myself our despatches, bas assured me
the letter for the President shall be written immediately; and as he is
also entrusted with His Majesty's seal, there needs be no delay. My
next will, of consequence, convey the original, or translation, as the
conveyance may appear to be secure.
From what I have said, you will readily observe that all I shall
(to appearance) obtain will be a letter from Muley Soliman, declarato of his being on the same terms of peace with the United States
as'K,s father was.
I a m sorry that the resistance made to my solicitations of a recognition of the old treaty, in form, has been spun out to the last hour of
the Emperor's being here, and that I have thereby been prevented
from exerting the powerful interest I had happily raised, for accomplishing, in a more satisfactory manner, the end of my mission;
though I trust the promised letter will be expressive of what is in fact
wished to be established, namely, that peace shall subsist between
Morocco and the United States, as in the time of Sidi Mahomet,
which, in my opinion, will fully answer the purpose of keeping peace
during the present reign, and of resisting any unpleasant demands,
should succeeding emperors make such.
Muley Solirnan's sudden departure for Fez is difFerently accounted
for. Some allege he is gone purposely with the army to quell some
disturbances which have lately happened in the vicmity of that city
and Mequinez; others, that i t is the consequence of the defeat the
troops he sent to the southward, under Muley Cadour, have sustained. In my opinion, both occurrences have their part in it, and
that he will not, for the present, contest with his brother, Muley
Ishem, the possession he certainly enjo s of the country south of the
Morbeya. The gwrison of Mazagar ave quitted that fortress as
untenable, and are expected here by sea.

The treaty is written in excellent Turkish and doea not show any sign of being a
translation from an Arabic original.
It seems that the laat page of Turkish text of the document waa originally the
beginning of the treaty, for i t contains the preambulary stipulations to the articles
of the treaty, aa is also the case in the treaty with Algiers of 1816 (Document 37).
Accordingly the translation begins with those introductory clauses.)
[Translation]

Reason for the Drawing Up of the Peace Treaty with the American People
The reason for the drawing up of this treaty and the motive for the writing of
this convention of good omen, is that on Saturday, the twenty-first day of the
month of Safar of this year 1210,' there have been negotiations for a treaty of
peace between the ruler and commander of the American people, living in the
island called America among the isles of the ocean, and the frontier post of the
holy war, the arrison of Algiers. To this purpose hss been appointed as his
Ambamdor,a foseph Donaldson, who has, in confirmation of the articles and
paragraphs of the present treaty, strengthened the mutual friendship and good
understanding in the exalted presence of His Excellency the noble Vizier and powerful Marshal who sits on the throne of lordship, the destructor of tyranny and
injustice and the protector of the country, Hassan Paaha-may God grant to
him what he wishes; and in the presence of all the members of the Divan, of the
chiefs of the victorious garrison, and of the victorious soldiers. This peace treaty
h a been concluded, together with the contractual promise to give annually to
the garrison of Algiers 12,000 Algerian gold pieces, provided that, in equivalence
of these 12,000 gold pieces, being the price of the peace, there may be ordered and
imported for our garrison and our arsend, powder, lead, iron, bullets, bombshells,
bomb stones, gun stones, masts, poles, yards, anchor chains, cables, sailcloth, tar,
pitch, boards, beams, laths, and other necesssries, provided that the price of all the
ordered articles shall be accounted for, so that, if this is equal to 12,000 gold pieces,
i t shall be all right, but if the price of the articles is higher, i t shall be paid to them,'
and if there remains something to our credit, they promise to complete it. If,
before the conclusion of our peace, our vessels of war have captured vessels of the
said nation, these shall not be restored and shall remain our prizes, but if our war
vessels capture one of their ships after the date of the conclusion of the peace
treaty, it is promised that this ship shall be given back.
All this has been put down in the present document, which shall be consulted
whenever needed and according to which both parties shall act.

or merchant vesaels belonging to Algiers, and they become known to each other,

hinder the other from wending its own way with honor and respect. Also, that
whatever kind of travelers there are on board, and wherever they go with their
goods, their valuables, and other properties, they shnll not molest each other or
take anything from each other, nor take them to a certain place and hold them up,
nor injure each other in any way.
21 Safar, 1210.
ARTICLE4.
The statements of the fourth article are that if war vessels of Algiers meet

Further, that if war vessels of the American ruler meet with war veseela or
merchant vessels of Algiers, and these vessels are in possession of a passport
delivered by the ruler of Algiers or the American Consul residing in Algiers,
nobody may touch anything belonging to the said vessel, but it shall wend its
way in peace.
Further, that the war vessels of Algiers, large or small, shall not touch Americana
not possessed of American paasporta within a period of eighteen months after the
date of the passports given by reason of the peace treaty and after the date of the
peace treaty', and they shall not hinder them from going their way. Equally, if
the war vessels of the American ruler meet with Algerian ships, they shall not
prevent them from continuing their journey in the same way, within a period of
eighteen months, but they shall wend peacefully their way.
Further that our frlend the American ruler shall not give a pawport to any
crew not being under his rule and not belonging to his own people; if an American
passport is found in the hands of a crew not belonging to his own people, we shall
take them ss prize, for this is not covered by the stipulations of this p a c e treaty.
This has been expressly stated in this article in order to prevent A. rupture of peace;
so it shall not be neglected.
21 Safar, 1210.
ARTICLE5.
The statements of the fifth article are that none of the captains of Algerian
ships or of their officers or commanders shall take anybody by force from American
ships into their own ships or bring such a person to other places, that they shall

people they may be; as long as these are on American ships, they shall not molest
them.
21 Safar, 1210.
ARTICLE6.

ever.
21 Safar, 1210.
NOTES
The original of this treaty is in Turkish, not in Arabic as stated in the proclamation. The articles which are written in English on pages of the original document
are a translation, signed by Joseph Donaldson, jr., who negotiated the treaty a t
Algiers.
There is an interesting account of the negotiations, entitled "Narrative of $he
proceedings of Jose h Donaldson Esqv," written by Richard O'Brien, afterwards
Consul General a t XIgiers, in D. S., 1 Archives, Tunis, 1793-1801 (a volume from
the consular archives a t Tunis), where O'Brien gives this account of himself:
Late Master of the Ship Dau hin, of Philadelphia, but was Captured the 30'P of
July 1785, fifty leagues to tho h a t w a r d of Lisbon, by an Algerine Corsair of 34

Guns & 450 men-& Remained i n Captivity until1 the 11th of September 1795
Redeemed in Consequence, of the Peace made by the United States, with Algiers.
The report of Donaldson on the treaty, dated September 7, 1795 (D. R., 1
Consular Despatches, Algiers), is somewhat confused and in certain respects
obscure; but he mentions that the text was in Turkish, saying that James Leander
Cathcart, who was one of the American captives and was chief Christian clerk of
the Dey of Algiers, "returned to me with Articles of s Treaty in Turkish & then
Englished, which Proves to be that of the Sweedes." The Swedish treaty here
referred to h the Treaty of Peace and @mmerce with Algiers of April 25/May 5,
1792, which was a renewal, with additrons, of a treaty of April 5/16, 1729. For
the Swedish text and a French translation, see Von Martens, Recueil des principaux trait&, 1st ed., VI, 296-311; 2d ed., V, 316-31. The substance of each of
the respective twenty-two articles of the Swedish and American treaties is in
general similar.
The date of the treaty is stated above in the two calendars according to the
original documents, namely, Saturday, September 5,1795, and 21 M a r , A. E. 1210.
According to the chronological tables the Mohammedan date corresponds to
September 6, 1795; however, the mention of the day of the week (see the opening
phrase of the translation of 1930) fixes the date definitively, and in this case there
is no doubt that 21 Safar, A. a. 1210, answers to September 5, 1795. From the
report of Donddson above mentioned i t appears that the money bargain, to which
the negotiations in reality wholly related, was struck on Saturday, September 5,
and the treaty was delivered by Cathcart to Donddson "the next morning."

(7 September 17951
Instructions to Joel Berlow, U. 6. Agent, Algiers, from David Humphreys, U. 6.
Yhbter to Lisbon, Portugal, and in charge of negotiations with Berbary
Powers

COPY
(Secret & coddentid)
SIR. The French Republic having lately agreed to make use of its
influence in favour of the negotiations of the United States for Peace
$ 9 with the Barbary Powers, it becomes indispensable on our part to
take the most prompt, prudent & effectual measures in our power for
availing ourselves of the same. Upon the conference of the Minister
Plenipotentiary of the U. S. t o the French Republic, with the Cornmissioner of exterior Relations & the Members of the Committee of
public Safety charged with that part of the Department of exterior
Relations which respects the Barbary States, it is judged essentiall
for the interests of the U. S. that a Citizen of the said
States s ould be appointed to proceed immediately from hence to
&era.
The object of this arrangement, is, that the Person so
appointed should be charged with the special Instructions of the Goyernment of the French Republic to the Agents or Consuls of the m d
Republic in Barba
(particular1 in Algiers, Tunis & Tripoh) to
employ all the goo offices 8 d u e n c e of the Republic with those

8

'B

118

Powers, for the purpose of effecting a Pacification between them &
United States. For the accomplishment of this object you are
appointed: and you are moreover invested with full Powers on the part
of the United States (either solely, or in conjunction with Joseph
Donaldson Junior, to whom from partievlar considerations provisional
Instructions have already been given) to enter into a negotiation with
the Dey & Regency of Algiers and to conclude a Treaty of Peace
between them & the U. S., as well as a Treaty for the liberation of the
Citizens of the U. S. in captivity a t Algiers. In order that you may
be fully acquainted with the particular considerations before alluded
to, as well as with the present position of our affairs in regard to the
Barb
Powers beforementioned (so far as facts are known) I conceiveycannot do better than to furnish you (as I do herewith) with
Copies of all the Instructions which have been given to Joseph Donaldson Junr on the subject. From those Documents you will perceive
the unequivocal dispositions of our own Government, and the firm
reliance placed by us on the friendly & efficacious co-operation of the
French Republic, together with the frankness & good faith with which
our proceedings have been directed. On the general principles contained in those Instructions you will likewise act. As our Government has an unbounded confidence in the sincere desire of the French
Republic to yield effectual assistance towards our attainment of the
beforementioned objects; it is especially wished to be impressed u on
your mind, in the strongest manner, that the whole business, in alf' its
stages, ought to be carried on with the most perfect good faith, intelligence & concert with the Government of the French Republic.
All the particular arrangements with respect to your route, place
of embarkation & manner of co-operation are left to your discretion.
However, if no obstacles or objections (at present unforeseen) should
occur, it is 'udged that it would be eligible, on several accounts, which
have alre y been verbally communicated to you, for you to proceed
by the way of Alicante.
The cordial interposition of the French Republic in our behalf, and
the actual provision of funds by our Government to enable us to comly with such necessary stipu[lations] as may be made, place the
{usineas on a very d l e r e n t footing from what it has ever hitherto
been; and give us far greater reason to expect success than any other
circumstances, would have afforded. I t seems now to be the moment
for deciding, once for all, whether our means & the mediation of our
Ally, can offer sufficiently powerful motives to induce the Dey &
Regency to treat with us or not. - I have no doubt that yourself &
your Colleague, deeply impressed with a conviction of the great utility
to France as well as to the U. 8. of opening the Navigation of the
Mediterranean to our vessels, and animated with the lively hope of
being instrumental in delivering our fellow Citizens at Algiers from
the miseries of captivity, will exert every nerve for the accomplishment of those most desirable & important objects.
I n all possible events, it will doubtless be a great consolation to our
unfortunate fellow Citizens who are groaning in chains a t Algiers, to
be. convinced themselves, as well as to have i t known to their sym atlusing Countrymen a t home, & to the whole human Race, t at
nothing within the limit of the abilities of the United States, has been

I have requested the Dey as well as Hadge AIy to Propose a truce

SIR:By the direction of the President of the United States, I have
the honor to present, herewith, a report of the progress made in providing materials for the frigates, and in building them,
And am, most respectfully, sir, your obedient servant,

TIMOTHY
PICKEBING.

The VICE PRESIDENT
of the U. S.
and PRESIDENT
of the SENATE.
A statement of the progress in providing materirrle for the frigates, and in

building them
If the frigates had been constructed with the timber a t hand in the several
places where they were destined to be built, they might by this time have been
completed. But the design of rendering them permanently useful having determined the Executive to have them constructed with live oak and cedar, the
measures deemed necessary and adequate to the procuring of those materiala
were taken during the last year. The common and easy acquisition of those
articles for the ordinary service of the merchants forbade any a prehension of
extraordinary difficulty in procuring the same for the frigates. g u t in the experiment i t has been found, that timber of the bngths and sizes necessary for
frigate, was greatly dispersed, and grew generally in places difficult of access,
and required extraordinary means of transportation to the landing. The natural
difficulties of the country have been increased by unusual quantities of rain. Ship
cerpenters were sent from the Northern States to the islands bearing the live
oak, and employed during the last winter in cutting and hewing the timber: but
the c l i i t e deterred them from staying to proeecute their work; so that three
men only, capable of selecting the proper timber and moulding i t in the requisite
forms, have been prevailed on to remain. These, with negro laborers, have eontinued the work, and are still employed. With these, however, i t wae jud ed
practicable to procure the whole of the Live oak timber by the month of
1796. Such was the report of an intelligent agent employed in Georgia dunng
the lsst winter, and who has now returned hither to superintend, and, 8s far
possible, to expedite, the operations.
Upon this report, made in June last, it was judged eligible to concentre the
efforts that were making to furnish the yards w ~ t hhve oak timber, and sccordingly ordera were given to accumulate at two of the ysr& so much of i t as would
be necessary ta complete two frigates by the enauing 8pring. But before these
orcould reach the manager, s e v e d veasels were despatched to different
yards; and one was cast away and her cargo l&.
&me difficulty occurred in
procuring proper vessels to transport the timber: several of those which had made
one voyage having encountered such hardships and eicknass an to be deterred
from making a second.

dY,

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS

123

Nevertheless, under all these embarrassments, the work is continued, and
with the well grounded expectation, before expressed, that all the live oak timber
will be cut and tramported to the different ship yards a t farthest by the next
midsummer.
Details of the quantities of timber and other materials already provided, and
of the progress in building, will appear in the annexed schedules. The live oak
and white oak timber mentioned are generally or wholly moulded and dre88ed
and ready for raising.
Since draughting the foregoing report, a letter has been received from the
chief carpenter employed in procuring timber in Georgia, presenting a very
favorable account of his progress. Two vessels laden with live oak had recently
sailed for the two yards of Philadelphia and Baltimore, and the rest of the timber
to complete the frames of the frigates building a t those places was cut and ready
to be shipped. These were the two frigates which, as before mentioned, it was
proposed first to finish. The chief carpenter adds, that if he is furnished with
vessels fit for the service, he will have all the timber in the six yards in the month
of May next, excepting the knees, all of which he thinks cannot be got of live
oak. The agent who engages the vessels for transporting the timber hm no
doubt of procuring timely all that will be wanted for the service.
Sail cloth has been provided for one suit of sails for each of the frigate. It
was contracted for, and manufactured in the United States, in the year 1794.
I t haa been proposed to procure one kind of foreign cloth, of a superior quality,
for the second suit: but the purchase haa been suspended, to avoid an expenditure of money until it could be ascertained a t what time the cloth would actually
be wanted to equip the frigates. For the like reason, no more hemp has been
purctmed than will be required for the cordage of the two frigates the building
of which i t was intended to advance in preference to the others; and which i t
was then hoped would be constructed by the close of the ensuing spring. For
the same cause, the number of anchors which will eventually be required remains
incomplete.
All which is respectfully submitted to the Senate of the United States.

Report, kc. agreeably to a request of a committee of the House of
Representatives of the United Strttes, appointed to inquire into the
state of the Naval Equipment, viz:
To the first inquiry, I am of opinion that, on the most minute
calculation that I can possibly make or procure, from a general
consultation of the different persons concerned in the building and
equipment of the frigates, that their actual cost, when completed,
w1t.h ordnance and ordnance stores, including powder, k c . (but without being provisioned or manned) will be one hundred and twenty
dollars per ton. That the four forty-four gun ships will tonnage,
according to the new mode of measurement adopted by the carpenters
of this port, six thousand eight hundred and fifty-two tons, and that
the two ships of thirty& guns wiU tonnage two thousand six hundred
and sixty-six tons.
Consequently the six frigates will measure nine thousand five
hundred and eighteen tons, which, at the rate of one hundred
and twenty dollars, aforesaid, will cost ------------ $1,142,160

In the accompanying paper, No. 2, is s n account of all money disbwsed, or paid to the different agents and purveyor of supplies,
including the sum of ------ dollars, remitted to our minister in
England, for the purpose of purchasing copper and sundry other
materials, and will be accounted for by them, respectively.
No. 3 wilt show the materials on hand, and No. 4, such as are still
wanting in the yards and stores; many of which are procured and will
be speedily received.
No. 5 is an estimate of the further sum supposed to be necessrtry to
completely equip one forty-four and one thirty-six gun frigate, lf the
others should be discontinued.
From the present arrangements that are made, and apparent propect, i t is expected that the six frigates may be b d t , launched, and
completely equipped, in the course of the present year; and that one
fourty-four and one thirty-six may be completed with great ease by

United States against the Algerines, then a t war with the United
States; that four of the frigates should carry forty-four guns, each,
the two others thirty-six guns, each. By this law it was enacted,
that, in case of a peace with Algiers, no further proceeding should be
had under the said act.
That, on the 9th of June ensuing, an act passed, appropriating six
hundred and eighty-eight thousand eight hundred and eighty-eight
dollars and eighty-two cents, for the purpose of carrying on the
building and equipping of the six frigates ordered by the preceding
law; and the sum of eighty thousand dollars was appropnated, by
the said act, for the building of galleys or other vessels, as the President
of the United States might direct; the above sum of six hundred and
eighty-eight thousand eight hundred and eighty-eight dollars and
eighty-two cents, a t the time of passing the act, was thought would
be sutficient to build and e uip the said frigates; and they might
have been built and equippe in one year, if common materials had
been put together, and the size of the frigates had not been extended.
But it appears to your committee, that, after the law passed, the
President of the United States, under whose direction they were to

1

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS

129

be built, deemed it most advisable to extend the size of the frigates,
and determined that they should be near three hundred tons la er,
each, than the committee who reported on the naval armament ad
estimated; that, instead of making use of common timber for building
the frigates, he caused the best live oak and red cedar to be got in
Georgia, from whence i t was to be exported to the different naval
yards, established under his direction, a t the following places, viz.
one at Portsmouth in Virginia, one a t Baltimore, one a t Philadelphia,
one a t New York, one st Boston, and one a t Portsmouth in New
Hampshire; a t which places much of the timber has arrived, more is
daily expected, and the whole is probably contracted for, and may be
expected in the different yards by May or June next; as may more
fully appear by a letter from the Secretary of the Department of
War, received the fourteenth of December last, to which the committee beg leave to refer.
Your committee further report, that, from the best information
they can obtain, in consequence of the increased size of the frigates,
the additional expense of live oak and red cedar timber, and the
unexampled rise of labor, provisions, and all other articles necessary
to the equipment of ships of war, since March, 1794, when the law
was passed for providing a naval armament, that the cost of the six
frigates, exclusive of provisions and men's wages, when equipped for
sea, will amount to one million one hundred and fifty-two thousand
one hundred and sixty dollars; hence, if they are to be completed,
they will require the further sum of four hundred and fifty-three
thousand two hundred and seventy-two dollars-a sum, in the opinion
of the committee, which i t would be inexpedient to apply to this
object, whilst labor, provisions, &c. &c. remain a t the present advanced prices; and as the committee are of opinion that many of the
articles on hand may be preserved a long time without injury, and
such as are of a perishable nature may be sold without loss, if not to
advantage; and as the primary cause for which the six frigates were
to be built is probably accomplished, although the committee reluctantly give up the idea of finishing the whole for the present, are of
opinion that two of the frigates, one of forty-four uns, and one of
thirty-six guns, should be finished as soon as possib e; which, in the
opinion of the committee, may be effected with the money already
appropriated, and completed by November next. Therefore,
Resolced, As the opinion of this committee, that, as there is a peace
with the Emperor of Morocco, and good reason to believe that there
is one with Algiers, that only two of the six frigates should be completed a t present, and that as speedily as possible; and that the
President of the United States should be authorized to dispose of such
part of the materials procured, as may be of a perishable nature, after
reserving a sufficiency to complete one frigate of forty-four guns,
and one of thirty-six guns. That the surplus be secured in the best
manner the nature of the case will admit, to be rfeady whenever Congress may deem i t advisable to direct the fi~lishngof the other four
frigates.
Resolved, As the opinion of this committee, that the surplus moneys
appropriated for bullding of frigates, after completing two of them,
should be applied to the sinking fund, for the reduction of the public
debt.

H o d SIR- Give me leave to inform you that on the evening of

the 28'? of Jan? the Spanish Packet arived here, which brought y.p
of the 14th of Deer informing us of your having dispatchd OBrien in
the Brig [Sophia] to London &g I immediately conjectured that this
transaction would take up more time than the Dey would allow for
Cornpleating our affairs, & consulted hfonsr Slijoldebrand on the subject, when u-e mutually agreed that the prudentest step to take would
be to inform his Excellency of the difficulty's which had arose in raising
the money in Lisbon & at the same time to make him a small present
in yr name, informing him that you had gven Yr assent to all Mr
Donaldsons transactions? but that the affairs of Europe were so embroil'd a t present you found i t difficult to raise so large a sum immediately, but that his Excell? might depend you were doing every
thing in.yr power to have the money forwarded as fast as possible,
this we Mrnagined was the only way we could adopt to gain time as
the Deys patience is nearly exhausted, & the enernles of our Country
are continuall~ltaking advantage of every delay in order to render
the Dey & Divan unfavourable to our cause & favourable to the
Portuguese who actually has agreed on Terms with the Dey for a
Peace & Redemption of their Captives, as the Dey's Broker has
infom'd me in confidence, & that Don Juan Garigo the private
Agent for Portugal has forwarded his dispatches with these in order
to have a person sent here from the Court of Portugal to Ratify said
agreement, whom he expects wiU be dispatched in a Frigate on the
Arival of said Dispatches -

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS

133

Mt Donaldson said he could not think of making any more presents
to the Dey as he had no Orders for so doing & had actually exceeded
his Orders all ready, the consequence of which was that on the 299
a t 2 P M the Dey sent for me and interrogated me relative to the
News, Mr Donaldson had recq by the Packet, I inform'd his Excellency of the particulars painting every thing m the most favourable
light, but the present was wanting in order to strengthen the Dey's
beleif and to persuade him we were sincere which he seems much to
doubt, he accordingly discredited every thing I inform'd him of &
told me the Agents of the U S were trifling with him, & notwithstanding that I tryed every means practicable to persuade him to the cont r a y , he order'd me to inform M': Donaldson that he expected our
a f f m would be entirely compleated in one month from the arival
of the Packet, otherwise he should consider every thing we had
allready done to be void and would treat us as a set of Imposters,
that he would order all the Americans that are now exempt from
labour down to the Marine in their former stations & order M' Donaldson immediately out of the Country & would never admit of another
Negociator on the part of the U. States
I informed the Dev that it was im~ossibleour affairs could be settled
in one month from &.is date and big7dof him to grant a longer space
this he denied * * *
Since the 29!b of January I have solicited the favour & interference
of many of the Grandees of this Regency who has promised to use their
influence with the Dey in our favour which I hope will produce a good
effect, as his Excellency has since said that if the American Ambassador
at Lisbon could not have procured the whole sum at once, that had he
sent but one half or even a third of the Sum exacted he would be content as that would persuade him the Americans were sincere & intended to fullfill their agreement, but to his Sirprize five months had
elaps'd with out receiving the least assurance of our Treaty being
ratded nor even a line from the Ambassador empowr'd with the
management of Barbary affairs a t Lisbon This Sir is a true Statement of our affairs at pest & have no more to

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS

To Joel Barlow, U. S. Agent, Algiers, from David Humphreys, U. 8. Minister to
Lisbon, Portugal, and in charge of negotiations with Barbary Powers

LISBONFebT 16"P 1796
MY DEARSIR: I wrote to you on the l* instant, acknowledging
the receipt of your letter of the 23d of Dec' and advising you to remain
a t Alicant, until ou should hear farther from me. I now write to
ou by M! Rob: bontgomery, as I at that time intimated I should
Lave an opportunity of doing.
In the present very ill state of Mr Donaldson's health, I have
thought i t expedient for the promotion of the public Service, to name
you to ACT in the Regency of Algiers, in a Consular or other capacity
until the pleasure of Government shall be known, delegating by a
Commission of AGENCY
all the power which I might have a right to
delegate for the purpose. I have also made out new Powers of
Agency to you & Mr Donaldson, to act jointly or seperately, in the
negotiations with Tunis & Tripoli, as the circumstances may require.
Those Instruments are enclosed herewith, as also the Letters Patent
from the President of the United States, ap ointing me Commissioner
Plenipotentiary to those two States. ~ncyosedyou will also find, a
Copy of my original Instructions to Mr Donaldson on the subject of
the proposed negotiations with them: to the tenour of which attention
is stdl to be paid accordingly.
I hope the business will now be resumed under happy auspices, &
carried on under the favorable influence of the Government of the
French Republic. The reason given by M' Donaldson, Capt?
O'Brien & others, why that could not have been done a t Algiers, a t
the moment when the negotiation was concluded, is, that the French
Agent General for Barbary (Hercules) had not arrived a t that Place,
and that the actual Consul General, being aristocratically inclined,
was not very favorable to our interests, Or, at least, that he had done
things to rmse the demands of the Dey, which were already too high.
I have given these circumstances, with their authority, as the came
to me, to Mr Monroe, in order, that (if necessary) he might e able
to explain our conduct, so as to prevent unfavorable imputations, &
to demonstrate there was at least no intentional inconsistency in it.
You will find that parties prevail greatly in Algiers. - You will
have need of all your penetration - to see every thing - to watch
every body - and I am persuaded i t will require great prudence to
manaGe our affairs well, & to soothe the impatience of the Dey until
a remttance can be made to him.
I am sorry to learn by a Packet which has arrived this day, that
the Specie which was expected from England, & for which I had
sent CaptW9Brien,in a Brig belonging to the United States, cannot
be expected from thence. I apprehend the vessel will be obliged to
go to Hamburg for it. At all events, a delay of some months must
still (in all human probability) intervene, before any of the Money
can be lodged a t Algiers. I have written a letter to the Dey (in
answer to one from hun to me) stating facts, & placing the matter as
fairly as I was able, on its true grounds. For honesty, I hold, to be
the best polic . I have, a t the same time, written much more in
detail, to MI Jathcnrt, Christian Clerk to the Dey. - * * *
Mr Philip Sloan, who came from America with me as Interpreter
&" for the Barbary negotiations, bein indisposed to continue any
longer immediately connected with
Donaldaon, I have advised

g

d

136

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1786 TO 1801

him to attach himself in that capacity to you. I think you will find
him useful & intelligent in the performance of that duty. * * *
Mr Cathcart has written to me respecting tho Ransom of a Person
by the name of C a m 1 - I have always understood that it is a
Custom, in all Treaties with the Regency, to redeem one or more of
such additional Slaves, as shall be indicated b the Dey for the
p u r ~ s e . I have only to suggest, that Mr Don dson & you would
enqurre into the Customs, & govern yourselves on the occasion by
your best discretion.
M' Cathcart has dso written to me, that he has a vessel which
m @ ~ tbe obtained on reasonable terms to carry our Citizens from
era to America: - The same discretion is, however, to be cons ted in providing the means of sending the Captives, with the least
expence & in the best manner, to the United States.
P. S. The reasons why I have proposed you to the Dey, as Agent;
rather than Consul, are; because the appointment appeared to come
more naturally from the Powers with which I am myself invested;
because it will comprehend the same functions; and because, i t seems
probable, that the Dey may not expect any present wit11 this Nomination, as he might perhaps with that to a temporary Consulship.
My aaxious hope & earnest expectation, is, that Mr Donaldson &
you will be able to interest the French Agents or Consuls in Barbary,
so far in our behalf, and that the Nation may become in a manner
Guarrantee to our Treaties.
I think you will have occasion for almost infinite discernment, to
discover pretended friends from real Enemies. - I have every reason
to entertain a good opinion of the Messw Skjoldebrands. On the
contrary Bussara (Mr Montgomery's friend & Correspondent) is
represented as a dangerous foe, under the mask of friendship.
Pray endeavour to soothe & comfort our Citizens in Algiers, as
much as possible. They may with truth be assured, every thing is
doing, that can be done for them.

Excellent & Most Illustrious H&asan Bashaw, Dey of the City &

In reply to the enquiries made in your letter to me, dated the of

Credentials of Agency given to Joseph Donddson Junior, are of

the Senate, before it can become the Supreme law of the Land; that the
delay which hath occurred originated from inevitable circumstances,
beyond the foresight or controul of human recaution - as will be
more fully explained in a letter to your Exce ency's Christian Clerk;
and, finally, that all possible measures are now taking for accomplishing the Arrangements as soon as the circumstances will admit, in a
manner which i t is hoped will be satisfactory to your Excellency but still it is impossible to say, whethar a considerable time must not
ela se before the Money can possibly be collected - as neither gold
or ilver, to the amount in question, can be exported from the Place
wbere all has every assurance & reason to expect i t would have been
in readiness for us.
In the mean time, having heard of the Sickness of MT Joseph
Donaldson Junior, the present Agent at Algiers, I have thought it
expedient for the mutual interests of our two Nations to delegate
to Mr Joel Barlow all the Power of Agency which I am capable of
committing to him,in order that he ma (by the Permission of your
Execellency) be enabled to perform all t e Consular and other Public
Acts necessary to be performed for the Service of the United States,

MY DEAR SIR In consequence of letters just recQfrom Algiers b
Mr J. Montgomery & M' Sloan (probably similar to what you

to waiting the arrival of the funds, and shall sail the Â£irst fair wind.
It is now cont
, & I may be detained here on that account till
another post s a come from Lisbon. which I s h o d hope may
bring farther advice from you, as we understand from Mr R. Mont-

gomery's letter of the 16" that an English Packet had arrived, tho'
the letters were not distributed when he closed his of that date.
The situation of our &air seems critical and darning, and as I
concieve i t to be the interest as welt as the intention of the U. S. to
conclude the business a t almost any rate, I shall not hesitate to make
use of dl the means in my power to liee the treaty in suspence till
we are furnished with the funds to f u d it. The necegsity for this
becomes more pressing, as it is probable that many American vessels
are on their way to these seas in consequence of the news of the peace,
which will fall into the hands of the AIgerines the moment the negotiations are broken off.
I t seems the reason why the Dey wishes to take advantage of our
delay is on account of terms proposed or to be proposed by Portugal.
Cannot you persuade that court to act in concert with us, or a t least
not to counteract us again in fhis troublesome business. If you percieve that the money is not to come on so that the business can be
concluded, and especially if you find that peace is to be made with
Portugal, I think you should spare no expence to warn the Americans
of the Danger, so as to prevent captures as much as possible.

COMMUNICATED
TO CONGRESS,
MARCH15, 1796.
Gentlemen of the Senate and House of Representatives:
By the ninth section of the act, entitled "An act to provide a naval
armament," it is enacted "that, if a peace shall take place between
the United States and the Regency of Algiers, that no further proceedings be had under this act."
The peace which is here contemplated having taken place, i t is
incumbent upon the Executive to suspend all orders respecting the
building of the frigates, procuring materials for them, or preparing
materials already obtained, which may be done without intrenching
upon contracts or agreements made and entered into before this
event.
But, inasmuch as the loss which the public would incur might be
considerable from the dissi ation of workmen, from certain works
or operations being sudde y dropped or left unfinished, and from
the derangement in the whole system, consequent upon an immediate
suspension of all proceedings under it, I have, therefore, thought ~t
advisable, before taking such a step, to submit the subject to the
Senate and House of Representatives, that such measures may be
adopted in the premises as may best comport with the public interest.

Mr. Bingham, from the committee to whom was referred the message of the President of the United States, of the 15th instant, made
the following report:
That it is the opinion of the committee i t will be expedient to
authorize the President of the United States to cause to be completed,
with all convenient expedition, two of the said frigatea of forty-four,
and one of thirty-six guns.
That a discretionary power be committed to the President of the
United States to cause the others to be finished, having a due regard
to the existing price of labor and materials.
That so much of the sum of six hundred and eighty-eight thousand
eight hundred and eighty-eight dollars and thirty-two cents, as, by
the act of June, 1794, was appropriated to pay the expenses to be
incurred by the act to provide a naval armement, remammg unexpended, as well as so much of the sum of e g h t t h o u m d dollars,

ALGIERS18'8 March 1796
SIB. * * * The Regency of Algiers, which contains from two to three
Millions of Inhabitants, is Governed, & has been for neare three centuries, by
about 12,000 Turks, this number has never exceeded fifteen Thousand, & is
generally above ten. Theee Turks are natives of some part of the Levant, and
are inlisted and brought here as Soldiers. They are generally ignorant & ferot~ous
adventurers, & many of them have been guilty of crimes for which they flee
their Country. It is a common saying in the Levant that no honest man goes
to Algiers. They all do duty and receive pay as Soldiers, their pay is very small
a t first, but it rises in proportion to the time they have been in service, & they
are all elegible to any Office in the Government, They rarely Marry. The laws
of the Regency discourage in several ways the Matrimony of the Turks. A
Married Turk receives nothing but his pay, He that is not married, in addition
to his pay, is lodged in the Barracks & fed - Besides, if he Marrys a Moorish
Woman or a Native of the Country, his Children are not Turks, and consequently
can hold no Office civil or Milatary, He cannot in general Marry a Turkish Woman,
for when he leaves his country he is too poor to bring a Wife with him, and a
Turkish single Woman rarely comes to Algiers to get a Husband. The Moors
have no arms of any kind and they are not suffer'd to learn the use of them.
It is a high crime for a Merchant to sell any Arm or Amunition to a Moor,
and the excessive rigor of this Milatary Government has accustomed them to
consider the Turks as a superior race of beings, not only as endowed with greater
force arising from the use of Arms, but as the favourites of the prophet & the
Lords of the Country. These are some, but not all the reasons, why a Country
so extensive & fertile, so broken with Mountains & naturally defensible, and
peopled by a strong, well made, active race of men, has been govern'd for so many
ages by a Handful1 of strangers. I mention these circumstances to show that
the Algerine Turks are not Patriots, 8: that they cannot be so from the Constitution of the corps. For it is not to be expected that a Man can have any Affection
for a Country where neither he nor his friends can have any Posterity, or if they
leave any, they must be sunk among the Miserable Vassals of the Country, w.ho
are despised & plunderd by thire proud rulers: & i t is difficult to conceive with
what contempt & injustice the Moors are treated by the Turks. This body then
being held togather by no other tie than that of self preservation, the proper
object of each individual is to enrich himself by Plunder, the poor Soldiers by
marauding among the Country People, & the Men in Office by commiting Piracies
upon all Nations who do not purchase their peace by paying large sums of Money
to every Officer in the State for their Private use, and Annual tributes, which go
into the Public Treasury. The Government was formdy an Aristocracy, a t
least in theory. The Dey was supposed to be chosen b the whole jbody of the
Turks, & every Soldier had an equal Vote. He was chief Gagistrate and President
of the Divan, which was a Council composed of 42 of the most ancient Officers in
the Army & frequently assembled to deliberate upon Peace & War & other great
matters of state. But the Government has now become a Sim le Monarchy.
The Divan has not been assembled for some Years, & the %ey is subject ta
no other check than what arises from the Necessity he is under of distributing
foreign presents, & sometimes his own Money, among the principal Officers, to
secure himself from Assasination and to prevent Mutinies. * * * It is necessary to observe that, as the peace-presents which every nation makes, & generally
to a great amount, go principally into the hands of the Dey and other great
Officers, and as the annual tributes only are destined wholy to the public treasury, it is the intrest of these men to break friendship with every nation ss often
aa possible. They are sure to be enriched by every Treaty, let the object of it
be what it may. They use no other precaution in this kind Of. Policy than that
of Allowing a Nation to enjoy a Peace long enough to feel the advantage of a
free Navigation in these seas, so far as to be willing to come forward again with
their peace Offering when the rupture happens, These breaches of peace are often
made upon the most frivolus & unjuat pretences that can &.imagined, & generally speaking, every Nation has ~ t sturn, The only except~onsare France &
England, whose great Naval strength Over Awes them in such a manner that
their peace has been less interrupted. But even these powem, though they
pretend not to pay tribute, expend a great deal of Money in Ooaaional presents.
If peace with America should now take place, i t will not probably last without

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS
Interuption Seven Years. They are now oing to War with Denmark, After
that it is probable they will take Venice or kweeden, or both, they will then try
Holland again & perhaps Spain, and our turn will be the next.
But the difficulties in treating with this regency a t present arise not only from
the Constitutind character of the Government, but likewise in a greet messure
from the personal character of the Dey, who is a Man Of a most ungovernable
temper, passionate, changeable & Unjust, to such a degree that there is no calculating his policy from one moment to another. During the reign of the last
Dey, who died in 1791 this man held some of the first O5cea in the State, and
had made himself vastly rich, particularly by the Spanish ace, which was the
richest treaty they had ever made. The Government of g a i n did not choose
to make known the erpence of this Treaty, but I am told that it coat, to make
i t and Maintain i t to this time, about 5 Millions of Dollars, of which this man
received about One Million a t the time of making it, besides a great proportion
of the presents since; especially since he has been Dey, His influence was so great
before he arrived a t his dignity that nothing could be done without him. This
peace which was the first that the Spaniards ever had with this Regency, was
concluded in 1786 - By a proper distribution of money among the chiefs of the
Turks, this Man procured his Nomination, or rather proclamation to the Deylick,
the Moment his predicessor expired. He then caused to be arrested and Banished
or put to death, the principal Officers of State, who had served under the old
Dey. He created a new set of Favourites, men who are mere cyphers in his
councill, not one of whom dares to offer an opinion contrary to his own. He
has not only Violated the Constitution by not suffering the Divan to assemble
dureing his reign, but his conduct in other respects has a strong tendency to
Vilify the Turks in the eyes of the natives of the Country. His principal favourites a t present are Jews. He likewise favours the Moorish Merchants, and
treats the Turks with unusual severity. This sort of policy, if continued for a
Number of Years cannot fail to break the charm on which the Turkish Authority
is founded in this country, and over set the Government altogather. But we
can hardly look for such an event, as this man is old and cannot last long. Besides we know the Turks are no strangers to the manner of getting rid of a master
when his t rany becomes insupportable, He is now going to War with the Danes

with Algiers, I wiil finish this long letter by some reflections on the means of preserving it, I will begin by observing that our peace a t present will place us on a
footing very different in many respects from what it might have been, had we concluded it a t the time when Mr Lamb was sent here, or even at any time before the
captureg in 1793 We were then considered as a Nation of very little consequence

in a tributary view in this place. It was thought that we could not afford to pay
much, and that our Commerce would be so little in these seas that there would be
little chance of makeing American Fkizeu, so that a trifle would have aatisfyed
them a t first. And as very few American Veaaela would have had ocaaion to visit
the ports on this part of the Barbary coast, the same opinion might have been
continued for many years. I n that case it would have been best not t o have
entertained a Consul here, but to have put our rrffairs under the protection of
France, to whoae Consul we might have payd One or two Thousand D o h 8 s
Year which I belive would have coverd all expences of maintaining a peace for
some time. * * * It ia well known that the Algerine policy is extremely
capriooua. Tbere is one point only in which it is fixed, which is that the regency
must be a t War somewhere, and their little perpetual hoetilities with Malts,
Genoa, & such Btstes aa are consts;ntly on their guard, will not satidy them.
They must break out now and then with a Nstion accustomed to peace coneequently 05their guard. when one of those Nations makes or renews s peace it
increases the danger for the rest, for a new blow must be struck somewhere, & it
is the duty of a Consul to be perpetually on the watch, * * *

To David Hnmphreys, U. 8. Minister to Lisbon, Portugal, and in charge of negotiations with Barbary Powers, from Joel Barlow, U. 8. Agent, Algiers

M YDEAR SIR * * * there is no doubt in my mind 6ut that the
Treaty will be ratified. I do not know how much information on
Barbary affairs there may be lodged in the office of the Secreta of
State, or in the minds of those who have to decide this question. ?but
I think they cannot fail to have knowledge enough on the subject to
enable them to draw the following conclusions: - That if this treaty
is rejected there will still be 100 captives to redeem, which must be
done, if done a t all, at a much higher price, probably not less than
3000 dollars a head: - that the war breaking out anew at fr moment
when (under the idea that peace is concluded) many amencan ships
will be in these seas, probably 100 more of our citizens will fall into
their hands, to be redeemed at a like price, besides the loss of ships &
cargoes: - that the Portuguese will soon be a t peace if we are n?t,
& leave these pirates masters of the western ocean: - that attemptug
to protect our navigation by our frigates, even if they were ready,
would cost in one year near half a much as, the proposed peace, ant
that those three items put together would amount to a sum that would
pay for the peace, & maintain it, in all probability, for six years: - that
as it would be extremely inconvenient on every account to be at war
with a people of their character & so distant, we should h d it necessary
to sue again for a peace as soon as possible, and then the terms wdl be
augmented a t least 100 percent, besides the sacrifices above mentioned. For, as the English & Spaniards are known to be hostlle to our
interasta in this quarter, & the both enjoy great infiuence here,as the French, however friend y & well cbsposed towards us, are
unable to yield us any assistance till they have established their own
&airs a t home & reestablished them here, - and as the Dey will be
highly exasperated a t the failure of the negotiations, which he will
ascribe to bad faith & treachery on our part, i t will be vastly ~UEcdt,
if not impracticable, to renew them again during his reign.

every thing that they & we can do wilt save the treaty, i t will be
saved, but I can scarcely say I have any hope.

SIRThe Dey has this moment given us to understand that he has
come to the following decision relative to our affair: - that in 8 days
we shall be sent away from this place, that h0 will then allow thirty
days & no more, before hi9 cruisers shall have orders to bring in
American ships, that if within that time the money should come to
pap the sums stipulated by M' Donddson, he will recieve it, & conclude the peace, otherwise it is war; and as he shall oonsider the treaty
as violated on our part he will be under no obligations to renew it.
The port is now shut, and has been for three weeks, so that we hire a
courier express to go to Tangier with a letter for our consul a t Gibraltar, desiring him to give notice as far as possible to the Americam,
& to forward this letter to you.
It is needless for us to add, for the purpose of convincing vou, that
we have done every thing in our power to ward off this fatal stroke
that has been long impending over t,his affair, and that now seems
inevitable. Indeed very little has been in our power to do, considering the ignorance in which we have been kept relative to the state of
the funds, & to your intentions as to fulfilling the conditions of the
treaty.
When we go from hence we shall endeavour, a t least one of us, to
get to Alicante. As we know not what may be in your power to do
yet to save the business, it may be useful to give you that opportunity
to address a letter to us under cover to our consul, which perhaps
you had better address to either of us.

SIBAfter finishing our dispatches on the 3e inst. to send by a

counier to Tangier we found that the port was to be opened b e diably. We therefore gave up that mode of conveyance for a more
direct & speedy one by way of Alicante. We have now what we hope
will be more agreeable news to announce to you. For two days past
we have been witnesses to a scene of as complete and poignant distress
as can be immagined, arising from the state of total despair in which
our captives found themselves involved, and we without the power of
admimstering the least comfort or hope. The threat which we men-

144

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM lY86 TO 1801

tioned in our last of sending us away had been reiterated with every

mark of a fixed & final decision. And the Dey went so far m to
declare that after the thirty days, if the money did not come, he

never would be a t peace with the Americans. Baccry the Jew, who
has as much art in this sort of management as any man we ever knew,
who has more influence w i t h the Dey than all the regency put
together, and who alone has been able to soothe his impatience on
t b subject for three months past, now seemed unable to make the
least impression. And the Dey finally forbade him, under pain of
his highest displeasure, to speak to him any more about the Americans.
His cruisers are now out, and for some days past he has been occupied
with his ncw war against the Danes. Three days ago the Danish
prizes began to come in, and i t was thought that this circumstance
might put him in good humour, so that the Jew might find a chance
to renew our subject in some shape or other. We instructed the Jew,
that if he could engage him in conversation on his cruisers & prizes he
might offer him a new American built ship of 20 guns, which should
sail very fast, to be presented to his daughter, on condition that he
would wait six months longer for our money. The Jew observed
that we had better say a, ship of 24 guns, to which we agreed. After
seeing him three or for times yesterday under pretences of other
business, without being able to touch upon this, he went this morning
and succeeded. The novelty of the proposition gained the Dey's
attention for a moment, & he consented to see us on the subject.
But he told the Jew to tell us it must be a ship of 36 guns [Gescent],
or he would not listen to the proposition. We were convinced that
we ought not to besrtate a moment. We accordingly went and consented to his demand, & he has agreed to let every thing remain as it
is for the term of three months from this day, but desired us to remembe dlowed on any account.
ber that not a single day beyond that \dl
We consider the business now as settled on this footing. And it is
the best ground we codd possibly place it upon. You still have it in
your power to say peace or no peace. You have an alternative, in
the other case you bad none, but war was inevitable, and there could
have been no hope of peace during the rei of this Dey.
The guns are to be eight poundcrs (engEh nines) 24 on the main
deck, 8 on the quarter & four on the forecastle. the 12 last may be
smaller. She ought to be built long in proportion & formed for
sailing fast, a circumstance particularly pleasing here. We think such
a vessel fitted for sea may be delivered in America for 45,000 dollars,
Then, as by the terms of the treaty we have to deliver a quantity of
long spars & other timber, this vessel d be n proper one to transport
a cargo of them to this place. And in this view a saving may be made
of about 10,000 dollars in freight.
In order to save the treaty thus far, which has been a subject of
infiniteanxiety and vexation, we found it necessary some time ago to
make an offer to the Jew of 10,000 sequmes (18,000 dollars) to be paid
eventually ifhe succeeded, & to be distributed by him at his discression
among such great oBcers of State as he thought necessary, and to keep
as much for himself as he could keep consistent with success. The
whole of this new arrangement will cost the U. S. about 53,000 dollars.
We expect to incur blame, because it is impossible to give you a comlete view of the circurnstsnces, but we are perfectly confident of
wted right.

With regard to the transfer of the funds to this place we believe i t
can be done with the least dBculty thro' Leghorn, that is to draw
from that place on London, Madrid or Lisbon, as shall be most advantageous, perhaps on d. Unless you can ship a part in specie from

The Articles charged in livres are taken from those I brought from
Paris. Those charged in Sequins were purchased in Algiers I t will be noticed that this present has cost about 11,000 Dollars
more than an ordinary tribute of the kind. To show the reason of
this it is necessary to accompany these details with a few words of
explanation. Such cloth as is bought in England for about 18 Shilhgs
a yard is bought here for 3 Sequins a pique, which is about 25 s
for 25 inches, or 36 shillings a yard. Consuls established here usua y
order their cloths from England or France, in which case (allowing for
all charges) a saving is made of at least 40 per cent. The same may
be observed of the other articles that compose this tribute. Watches
and Jewelry are generally ordered from Geneva, from persons accustomed to furnish for Barbary, - Brocades & damasks from Lyons,
Linnen from Holland, kc.
I have mentioned in another place that no saving was made in the
articles I brought from Paris, even those that have been employed.
They were ill chosen for the purpose. I t was necessary to give a
richer object to produce the same effect as might have been produced
by the value of that object laid out with the Jews of Algiers.
But these observations are not sufficient to account for the extraordinary expence of the present. I t was an extraordinary occasion. It
was the first after a new peace, and on that account was expected to
be very rich. Besides, the Dey was extremely irritated a t the delay
of the funds, and while I was preparing the Articles he sent me word
that unless it was nearly double the value of an ordinary consular
present it should not be recieved.
Since the present war in Europe, which has deranged every thing,
an ordinary consular present has cost from 16 to 17 thousand dollars.

In times of peace, with good economy, i t may be made for 13 or 14

in the proportion of near one half since the Spanish peace.

ALGIERS
17 A p d 1796
SIR I take the liberty of inclosing herewith the copies of my dispatches forwarded a few days ago to the care of M hlonroe. Nothing
material has happened in our affair since the date of my last, except
that I have been forced to yield to the im atience of the Dey so far
as to make the consular present. I was ed to this necessity from
what past when I f i s t arrived. I thought it highly expedient a t that
time to have something new to offer which might prove a farther
guarantee of our sincerity in the business of the peace, at the same
time avoiding if possible any additional expence to the United States.
I therefore sent him word that I was ready to make the consular
resent although I was not consul, and it should be considered as
!eing made for the consul that should be named, as there had not yet
been time for any nomination to arrive from America. I knew that
an anticipation in this article would not affect the returning period of
this biennial tribute, for it must always be dated from the date of the
treaty. He was then in too great a rage to listen to any thing, and
continued so till the 5" of April, as I have stated in my former letter.
Dwing this interval I recieved from Mr Humphreys a new Commission as a sort of temporary consular agent. I n my great anxiety
lest the affair should be lost I was glad to seize hold of any thing
which might give us a chance of placing i t on more solid ground, and
I sent him word that I was now Consul, and asked whether he would
recieve the present. This he refused, and returned a menacing and
insulting answer; and as the messenger was stooping to kiss his hand
he struck him in the face. The messenger at the same time delivered
him a letter from M' Humphreys in answer to one he had mitten to
Lisbon. He took i t in his hand & threw it out the door with great,
fury, uttering many execrations and threats. It wns picked up &
brought back to us, where it still remains unopened.
Thus the matter rested as to the consular present, and as I was told
he had a bad memory I was in hopes he had forgot what had been said
on thst subject. But soon after M' Donaldson's departure he sent
fnendly message, though in some points rather humiliating.
He asaid e had never treated any nahion with so much lenity and forme
bearance as he had the Americans, and he meant always to do so as
long as they should deserve it by their good conduct. He believed
them a good people, though they had many enemies, but he would be
their friend, and he waa now ready to recieve the consular present. He
thought it best to make it now, although the peace was not concluded,
as it would tend to stop the mouths of a great many officers among
whom it was to be distributed, and who were constantly teasing him
to put an end to this business one way or the other. This last assertion
I am confident is not true. Those o&cers who have any iduence
with him I. believe have used it in our favor.

P

veT

147

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS

I n this situation I could not refuse the present, and I thought it
imprudent, considering the extreme irritability of his mind, to attempt
a farther explanation with respect to the consul that might arrive;
especially as I considered that it might be easily arran ed so as to
avoid the risk of being obliged to renew the present be ore the end
of the two years.
Among the few ideas that are familiar to his mind (and it is impossible to force a new one into it) are those of Consul, vice Consul &
Secretnrg. Without disturbing the mechanism of his brain he can
concieve that the consul may be absent for aDy length of time, and the
business be carried on by his deputy or secretary. And he pays the
same respect to them as to the principal. This is often done. The
Dutch Consul has now been absent near a year, under the idea that he
is to return, and his secretary does the business. Therefore, to save
expence, there will be no inconvenience in his considering me as
consul, though absent, during the remainder of this term. When I
go from hence I can take leave as though I were to return, telling him
that I expect a vice consul here as soon as he can be appointed and
arrive, and pray him to recieve him as myself till my return. Our
country being so distant will be a motive for his agreeing to a long
absence. He cannot expect me to settle my affairs in America &
return here for a fured residence under a year. And before he would
grow uneasy the term of two years from the date of the treaty will
expire. I t has now but little more than sixteen months to nm.
For this purpose it will be necessary that the person arriving as
consul should announce himself as m deputy or secretary, and assume
no other character till near the c ose of the above term. If the
President and the person appointed should consent to this arrange
ment there will be no need that I should have any appointment or
commission. Indeed, so far as respects the Dey, commission &
exequatur I believe are out of the question. I thmk he never asks
for or delivers any papers in such cases. Common report that a man
is one thing or the other is enough for him. A consul's commission
here is his seal, and his exequatur is a Turk that the Dey gives him,
under the name of Drogoman, who attends bim on all occasions as hiS
protector, friend, m terpreter & messenger.
I t is perhaps needless to add that an arrangement like this cannot
n.ffect the interest of the person appointed or of the United States, as
it cannot be supposed that I have any idea of recieving any part of
the emoluments of the place, whatever they may be. I am sorry the
affair has got into this train, but it was really out of my power a t any
one time to prevent it, without neglecting what I thought to be my
duty in tying to rescue the whole from ruin.
To avoid any difficulty in case a commission should be asked for
(which is not commonly done) it would be well that the person appointed should have a commission as secretary or vice consul, to show
in case of need. If he should have been appointed and set out before
this letter reaches you, & if he comes b way of Lisbon, he may
recieve such a commission from Mr Hump eys, to whom I will send
a copy of this letter.
Thrteen Danish vessels are already sent in by the cruisers. I
ought to have mentioned to you before, to show the temper of this
government, that before the cruisers went out, the consul offered to
deliver here the 320 Turkr, without delay, the identical ones that were
taken, as far as they could be had, and others to make up the deficiency,

and to deposit ninety thousand dollars in the Treasury as a security

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS

There is another way in which by a fair estimation we might balance
the above account of expence for a peace with Barbary. The Algerine
cruisers will. sometimes go out of the Straits, tho' they are not at
peace with Portugal, And American ships will sometimes venture in
though we are not at peace here. One ship a year taken by them would
amount to a sum equal to maintaining a peace. And they have taken
in this way enough to average one ship a year since the American war.
Suppose the ship to have ten persons on board to be redeemed,

Another way in which I presume the account is balanced every year
that we are at war with Algiers is the advanced price of insurance
that the American Commerce pays. Besides, this brings foreign bottoms into competition with ours in our own commerce, and has an
effect to stint the growth of our navigation even in the Atlantic.
But an event to be anticipated with certainty, is that the Portuguese
will soon be at peace here if we are not. And then we may almost
take leave of the Atlantic. These cruisers will go to the Bay of
Biscay & to the English Channel, and the price of insurance on our
navigation will be so inhanced for all that part of Europe, that the
Americans must sell their ships. I believe the English government, if
we were a t war here, would pay for the Portuguese peace rather than
it should not be had. And I am not certain but that they could
afford to do it. The effect it would have to lessen our navigation and
increase their own would be such as to indemnify them in a few years.
I suppose this peace might be had for a million & a half of dollars,
and I suppose that the higher price of freight and additional number
that would come into their bottoms on this account would make a
profit to them of half a million a year. Perhaps the fear that the
French should participate in these advantages may prevent the
English from doing it, but nothing will prevent the Portuguese.

Louis XIV said if there was no Algiers he would build one; as it
would be the cheapest way of depriving the Italian States of their
natural right of navigating their own seas; a policy doubtless unworthy
of us, and only fit for a king. But as long as the Powers of Europe
will persist in this policy,.whether we will or not, we must either be
its victims or partake of ~ t advantages.
s
There is no doubt but we
ought to prefer the latter, -to maintain our peace as cheap as we can,
but by all means to be a t peace, - and be ready to renounce our portion of this unnaturaI exclusive privilege the moment the right can

presenting a frigate of 36 Guns to the Dey of Algiers. an oppollvnity of forwarding a Duplicate, I would not

offerin one additional remark, on the expediency, ,policy & necessity
of our astening the equipment of a naval force, arising from the actual
state of our &aira in the Empire of Morocco. - The remark is,
that, in m o inion, we ought always to have a small navd force in
readiness or a, to prevent the evils which might otherwise result
from an sudden Revolution, and particularly of naval circumstances,
in the B?mpire of Morocco - even if we were to pay no regard to the
other Barbary States.
That Emplre continues still divided, & it is impossible to decide in
what manner that division may result, & +ether each of the contending Parties may not ultimately remam m possession of some of
the Sea-Ports. In which case, both parties may have their Cruizers
a t Sea. Muley Solirnon at present retains the Provinces of the
North, & all the Harbours capable of containing armed vessels.
Muley Ishem possesses the Territory in the South, with some Ports
which receive merchant vessels; & a t which, a t present, a most
flourishing & lucrative trade is carried on. - Muley Soliman, is
reported, to be preparing another expedition against the City of
Morocco. But it is very doubtful whether he will succeed. - as
Muley Ishem (that of a feeble & unenterprising Character) being
strengthened by the Provinces under Ben Assar & other powerful
Bashaws, is tbought to have a land force much superior to that of
Muley Solirnan. On the other hand, the Generals attached to the
Party of Muley Ishem, are reported, to be meditating on Attack upon
Magador. Should this succeed, Cruizers will doubtless be fitted out
from thence to the annoyance of our vessels bound to Ports in allegiance to Muley Solirnon. - As his Cruizers now make Prizes of all
vessels they meet, destined to or from S d , or other Ports in possession of his Brother, Muley Ishem. Portuguese, Danish & Swedish
vessels have been thus captured. But fortunately for us, none
belonging to the United States - notwithstanding reports that some
hsd been captured a few days ago, and notwithstandmg our Citizens
owed by the prospect of uncommon ain) will persist in going to
+f6, in despite of every thing that c m e said or done to deter them
from it.
An Ambassador from Muley Ishem, lately arrived here in an American vessel from S a 5 - His object was to obtain from this Court the
protection of their fleet a t Gibraltar for vessels bound to the Territory
of Muley Ishem, to bring wheat from thence to Portugal. At t b s
moment, this Trade is an object of vast magnitude to the several
European Nations, which have not a supply of wheat in their own
Countries. The quantity of wheat exported (principally from that
part of Morocco which IS in the power of Muley Ishern) to Spain,
Portugal & England, within a year past, is incredible. But for this
resource, Portugal (in which wheat is now plentier & cheaper, than in
perhaps any other Country of Europe) would have experienced a
frunine - as it has been deprived, in a great measure, of its former
supplies from the upper part of the Mediterranean, from America &
from the North of Europe. The beforementioned Ambassador haa
proceeded from hence to Madrid, to solicit the naval protection of that
Government slso for that Trade.
I mention these circumstances to shew, by some sudden reverse of
affairs in Morocco, how much we may be exposed to have all our

To Secretary of State from Joel Barlow, U. S. Agent,* Algiers

ALGIERS4 May 1796
NQ6
SIR The Dey, who is the most restless and impatient man in the
world, has ordered M Cathcart to go to Philadelphia, to give such
information as may be useful to our Government in expediting the
collection & transportation of those articles wbicb were promised as a
art of the pence present. Mr Cathcart is one of our captives, and
pas been employed 8 s head Christian clerk to the regency. I told him
I could not think of subjecting the United States to any part of the
e ence of this journey; and he, to obtain his liberty sooner than he
ot erwise would, undertakes it at his own expence. I believe however
that the experience he has bad in this place will enable him to render
you great service, from the variety of details he mill be able to give
you in a business so new; as likewise (if you should think proper to
employ him) in collecting & transporting the articles required.

The Dey has often expressed a desire that the American Government woxdd be particularly punctual in bringing fonvard this tribute,
and in fulfilling dl its engagements here. And so far as the reason
he gives for it is founded in truth I give him credit for his sensibility
on the subject. He says that, as the peace was made in opposition
to so many enemies, and (in regard to its terms) against the opinion
of his officers, be considers it, as a favorite child of his own, and as such
he means to cherish it as long as he lives. But to assist him in supporting i t against the attacks that may await i t hereafter frqm those
quarters, he shall have need of this argument, that the Amencans are
more punctual and honest than other nations. His proposing to send
a person to America on this errand is a sort of proof of his sincerity.
But whether the reason he gives is altogether founded in truth or not,
I am confident the desire he ex-presses is perfectly conformable to our
policy. You will find it verg difficult to maintain peace here a t any
rate; but without a prompt and scrupulous compliance with engsgements, it is impossible. * * *
The Dey has handed me a note of the articles he expects for the
annual tribute. And as his expectations are law in this case, 1
enclose it to you with such remarks as occurred to me a t the time.
To hurry this part of our business is one of bis objects in Mr Cathcart's mission. Indeed it is time that this operation was begun, as
the first year will be nearly elapsed by the time he will arrive. I am
sorry it is not in my power to give you a just idea of the value that

23 June 1796
I t is very disagreeable to me to be under the necessity of acquainting you with my unhappy situation. I sailed from Cette in the
Schooner Eliza, Ca t. Sam! Graves, belonging to me. Two days
after leaving that p ace, which was the 14th Instant, I was captured
by a Tunissian Row Galley and brought into this place. By the
advice of M' Famin I have presumed to write you craving your
assistance. Unfortunately I was taken one day previous to the
negotiation you had authorised him to make in behalf of the United
States. The Bey considers my vessel as a prize & all the people as
slaves. But by the interference of Mr Famin we are all exempted
from any laborious work, untill advice is recg from you.
I need not pretend to describe to you my situation, as I think you
can form an idea of it by what the prisoners have suffered in Al 'em.
Mf Famin this day informed me that the Bey has agreed to r ease
my vessel & liberate the people, provided the govern5 d l consent to
pay an additional sum of Ten thousand dollars, and will w&t untill
an answer is r e d from you. M' Famin has written to you by express,
by which conveyance you will recieve this. Knowing you have full
ower vested in you to make a treaty with the Bey of Tunis, I can't
gut think you d feel for me in my present situation, and use your
utmost endeavours to alleviate my sufTerings. And it is but a small
sum for the government to ay for the redemption of so many men
were on board the vessef I have now lost all I assessed, and
mthout your consent to this sum being paid we sha undergo the
greatest hardships.
I sailed from Gibraltar last January. I was there informed that
peace was made with all the Mahometan powers. I arrived at
Barcelona and disposed of my cargo. I took my cash and proceeded
for Cette. A violent gale of wind obliged me to put into Agde where
I was detained a few days. A number of men entered m vessel

Truce with Tunis, for six months, concluded by Joseph Etienne Famin, for Joel

[Translation]

The motive of the writing of this document is as follows: On the 11th
of the month of Zu'lhijjah of this year 1210, answering to the 15th of
June [June 17, 1796, according to the chronological tables] according to the Greek calendar. The glory of the princes of the Christian
nation, the selected chief among the community of Jesus, Washington,
the present ruler of America-may his days end with blessingsbeing desirous and ~ 4 s h i i gto negociate a treaty of peace in order
to lay the foundations of friendship and to strengthen the sincere
amity with the frontier post of the Holy War, the victorious garrison
of Tunis the well-preserved, just as our friends the other christian
governments have done the same with our victorious garrison, has
confided the negociations of the said treaty to his consul Barlow,
residing in Algiers, and the said consul again has confided the negociations of the treaty to the French merchant Joseph Famin, residing
in Tunis the well-preserved. The said merchant has appeared in
my presence and has stated and declared in general his wish and desire
for a treaty between the American ruler and the Government of Tunis
the well-preserved. After it has been immediately communicated
and confirmed to the said merchant on what terms a treaty could be
agreed to, the said merchant has communicated the stipulations of
the treaty to the said consul, and the said consul has commun~cated
it to his government. Now until the answer comes and within a
limit of six months after the date of this document, security has been
given. Therefore if during the said period war vessels of our well
preserved garrison place meet at sea m t h ships of the said Americans
they shall not hinder them or molest them in any way, but they shall
be treated as friends, and immediately order has been given to our
officers to let them go their way. If American ships meet with ships
belonging to our well-preserved garrison place, i t has been agreed
between the two Governments, that they shall treat each other in a
friendly way. This convention has been written and sealed and given
into the hands of the said merchant, so that he may send it to its
proper place. Until the arrival of the answer this convention shall
be observed between the two governments; according to it both
parties shall act and it shall be oppowd in no way.

wanted for the Brig's crew: the su lus will serve towards a supply
to our captive citizens, if fortunate y their redemption be effected.
The Brig? is deemed incompetent to bring the whole number to America: but she may perhaps suffice to cross the Mediterranean, to some
port or ports in Spain where they may find American vessels in which
they may take their passages home; and,the Brig? may bring the
remainder.

The golden coffee pot and salver are omitted for no such things exist

for not furnishing them; and the rich and highly gilt china pots and

D' SIR,In answer to your enquiries relative to the dimensions of the
frigate for the Mediterranean Service, I have to inform you, that she
is to carry 36 guns, of which 24 are to be nine pounders, and the other
twelve six pounders. On these grounds I desired Mr Humphreys to
calculate the proper dimensions of the hulk, and to make a draught
of the same. The draught I presume M: Pox has completed, in whch
the dimensions must be accurately stated. Independently of which
however, M' Humphreys made the inclosed statement: but if it varies
from the draught (for i t was written you will see on the 2gth of June,
when the draught was only begun) the latter must be the guide. Her
masts, spars, sails and cordage may be calculated after Mr Fox's
return, as well as the anchors and all her other equipments. The

guns, powder & shot you will perceive by the inclosed letter & estima,te
of Mr Hodgdon, are on hand. The guns, however, ought to be
critically examined, and proved: they ought also, I thnk, to be uniform; and if those we have are not so, it may be best to cast a new set
at Cecil furnace, and to have them turned (to take off the most considerable roughnesses at least) while they are boring.

Dear SIR Notwithstanding I have had no letter from you since the
34' of May; and the time for our payment is expired, I have been able

162

NAVAI; OPERATIONS FROM 1785 TO 1801

not only to keep the peace, but to liberate our people. I have done
this by drawing bills on you for the amount of the ,redemption, of
which I give you the particulars in my letter of advlce of this day.
I draw at 34 mazoons for the Dollar of Leghorn, which is considered
as the par of exchange.
Lest you should have shipped the money for this place before the
arrival of this, I take from the Jews a guarantee against damages.
That is, if the biis are not accepted & paid in Leghorn, and if the
money ia here to pay them on their return, they are to be returned &
dischar ed here without Damages. But you will observe that this
cannot \e done unless the whole of the money is here for the price of
the peace as well as redemption.
I have arranged the buslness in this way for the following reasons.
1" i t is the only way in which I can get the people free & save the rest
of them from dying with the lague. 2d!y M Humphreys has informed me that you have a ere ' t lodged in Leghorn for 400,000 dol:
& in Lisbon for 200,000 more for which you can draw. And these
sums I believe are more than the whole amount. 3di7 the opportunity of drawing at par is a great advantage, as i t saves the risk of
transportation, &c. The people o to Leghorn in a ship of Baccr-y's. I t is the only way
in which I ca d get them from this place. There are 49 Neapolitans
on board, to be landed at Leghorn. I have settled the freight for
ours w far as that place for 1500 Spanish dollars. The provisions
remaining after the Neapolitans are discharged belong to the United
States. At that place you & Mr Felichi our Consul will take such
measures for the transportation of oyr people to America as shall be
most convenient. You can retain t h ship by making a. new bargain
with Soloman Baccry of Leghorn, part owner, if you cannot do better.
If the Americans leave the ship a t Leghorn, Capt. Smith is to take
the command of her for the Baccrys for a farther destination. John
Foss is to be mate. I would thank you, in this case, to assist them in
making their asrangement with Soloman.
I rely on you & our consul & Soloman to agree with the govt of the
place with respect to the quaranteen. The ship has nothing but the
passengers & their baggage. I t is supposed that if we retain the ship
you can put the Neapolitans in the Lazeret & let ours proceed immedi, If they take their passage in another ship, there mill be no need
a? t eir being detained for a long quaranteen in that place.
of
I have advanced the people a month's pay extraordinary, that is for
August, as many of t-hemwere entirely dest~tuteof money, and almost
naked. I t will be farther necessary to give them some clothes at
Leghorn. their arrival on our coast Must be in cold weather. -

To Secretary of State from Joel Barlow, U. S. Agent, Algiers

ALGIER12 Jdy 1796
SIR I have the pleasure a t last to announce to you the hberation
of our people from Slavery in this place. To keep the eace after
the expqtion of the time limited for the payment, snffhdy to
redeem our citizens, without any money, has been a subject of more

164

difEculty & vexation than mill be imabgined by those who are unacquainted with the extremely capricious and savage character of the
Dey.

My being able to procure the liberation of the people at this time
has been owing to an accident. From some circumstances in the
commercial speculations in this place it has so happened that money
has been extremely scarce here for several months past. The Jew
house who serve as our Brokers, and who do the greater part of the
business of the place, hare had their funds for some time in the hands
of the French Government to the amount of half a million of dollars.
The operations of some other houses for a year past have centred
nearly in the same point. so that there was no money left except in
the public Treasury. Though I had so far gained the confidence of
the Jews that they declared t'o me that the would advance the money
to the amount of the Redemption if it courd be raised, yet I had little
faith in these professions, because I believed they said so under the
idea that the money could not be had in the town. The plague broke
out in the latter end of May, and very much increased my anxiety
for the fate of our people. Some time in June a new French Consul
arrived, and by some brilliant presents revived the influence of the
Republic with the Dey so far as to borrow from the public treasury
about 200,000 dollars, which he paid into this Jew House. I irnmediately insisted that they should prove the sincerity of their friendship
by lending me that sum and as much more as the redemption would
come to, for which I would give them my bills on Mr Donaldson at
Leghorn. The at first agreed to it, but afterwards raised difficulties
on account of t e risque of transportation at a time when the English
stop and examin all neutral ships. And as they wanted the money
here they said they must have the bills at about 3 per cent below the
usual exchange (that is, at 33 mazoons of Algiers for the piece of eight
rids of Leghorn. The usual exchange is 34: there being really no such
thing in this place as what we call a course of exchange.) I absolutely
refused to give the bills at a farthing below the usual exchange, as I
would not set such an example for American transactions here, though
I knew that the Dutch, the Danes & the Venitians had gone to 32 &
even to 31 in some of their late public payments with these same Jews.
It is finally settled at 34, and I take a guarantee against damages in
case the b i s come back under protest. I do this because I dont know
that Mc Donaldson has yet recieved the credit that MT Humphre s
informs me be has sent him; and if he has, he may have shipped t e
specie here before these bills will arrive.
This house has likewise become answerable to the Dey and Regency
for the remainder of the money we owe here as the price of the peace.
Without this the Dey would not agree to the Redemption.
I embark the people for Leghorn, because there is no vessel to be
had at this moment except one absolutely bound to that place; and I
cannot keep them here mthout the risque of losing many more of them
by the plague. Five have already died within a few weeks, and
another will probably die to day.
I beg leave to confirm what I mentioned in my letter b Mr Cathcart

with respect to the other advantages of hie mission.

ALGIERS
12 July lr96
SIR This will be presented to you by the remnant of our captive
citizens who have survived the pains and humiliation of slavery in
this place. After effecting their deliverance in the manner which I
state to you in my letter of this day, without funds or even any direct
intelligence that they afe soon to be expected, I have another task to
perform in which i t is unpossible to promise myself success; it is to
embark them without the infection of the plague.
Five of their fellow sufferers have died with that contagion within
a few weeks, and another who is attacked must be left behind. I t
rages with such violence in the town, that although they cannot embark without risk, yet it is much more dangerous for them to stay
longer here in any situation where it is possible for me to place them
in this most incommodious of all concievable abodes.
If they esca e infection we shall be much endebted to the attention
of Captain Ca der who commands the ship, and to the careful assistance of the other captains who inspect the embarkation, as well as to
the harmony & good understanding which prevail among all the crews.
When we reflect on the extravagant sums of money that this redemption will cost the United States, it affords at least some consolation to know that it is not expended on worthless 8: disorderly persons,
as is the case with some other nations who are driven, like us, to this
humiliation to the Barbary States. Our people have conducted themselves in general with a degree of patience and decorum which would
become a better condition than that of Slaves. And though after they
are landed in their country it would be useless to recommend them to
any additional favours from the government, yet I hope they will
recieve from merchants that encouragement in their professional industry which will enable them in some measure to repair their losses,
and from their fellow citizens in general that respect which is due to
the sufferings of honest men.
Several of them are probably rendred incapable of gaining their
living. One is in a state of total blindness; another is reduced nearly
to the same condition; two or three carry the marks of unmerciful
treatment, in ruptures produced b hard labour; and others have had
their constitutions injured by the p ague. Some of these are doubtless
objects of the charity of their countrymen; but whether this charity
should flow to them through the channel of the federal government,
is a question on which i t would be impertinent for me to offer an
opinion.

That no step yet, should have been taken to carry this measure into

~t ad been resolved to comply with the Deys request, and an actual
stipulation of our Agent, or Agents there; by what Department it is
to be carried into effect & is, on account of the delay which has been
occasioned (if contrary to the Ideas which have been communicated
to the Dey, & Col? Humphreys) extremely unpleast
Disagreeable as t h s requisition was found in its reception, and more
so in the compliance with it ;yet, as there appeared no other alternative
but to comply, or submit to the depredations of the Barbary Corsairs
on our Citizens, and Commerce, the former was preferred: & I had
no doubt (after pressing as often, and as earnestly as I did before I left
Philadelphia, that all Matters requiring my opinions, or Acts, might
be laid before me) that every thing relative to this Frigate was in a
perfect train of Execution, weeably to whatever assurances had been
given, by Captain OBrian. If the Laws establishing the different Departments (I have them
not by ma) does not expressly, or by analogy, designate the one to
which the care of such business is entrusted, I must, no doubt, assign
it; - but where these speak, it is best for me to be silent. If the building of this Vessel could have been suspended until the
meeting of Congress, for the Agency of the Senate, - the answer to the
Dey might have been suspended also. - But to avert, if possible,
the disagreeable consequences of delay, a prom t decision was come
to; and Captq OBrian hurried off with the resuft. - This decision,
and the letters which he carried, ought to be resorted to; and the
measures accorded thereto, strictly. - Whether it will be best to
purchase a ship ready built, if one fit for the purpose can be had
(and such an one on the Stock, at Philadelphia was talked of); Whether to contract for khe building & Equipping of one (some of the
Materials be' found) if entire confidence can be placed in the Undertaker; - or w ether to furnish the Materials (in which case all that
can be spared from our own Frigates ought, unquestionably, to be
applied) and pay for the building; depends upon enquiries not within
my power a t this time, and place to make; & must therefore, be a
matter of investigation, & consultation among yourselves; -especially
with the Secretary of the Treasury, on the Means.
Before I conclude, let me, in a friendly way, impress the following
Maxims upon the Executive Officers. - In all important matters, to
deliberate materialy, but to execute prom tly & vigorously, - and
not to put thin off until the morrow whicg can be done, and require
to be done, to a .- Without an adherence to these rules, busmess

I have likewise this day seen a letter from the Swedish Consul at
Tangier (a good Man, & much our friend) informing the Consul of the
same Nation in this Place of the captures before announced to you, of
one vessel with English & another with American Colours, by the
Cruizers of Muley Solirnan; and advising to dissuade all Swedish
vessels from taking freights to any port of Morocco. Six Portuguese
have, in all, been taken. All the Captains pretend that they are
bound to Magadore, & produce papers according1 - but the Commanders of Muley Soliman's Cruizers are not to e duped by them.
The English Captain, lately taken, presented false papers, but the
Moors beat him until he brought forth the true. This fact comes from
the English Consul at Tangier. The Moors now consider themselves
as having a right to mistrust all Ship-papers, believing many of them
to be false. On board of the American vessel (captured by them) was
intercepted a letter of advice purporting, that three other Americans
& one or two Swedes, were to sail for Saffi. Of course, all pessels
under those Colours which may be encountered, by Muley Sollman's
Cruizers, on or near that Coast, will be detained, searched & probably
carried into his ports, whether they may have the most authentic
papers, or not. Nor does the evil end here, Retaliation, or rather
similar Conduct towards neutral fowers has begun to take place on the
other part. A Corsair has been fitted out from SafE (one of the ports
of Muley Ishem) expressly to cruize against & capture all vessels
bound to ports in allegiance to Muley Soliman - One English vessel
has been carried into Saffi -but it is said to have been released, on the
fact being made apparent, that i t was not bound to any port in Africa.

quence of the civil war in that Country, & the inordinate desire of gain
in our own Countrymen, - & that what I foretold in my Nq 37, has
in part come to pass even sooner than I expected. There seems to be
no circumstance that indicates a speedy termination of the dispute for
Empire in Morocco. It remnins for the Government of the U. S. to
decide whether it will not be necessary to have some naval force-as
speedily as may be in readiness for Sea, unless we mean to relinqmsh
our Commerce to the South of Europe; or at least, to submit to have it
greatly harrassed & interrupted.
By the Courier of to-day we have only the confirmation of News of
the passing the Rhine by the Army under the Orders of Gen! Moreau.
Geni Jourdan had returned to the left bank of the Rhine. Gen!
Kleber was near the lines of Dusseldorf. Strong reinforcements were
marching from Holland & France to strengthen the Army at that
Place.

SIR I recieved but a few days ago your letter of the 24 June, that
of the 12 July came about the same time. Your capture is a most
disastrous circumstance to the Umted States as well as to you. I t
will make a difference of at least 30,000 - Dollars in the price of the
peace that I was concluding with that Regency.
I have consented to the Agreement made by Mr Famin for the
Redemption, including the Schooner & the Brandy on board. I
should not have included these, were it not for the sake of facilitating
the negotiation with the Bey and to favour your return & that of the
crew to America.
I have likewise in view the probability of her being useful at Leghorn
to carry home our citizens lately redeemed from Slavery at Algiers.
The Schooner, with the Brandy kc, is now the property of the United
States.
By my Instructions to Capt. Graves, which accompany this, you
will see the destination of the Schooner on her leaving Tunis. I have
therein consulted your convenience as fur as is consistent with the
interest of the United States. And I congratulate you on the speedy
& easy redemption you have experienced.
I beg you would sign your name with the Captain & the crew at
the bottom of the two copies of that paper of iqstructions. Indeed
I make it a condition of your and their Redemption that you all sign
that paper as it is to serve me as a voucher for the Transaction, as
well as to ensure the destination I have pointed out to the Schooner,
and the engagement of the men to do the service of the voyage.
I rely on your zeal $ intelligence in assisting Capt Graves with your
best advice on all occasions, whether the schooner shall convey our
other people from Leghorn to Philadelphia, whether she shall take a
freight from Leghorn or from Malaga, or return to America as she
is. * * *

to your Excellency, on the part of the said United States. I have
now that of dispatching Captq OBrien to Algiers, with such farther
proofs of the sincerity of the friendship & good will of the United
States towards your Excellency, as the circumstances would allow.
We feel a confidence that these repeated demonstrations of the faithfulness of the Government & Citizens of the United States to their
engagements will baffle ail the falsehood & malice of their enemies,
and, when the truth comes to be known, tend to produce a stronger
dection on the side of your Excellency, your Divan & Subjects in
favour of the said Government & Citizens, than if such falsehood &
malice had never existed.
Will your Excellency deign to receive such a respectful token of my
sensibility, of the honour conferred upon me by your having presented
a Sword & Sash to me, as it has been within the limits of my humble
abilities to procure? The only reason why this, token of gratitude
bas been delayed until this time, was, because i t 1s not permitted for
Citizens of the United States to accept Presents from foreign Princes,
without the permission of their own Government. - Having now obtsined that permission, I hasten to offer (by the hand of the American
Consul) that grateful Tribute of respect to your Excellency . . .
which will be accompanied also by a letter from the President of the

in the former, you will find the verification of the apprehension expressed in my NP 36 that the arrival of the French Troops at Leghorn
would interrupt the completion of our pecuniary operations a t that
place. I have received a letter from Mr Harry Fonnereau, dated a t

correct account in my power, of my proceedings since hm axrival
from America. After determthg to send on the Money from hence,
I lost no time in making enquiries at what premium an insurance
might be made on this property for the U. S. On learning it could
not be done much under Six pr Cent (& perhaps the whole amount
could not be covered a t that r ~ t by
e the Underwriters here) and on
taking inta consideration the favorableness of the season, the goodness
of the vessel, the ability of the Master, the protection of the Dey's
Passport, the President's Certificate of the vessel being in the Servlce
of Government, & other circumstances in favour of the security of
the voyage, I have been dissuaded from having an insurance made a t
so extravagant a price. I hope my arrangements hereupon (which
will now be before you) will meet the approbation of Government
. . As I have endeavoured to act for the best good of the
iublio interest, and could certainly have had no object in view but a
desire to perform the business in the best, cheapest & most expeditious
manner possible. In addition to the Provisions brought out in the
Sophia, Water Casks have been put on board a t this place. - I
forgot to mention that Capt? OBrien was delayed from sailing so soon
by one day, as he would otherwise have done, on account of a sad
accident which happened to his Chief Mate . . . who lost hie
hand by discharging an overloaded blunderbuss.
I have received several letters from our Consuls at difEerent ports,
relating instances of the usurpation of our flag by the Commf~ndersof
English Merchant vessels. I have advised them in former xnstances
to detain the false Papers dz send them to your Office. f have applauded their zeal and attempted to stimulate their vigilance. I have
even had occasion to complain to the Secretary of State for foreign
Affairs at this Court, against the conduct of the Governor of Madeira
for having improperly Interposed his authority on the subject; and I

as shall be named by the owner of the wprks. That this examination
shall commence by a verification of the diameters of the different parts
and ascertainment, whether there are more internal and external cavities or defects than are specified in the annexed Table, exhibiting the
defects which are to be tolerated. That in all cases where the bore or
caliber is found to be less than the diameter prescribed; and the defects not greater than those tolerated; the Cannon shall be returned to

cases where the defects are greater than those tolerated, the examination shall cease, and the Cannon be rejected.
5. That the instruments commonly employed to ascertain dimensions, and discover cavities or holes in the external and internal parts
of Guns shall be used on such occasions.
6. That the Touch-hole must end in the cannon, at the middle of
the rounding of the Angle at the bottom of the bore. That should any
holes be found in the Touch-hole, deeper than the twentieth of aninch,

shall be proved by two successive discharges. The weight of the
powder for the first discharge, shall be equal to two thirds of the
weight of the ball and for the second equal to half the weight of the
ball. The Cartridge shall be well rammed down with a wad over i t ;
two balls shall be placed over that with a wad of hay between them,
and a wad over, which shall be well rammed down; the balls to be
measured so as to allow a sdicient windage, and approved of by the
Officers who shall make the experiments, and the owner of the works,

must be placed on two pieces of wood having indentations large enough
to receive two thirds of the Trunnions, and with the hinder part a t a
sufficient distance from where the Trunnions lodge, so that the breech
may be inclined in any direction, but never so as to rest on the ground.

War O$ice September 27.1796.
SIR. I believe the best explanation relat~veto the proof by water,
will be, to give Mr Hughes a more detailed view of the mode in which
the experiment w i l l be directed to be made.
The object of the water proof is, to discover whether there are any
holes which penetrate through the sides of the Cannon: For this
purpose, the Examiners will be instructed, after the Cannon have
undergone the proof by powder, to place them upon-a thick piece of
Timber, so as they may be easily made to turn upon it. The Touchhole will be stopped with a wooden peg covered with tallow. The
Cannon will then be raised, and the chace surrounded with linnen,
so that any water which may fall down the sides, on filling the bore,
shall not be confounded with the drops that may a t e r through the
metal; and with the same view the water will be oured into the
e
aill bs
cavity by meam of the spout of a watering pot. ~ p water
then pressed upon by a rammer covered with thick cloth, so as to
fill exactly the muzzle of the Cannon. During this operation, the
exterior will be attentively watched to see whether any water passes
through the metal. If the least fiftration appears, the cannon will
be refused.
As to the dimensions of the twelve pounders &F the draughts are in
hand, and I expect w i l l be finished in a few days.

(N"0.)

LISBONOd! 6"P 1796.
This morning, Mr Clark, the Messenger announced in my last as

being expected from Alicante, put into my hand the Dispatches from
M? Barlow. Among them were two for you, which you will be
pleased to find enclosed. - Determined not to lose the earliest
occasion of transmitting them, I can only notice some of the most
interesting articles contained in those addressed to me. A m o q
which artr~cles,is Mr Barlow's correspondence with Mr Fa&. - m
consequence whereof a Truce for six months has been concluded with
Tunis (the Original & Translation [see 15 June 17961 are herewith
enclosed) and the Prisoners lately taken by a Tunisian Corsair in the
Schooner Eliza (previous to that Truce) redeemed. For it should
seem that the Bey had never heard of the Truce, which was pretended to have h e n made by his Agent (app~rmtlyat the instance
and under the sanction of the Dey) at Algiers. - This Schooner before
mentioned, Mr Barlow has put into the Service of the U. S. by having
sent her to Leghorn for the purpose of carrying our ransomed People
to America, if necessary. - The Instructions & Documents, relrttive
to this transaction, as well as to that of forwarding the said People
from Algiers, I hope to enclose to you by the next conveyance.
From Mr Barlow's not having heard anything of Captq O'Brien a t
the date of his last letter to me; and from the account he had received
of one American vessel of three Masts [ Betw of Boston] and another
of two, having been captured by a Corsair of Tripoli, I can not avoid
entertaining apprehens~onsthat the Brig Sophia may have been one of

176

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1786 TO 1801

them [*I: although I was induced fully to believe, by CaptW'Brien's
representation as well as from the nature of the circumstance, that
there could not possibly be any (not even the least) danger of such an
accident happening to s vessel, under the special Passport of the Dey,
covering property destined for himself & the Regency. The Dey's
Psssport was looked upon as being absolutely sacred w ~ t hall the Barbary Powers. I hope therefore my apprehensions may be groundless.
But I shall communicate them as soon as possible (before the return
of the Messenger) to Mr Barlow - and a t the same time, shall urge
him (if the fact should unfortunately prove so) to imprcss upon the
Dey the necessity of reclaiming his own property (I imagine he will
find no reluctance in doing it, or in resenting so gross an insult to
himself) and the impossibility of our attempting to send any Presents,
naval Stores &q destined for him, into the Mediterranean, unless we
can know with certainty that they will be protected by virtue of his
Passport, from every invasion or detention by any other of the
Barbary Powers.
I have just received letters from Mr Donaldson, the communication
of which must be postponed to another occasion.
P. S. From the good Character which M: Barlow has formerly received & given of Mr Joseph Famin; from the Zeal which he (Famin)
entered upon the business committed to him; from his apparent
intimacy with the chief Officer of the Bey, & his consequent influence
with the Bey himself, in obtaining a Truce without Present or promise
of gratuity; from the intelligence manifested in Famin's letter which
I propose transmitting to you in my next; and from the decided preponderance which the French Republic must have in the Councils of
all the Barbary Powers; I take the liberty to suggest, whether this
French Citizen might not be as proper a person as could be found for
Consul; in case a Consul should be appointed for Tunis - by limiting
Mr Donaldson's Consulate to Tripoli, as I heretofore intimated I
thought it would be indispensably necessary for us to have a Consul
in each of the four seperate Barbary States. [*One was the brig Sophia with $200,000 on board for Algiers in charge of
Richard O'Brien. After being detained in Tripoli Captain O'Brien arrived in

May i t please your Imperial Majesty to be informed, that, upon
my receiving the very fmt information that some vessels, under the
flag of the U. S. of America, had been a t SafE or other Ports of Morocco
not under your allegiance, I immediately wrote circular letters to the
Consuls of the U. S. in the neighbouring Countries & Islands to warn
all Captains of vessels belonging to the said U S. against such a
proceeding. That warning has likewise on several occasions since
that period been repeated in the most solemn & urgent manner. And
I have no doubt that the Government of the U. S. will, as soon as it
may be In their power, take effectual measures to,prevent their Citizens from prosecutmg a commerc~alintercourse n t h the said Places.
I therefore address this letter to your Imperial Majesty, for the purpose of entreating that the conduct of any Individuals who may
presume, in despite of the beforementioned warning, to offend
against your Royal regulations, should not be considered in any
d ee as affecting the Government or Citizens at large of the afored U. S. of America.
In full confidence that your well known justice will not permit the
innocent to be involved in the punishment which can only be due to
the guilty; and in offering the strongest assurances that the Government of the U. S. will do every thing in their power to maintain &
erpetuate inviolably the peace & friendship so beneficially estrtblshed with your Royal Father (of glorious memory) & so happily
confirmed by our Imperial Majesty; I pray Almighty God to have
your precious L e in his holy keeping, and to crown i t with length of

reasons for the agreement made by you and h'lr Donaldson on the 59
to furnish the Dey with a 36 gun frigate. The President, under the
circumstances of the case, did not hesltate to confirm our agreement.
The f ate [Crescani] is building a t Portsmouth, I&w Hampshire,
under t e direction of an excellent naval architect; and I trust she
will be ready to sail for Algiers (with masts and naval stores agreeable
to your suggestion) early in the next summer. But instead of forty

Ti

five thousand dollars, she will cost the United States, about ninety
thousand, by s Iate estimate; and probably this will eventually rise
to one hundred thousand.
This matter being in so good a train, and contracts made and making
for all the masts, spars, timber and naval stores, we have to lament
the multiplied disa pointments in the pecuni
ne ociations. * * *
your assuming tYle character of consul, a n Y m s h g the Consular
presents was certainly well timed. In a Country where principles
are unknown, or what is equal, have not the smallest influence, it has
been fortunate for the United States that their interests were at so
critical a period in the haads of a citizen who had intelhgence to
discern and confidence to seize the fittest moments to secure them.
As the periods of renewing the consular presents are computed from
the date of the treaty, there cannot as you observe, be any difference
in the expense, by your making the first under the circumstances you
have rnentloned. A suitable person for Consul at a place so important
as Algiers will hardly Be found until the emolument shall be increased;
and this it is hoped may be done nt the Session of Congress which is
next week to commence. The cautions you suggest as to the character
he should at first assume, that of Vice-Consul, or your Secretary, will
be attended to. These obsex-vations refer to your letter of April l T t @
In your letter of April lath and estimate of the 20* of advantages
and expenses of maintaining peace with Barbary, you have presented
an interesting and important view of the commerce of the Mediterranean, and the share we may reasonably hope to attain in it, if we
effect a peace with all the Barbary powers, and form commercial
relations with the Countries bordering on that sea. * * *
It is some time since I received a copy pf your ipstructions to Monsr
Famin f o negotiate a treaty of peace wth T u s ; and a letter from
Ms Monroe dated in September, which I received the 236 ult. covered
a communication from M. de la Croix, the French Minister for
foreign affairs, by which it appeared that a truce, or provisional
treaty, had been concluded with that Regency; the Citizen Herculais
adding to his information, that a complete peace would soon follow.
This peace will be the more valuable if obtained for the moderate
terms designated in your instructions to M. Famin: although you will
have seen, by letters you must since hwe received from Colq
Humphreys, that if indispensably necessary the terms might be
extended. I t will be fortunate indeed, if this important object is
accomplished agreeably to the h t instructions: for the extraordinary
expenses of the Algerine negociations, and the vast losses in various
exchanges t o convert our funds into Cash, may absorb all the savings
in the sums ultimately appropriated for the treaties with Tunis and
Tripoli.
Captain Cathcart has given me an open letter to the Dey of Algiers,
in which I observe nothing improper: if any parts of ~ t however,
,
should appear otherwise to you, they may be erased, or suppressed
in the inte retation, at your hscretion. He brought a letter from
the Dey ad ressed to the President of the United States, to which an
answer is now inched, which the President desires you to present to
the Dey in the fime and manner which you shall-deem necessary and
most accep-table. A copy of it for your information is inclosed.

DEPARTMENT
OF STATE
PHILADELPHIA
December 6'h 17'96
SIB An Act of Congress passed in the last Session required that
Mediterranean passports should be issued from the Custom Houses
on and after the &st of September last. The Collectors were accordingly supplied. Our treaty with the Dey and Regency of Algiers
requires that the vessels of the United States be furnished with passports within eighteen months from the date of the treaty; the indented
margins of our passports will therefore arrive timely, I trust, to supply
the Algerine Cruisers. I now transmit herewith one hundred of those
margins, with six entire passports, as specimens of their form. The
plate for striking them had been hished, and great numbers struck
and issued prior to Captain Cathcart's arrival with the forms you were
so kind as to send me. I also send herewith three quires of printed
certificates substantially agreeing with the forms used by the British
Consul at Algiers which you forwarded, and to which the margins are
annexed, for the use of the Cruisers; five quires of certificates for
Algerine prize vessels, and two quires relative to the health of the
Country. The one hundred margins of the passports will enable
you to suppl the cruisers of Tunis and Tripoli as well as those of
Algiers, sho d peace be accomplished with those powers.
Captain Cathcart thought i t would be pleasing to the Dey to see a
drawmg of the frigate building for him in the United States: I have
had one made, wbch you will find herewith.

P. S. You wiU of course give your receipt on the delivery of the
cargo at Algiers, to enable Captqathcart to receive here the stipulated
freight.

Observ~tionsof Bichard O'Brien on negotiations for peace with Tunis*

9th o j December I796 in the CITYOF TUNIS
This day the AIgerine Vickel sent for me and informed me he

received letters and 50 passports from Algiers. I said I hoped he
would act with dignity moderation and precaution on a business of
so delicate a nature m which the honor of Algiers was so deeply
interested. He said he would - that he would in the morning go to
the Rabatta to where the Bey of Tunis resides - would see the
Bey - communicate the purport of the Deys letter and prepare the
wa for me to have a conference.
6 n the morning of the 10th - The algerine Vickel went to the
Palace and the V~ckelshortly sent for me. I requested Mr Famin
to go with me as he seemed much dissatisfied that the Vickel did not
also desire him to go on this business with me - He acquiesced
We went to the Bey's residence after walking there X an hour I a t
last saw the algerine VickelHe said he had been speaking to
some of his friends - that the Bashaw was busy in the Justice Hall,
& that he would embrace a favorable opp? of speaking to him - I
observed he being the representative of so potent a prince as the Dey
of Algiers he should not hesitate in doing his duty - He on t h
went to the Bashaw, met him going into another room & shewed

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS

him the Bashaw of Algiers' orders and requests & determination
relative to the Bm. business. He returned to me & said that the

Bey seemed much affected as a person very .ybut choaked with
inward grief on the affairs of the Dey of &em giving the Americans
his passports & threats - I observed that the Viokel interpreted
to me that the Dey of Algiers' letter intimated that Tunis had demanded a greater Regala from the Americans than algiers did. that
it was in consequence of the Deys interference the Bashaw of Tunis
had deviated from his fixed demand of 50,000 dollars and demanded
the maritime & military stores - and says the Vickel you had
better agree to give a small regala than keep the affairs in this manner
unsettled - I said I had no such orders, That I should have an answer
& return to algiers and there report to Patroon Grandi That he knew
the orders were positive and could not be deviated from without
the Dey's approbation - The Vickel went to where the Bey was
& shortly after returned & said the Bashaw does not consider you
or MT Fa& sufEciently instructed to conclude this business without
a reference to algiers - I said on this that I or M' Famin was empowered to conclude on the original terms of 50,000 dollars but not
on the nofe of maritime & military stores - The Vickd said that
in his Opinion I had better return to algiers and state these particulars to the Dey - I said if nothin better could be done that I certainly wouId - The Bashaw ca ed for Mr Famin - had some
conversation with him - Famin told me that the Vickel was no
service on the business - says I he must obey his masters orders Will the Bey conclude on the terms which he first proposed & settled
with you? No says he, he will not. M: F m i n had a long conference
with the Sachataps to see if 8 or 10,000 dollars could not be substituted in the room of the Regda The result was that i t was impracticable - The Viokel took his leave of me for the present as
he said he could not be of any more service to me - that he would
go to his home, and commence his letters for Algiers, assuring me he
had & wodd do all in his power on this business and hoped it would
soon be accommodated. Mr Famh said it was no use for to stay
there any longer as the Bey said what signifies my talking on t h s
business - neither the Rice or Famin has owers to conclude with
me without a reference to Algiers - I said wodd conclude on the
original terms but not with them and the note of the Maritime and
mihtary stores. I was determined to have a conference or audience
with the Bey I accordingly entered the Justice Chamber where he
was - went and kissed his hand, and asked him if he would conclude
the peace He said on what terms? I said for 50,000 dollars - He
looked at me & remained silent - I said, will your Excellency admit
of something to be substituted in the room of the Regala - He
said you cannot conclude without a reference to dgiers. I asked
then if he had any commands for algiers? He said he wished me
well. I took my leave of him and returned & began to prepare for
Algiers. Mr Famin and I had a long reasomg conversation - He
was the Tunician - I was the Algerine. I went this evening to
the Algerine Vickel - gave him a letter to forward to Algiers for Mr
Barlow - desired if he had m y commands f?r dgiers to prepare
that I should sail Suddenly & said he might ather give me the 50
passports or return them by the Cour~erfor Algiers

and in charge of negoaahonr with Barbary Powers
(N9

LISBONDeer 16'b 1706.
SIR I no sooner received authentic information that the Emperor
Muley Soliman had seriously threatened to declare war against the
United States, in case vessels under their flag should continue to
frequent the Ports of Saffi & Mazagan, & P than I caused the enclosed notification, NQ1. to be affixed in a public place at the Exchange;
I hastened likewise to address a letter to the Emperor Muley Soliman,
of which the enclosed N? 2. is a copz.; which I forwarded a few days
ago under cover to Mr Simpson a t ibraltar, with a letter to him of
which the enclosure Np 3. is a copy - and I cannot but flatter myself
that the precautions I have thus taken to avoid, if possible, the
disastrous consequences of a rupture with the Emperor, will meet
the approbation of Government
In the mean time, I am much distressed to learn that the Cruizers
of the Emperor have began to carry his threats into execution by
capturing & sending into Mogadore a vessel belonging to the United
States bound from Cadiz to Boston, as you %ill perceive by the
enclosures NQ84 & 5, which came to hand by this day's post. - I
do not expect however that the Captains of our vessels will be deterred from going to Saffi & Mazagan; as I am informed that several
of them upon seeing the before mentioned Notification, exp~essed
their contempt of the advice contained in it, and determinabon to
prosecute the trade. Insomuch that I am persuaded that no measure
which may be taken on this side of the Atlantic at present can put
a stop to it: or indeed any other measure except some positive act
of Government, & perhaps some armed vessels stationed in these
seas for carrying that act into effect, as well as for other purposes.
Government will of course decide how far it is right or expedient
that the conduct of Individual Citizens, tending to involve their
Nation in a war, should be tolerated or prevented. But apart from
this consideration you are alrendy in possession of my opinion of
the importance of our having t~ few frigates in these Seas on 311
occasions, and which o p h o n I cannot excuse myself from repeating
the more particularly under the present circumstances. - * * *

To Josiah Parker, Chairman of Committee on Naval Equipments from Secretary of
War
[PHILADELPHIA]
W a r O&ce January 18'4 1707
SIR In Compliance with your letter of the 21.' Ulto. I have the Honor to submit
the enclosed Statements which exhibit as particular a view of the Material Objects
of your enquiries as could be Obtained without occasioning a delay that might
have counteracted your intentions The measures that have been taken to prepare the Rigging and Sails, and to
procure the necessary stores, and the advances made towards the final equipment
of the Frigates render it probable that they may be got ready for Sea in about
2 Months after being launched.
While on this subject permit me to observe, that if Congress perceive advantages in the Extension of their Marine, or think it expedient that early precautions
should be taken, to secure to the United States a lasting fund of live Oak for
future Use, it will be proper, that Authority should be given for the purpose, as
well
to purchase a Scite for a Navy Yard The probability is that an Article so important to Maritime Nations as live Oak
will be sought after with much avidity and that the land which is clothed with it
may pass into hands that may make its attainment hereafter more expensive if
not impracticable But whether it is aright that the United States should be the purchaser of such
lands is a question which no doubt you have examined - - -

To David Humphreys, U. 6. Minister to Lisbon. Portugal, and in charge of negotiations with Barbary Powers, from Joel Barlow, U. 6. Agent. Algiers

ALGIERS12 Jan? 1797 My DEARSIRI have never since the 9 Oct - found an occasion to
send to Euro e. My communication which have accumulated very
much since t at time will now be handed you b Capt - OBrien.
By him I send the treaty concluded with ~ r i ~ o tI . beg leave to
refer to his verbal communications for the details on that affair.
And I believe you will be convinced that we have done as well as i t
was ossible under the circumstances.
d t h respect to Tunis, I enclose to you the copies of some of the
first letters that passed between Famin, OBrien & myself after the
Bey had manifested his obstinacy & bad faith on that subject. What
has passed since is little more than a continuation of the samepretentions on both sides - But there is very little doubt in my m n d but
the affair will soon be accommodated. You may be assured that the
present war which the Dey of Algiers has undertaken against Tunis
is wholly on account of our Treaty - He will succeed, and our peace
with Tunis as well as with Tripoli will be established on the most
solid foundation.
My accounts on the peace of Algiers are not yet closed. I have
kept back the payment of the 180,000 Dollars to the Dey himself for
a good reason. If I had pushed the Jews to finish it, I must have
given them bills on Leghorn for the whole amount, which would have
occasioned a great loss. And I was expecting for 4 months the
100,000 do1 - from Leghorn. These have at last arrived - about
111,000. - and as the Dey insists on having the whole of his sum
in Algerine Sequins, we are g e t t h them fabricated a t the mint.
And the accounts cannot be closed tdl this o eration is completed.
As soon as this [is1 finished I shall close t e business here; and if
the treaty of Tunis arrives by that time, d i c h I expect, I shall then
leave the country, & forward my accounts to you. * * *

To Secretary of State from David Humphreys, U. 6. Minister to Lisbon, Portugal,
and in charge of negotiations with Barbary Powers

(NQ83.)
LISBON
91*.' 1797
SIR I hasten to inform you of the safe arrival of CaptWYBrien,in

a passage of five days, from Algiers. Altho) he is still in quarantine he
has communicated to me the agreeable & interesting intelligence, that
a Peace was concluded between the United States & the Bey of
Tripoli, on the 4" of Novr last. B e farther advises, that, as the Bey
of Tunis had refused to accede to the terms which had been insisted
upon by the Dey of Algiers, on behalf of the United States; the Dey
had taken upon himself the accomplishment of that pacification. I t
appears he had actually invaded the Tunisian territories, principally
to effect that object. M' Barlow seems to imagine that no other
Christian Nation possesses so much of the good will of the Dey at
present as the United States; and that there is a high degree of probability a peace will soon be concluded with Tunis.
P. S. I have some letters which I wish to transmit to you, but cannot prepare the Copies in time for this conveyance.
Admral Jervis has left this Port. - A Convoy arrived, on Sunday,
from England with nearly 2000 Emigrant troops, to serve in this
Country - & the day before yesterday Admiral Parker with five sail
of line of battle ships, to reinforce Admiral Jervis I t is believed (but not certainly known) that the Expedition from
Brest was destined against Ireland, & has miscarried - Seven Ships of
war had, by the last accounts from France, got back to Brest. Nothing material from any of the Armies.
FebT 1? 24"
P. S. I n a note this moment received from Captn O'Brien (still
in quarantine) be expresses an opinion that the Sophia will not be
able to sail for Philadelphia before the middle of this month - as she
wants cleaning &q He likewise intimates his idea of the expediency
of Mr Barlow's being prevailed upon to remain a t Algiers, until the
Maritime Stores &q shall be delivered there.

Marseilles, it appeared evident to him, She was not bound to Genoa,
as Specified in the Bills of Loading that after useless efforts to induce
Cap? Fremantle to give up the Vessel & Cargoe he was obliged to
send his Crew to Leghorn, & to go there himself, as CapP Fremantle
Would not Allow them either to remain on Board the Frgate, or Ship

A Certificate of Gratitude to Pierre Eric Skjoldebrand, Charge dlAffaires, Sweden,
from Joel Barlow, U. 8. Agent, Algiers

COPY

I Joel Barlow, Agent and Consul General for the United States of

America for the city and Regency of Algiers, certify and attest to all
whom i t may concern, particularly to my much esteemed freind Mr
Pierre Eric Skjoldebrand, charge d'aff sires of his Majesty the King of
Sweden, that on my arrival in this place in the year 1796 for the
purpose of redeeming our prisioners and establishing a peace with this
Regency I was deeply affected with gratitude towards the said Mr
Skjoldebrand, as well as towards his brother Mr Mathias Skjoldebrand,
a t that time Consul general of his said Majesty in this place, for the
singular acts of humanity which they had exercised towards our said
prisoners in protecting them as far as possible against the severities
incident to their situation, and advancing them pecuniary succours,
before the American Government had made any provision for that
purpose, and before there could be any certainty that such provision
ever would be made or such advances reimbursed.
My sentiments of Gratitude could not but be farther increased
towards the said Mr P. E. Skjoldebrand by the following additional
proofs that all his conduct in this business had been perfectly diainterested: - when the American Government made provision for regular pensions to be paid monthly to the said prisoners, he was charged
with the payment & the distribution; for which service, continued for
several years, he refused to recieve any commission or compensation: the said Government afterwards offered him the Consulate General
of the United States for this Regency,
which he likewise declined
accepting.
I shall say nothing of his unmerited friendship to me as an individual; this public certificate not being a proper vehicle to convey the
feehngs of personal obhgation. The sensible heart can only treasure
them up, in hopes one day to find the means of expressing them in a
wa more suitable to the delicacy of their nature.
'$he rincipal objects of my mission being accomplished, and I
being a out to retire from this country, I thought it expedient, for
-

E

199

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS

the honour of my government, that I should make another effort to
induce Mr Skjoldebrand to accept of some acknowledgement on the
part of my country for the services rendered to its citizens. I accordingly offered him a trifling present composed of such articles [valued
a t about $25001 as I thought it not inconsistent with the delicacy that
accompanies the most generous minds to accept. This again he has
absolutely refused; declaring that the consciousness of having followed
the dictates of humanity in what he had done for the Amencans was
a reward which he would not barter for any emolument whatever.
He has thus forced upon me the necessity of offering him this
certificate; which I do with the more regret, as it respects the only

ALGIERS
14 March 1787 To the Minister Pdenipotentiary
of the United States - at Paris
SIR One of the most unfortunate circumstances that have attended
our affairs in this lace has been the opposition and decided e h t y of
the French cons s, who, from the nation they represent, must be
supposed to enjoy an uncommon share of influence. The one who
was here when our peace was made did us all the mischief in his power,
as I took the liberty to expiain to you in my letter of the 24 May.
That man acted in this without orders from his government; and, as
I believe, against their intentions; as they were at that time friendly
to us. * * *
The present Consul of France, the famous Jean Bon St Andr6,
formerly one of the most fiery Satellites of Robespierre, has founded
his opposition on a different principle. When he first arrived he gave
me to understand that our treaty with England was likely to produce
a war with France: an opinion which seemed to afford him a good deal
of pleasure. I n his great zeal to do what he can to produce a rupture
it is probable that he will entertain his government with a relation,
after his manner, of a transaction which has taken place here within
a few days, and in which I concieved i t to be my duty to take a
decided part; as it affects one of the most important principles on which
all the treaties with Barbary are founded: I mean that of the FIag
covering the cargo. (I speak of the principle only as i t applies to
Barbary.) I t is well known that the nations who purchase peace
with Barbary are the carriers for those who remain a t war. And this
is one of the principal advantages purchached with the eace. These
States (contrary to those of Europe) consider it as the aw of nations
that the persons and property of enemies are sacred under the flag of
a friend. If by our folly they should be taught to adopt the contrary
principle, the carrying trade is a t an end. But this is not all: - every

3

vessel would be searched for the property and subjects of Portugal,
Naples, Genoa &c, - and as they cannot read our apers, every
vessel must be brought into port, part of the cargo p aged, papers
destroyed in their eagerness to condemn, the vessel detained a long
time and reduced to the necessity of performing quarantine when she
arrives finally at her destination.

iE

But Jean Bon St Andre, who armed a privateer some time ago in
this place, gave her orders to take every neutral she could find; and,
wherever taken, to send them to this port to his tribunal. A few
days ago they began to come in. * * *
When the Dnne arrived she brought news of an American taken
the same day and likewise ordered to this place. The Swedish
consul and myself agreed to unite our influence with the Danish
consul in vindicating a principle so extremely delicate in Barba
that goods on board a neutral vessel under capture should not
discharged in this place. We therefore agreed - 19 - to use every
argument that can be used with a madman to engage the French
Consul to send the vessel back to Spain or Fmnce, under the responsibility of the Danish consul in case of recapture by the Enolish.
2d!y If we failed in this, to engage the Dey to order her off, alle&ng
that it was a question between his friends that he could not decide
and in which justice could not be d ~ n ehere. 3d!y If he would not
do this, to engage him to take no part in the affair nor suffer his
people to lend any aid on either side; - and then the Danish Consul
was to order the crew to carry the vessel to Marseilles by force, for
trial. And the prize master and four other French men who were on
board might remain on board, or leave the vessel, as they chose.The Sweed and myself agrced to do the same thing when vessels of
our nations should arrive under like circumstances.
We failed in the two first proposit.ions, and the way was prepared
for the third, the Dey declaring to us all that he would decide nothing,
nor suffer his people to act; as he did not like to disoblige his friends
either on the one side or the other. Thus the vindication of the
principle was left in the power of the Danish consul; - and he (in a
dishonorable manner in my opinion) agreed to give i t up, and wrote
an order for the captain to deliver the cargo to the French Consul.
Luckily the order was not delivered that night; and the next day we
were saved by the appearance of a Swedish vessel sent in by the same
privateer. * * * He [the Swede] convinced the De of the
necessity of shutting his port against all such vessels and o ordering
the Sweed immediately to sea; which was done, & the vessel has
sailed. The Dane is likewise ordered to sail; and no more are to be
allowed to enter the port. The American has not yet arrived, though
we are to expect many of them, as well as Danes & Sweeds, before
it can be known that they wdl not be recieved.
You will be pleased to observe that in this business we have paid
no attention to the nature of the cargoes, or what degree of evidence
or suspicion there may be that they might belong to the enemies of
France. The only point was the honour of the flag in Barbary, for
which we pay somuchmoney, * * *
As the representative of the United States in this place, I am
sensible that i t iR m duty to avoid all occasions of giv
unnecessary
umbrage to the be&erent Powers. I know likewise t at Jean Bon

S%Andre will endeavour to point the resentment of his government

Our peace with Tunis is not yet concluded; owing, as I believe, to
the intrigues of the French consul in that place. But I think it will
soon be concluded.
[Postscript, March 151
I open my letter to inform you that orders are this day sent to all
the ports of the Regency to forbid the entrance of dl prizes whatever
that shall be sent in by foreign nations. And a courier has arrived
this day from Oran which brings news of a Swedish vessel sent to that
port by the English, supposed to bc loaded for French account,
which was not suffered to enter, but ordered to sea again immediately.

Circular to the Collectors of Revenue, Treasury Department

(CIRCULAR.)
TREASURY
DEPARTMENT,
A p d 8,1797.
To THE COLLECTORS
OF THE REVENUE
SIR, The depredations, to which the conlmerce of the United
States is a t present exposed, have given rise to a question, .which
being of general concern, is therefore made the subject of a clrcular
communicntion.
The question is, I.T7hether it be Lawful to arm the merchant vessels of
the United States for their protection and defence, while engaged i n
regular commerce.
I t is answered-that no doubt is entertained, that defence, by
means of military force against mere pirates and sea rovers, is lamfu1;-the arming of vessels, born fide engaged in trade to the EastIndies, is therefore on account of the danger from pirates to be permitted as heretofore, but as the arming of vessels destined for European or West-India commerce, raises a presumption, that i t is done
with hostile intentions against some one of the belligerent nations,
and ma cover collusive practices inconsistent with the Act of Congress
June, 1794, unless uuarded by provisions more effectual
than have been hitherto establshed; i t is directed that the sailing of
armed vessels, not bona jide destined to the East-Indies, be restrained,
until otherwise ordained by Congress.
Information has been received that some vessels are arming. by
strangers for the purpose of capturing the vessels of the Uruted
States. The utmost vigilance on the part of the Collectors to prevent the pro ress of this evil is enjoined; where there is reasonable
ground to befieve that vessels are equipped for the purpose of being
employed against the commerce of thls country, they are to be
arrested, and the circumstances stated to this Department.
I am very respsctfully, Sir,
Your obedient servant,
Jun.

DEPARTMENT
OF STATE
Philadelphia May 13. 1797.
SIR The Swedish Ship Jupiter, Captain Olof Schale, having been
chartered by our Consul a t Marseilles to bring our citizens late Captives in Algiers to Philadelphia, and for a return voyage to Europe,
we have lottded her with Stores for Algiers, agreeably to the invoices
inclosed, one of which exhibits the articles and their quantities, and
the other their prime cost, with insurance and freight. This second
invoice is sent you to show how much the stores stipulated will exceed
the estimate formed by M' Donaldson when he agreed to the terms
of peace with the Dey. The most egregious error is yet to appear:
The enormous masts estimated by Mr Donaldson a t only thirty
dollars each, will cost probably five hundred, perhaps considerably
more, delivered a t Algiers. I t is only a large Ship which can furnish
room for them, and then only for a small number. They have been
cut, and partly floated down the Susquehannah; and wait another
fresh to get them to tide-water; and such a fresh a t this season is
uncertain. However, all practicable means will be used to fulfil our
engagements in this as well as every other particular. But even if
we get them to navigable water, on account of the difficulty and
heavy expense of transportation, we hope for ample indulgence in
point of time; and perhaps a favourable moment may be found to
obtain the Dey's consent to substitute masts of a much less size for
a part of them. The frigate building for the Dey we reckoned upon
as being able to transport some of the masts: but from the information I have lately received, i t is a t least doubtful. The Invoice of
prices will also enable you properly to dispose of those articles wich
are no part of the articles originally stipulated, but which were
necessav to accommodate the stowage of the stipulated Stores; and
considering the Oak and pine planks six inches thick cost more than
three time the price estimated by M: Donaldson, perhaps the thinner
planks may be accepted as substitutes. Besides the great difficulty
and expense in procuring the six inch plank, the freight of such long
heavy timber mill be enormous. Indeed if the whole list were revised,
it is possible you may obtain some favourable relaxation. All the
changes suggested are however submitted to your discretion. Nothing is to be done to hazard the good opinion of the Dey, or to excite
the most distant idea of trespassing on his distinguised benevolence
towards the United States.
I have attended to your memorandum of the 12'p of January. A
part of the tea and sugar is on board the Jupiter: the residue will be
sent by the frigate or some other vessel destmed for Algiers.
The pro osition of sending the Dey a complete Master Shi builder
will be we considered: Such men qualified to construct vessel's of war
are not numerous; and perhaps hardly one may be found who is "not
married".
I do not know any objection to the building or purchasing two complete Brigs (or a Brig and a large Schooner, which CaptWO'Brienthinks
more eligible) for the Dey, to be paid for on the delivery a t Algiers.
Captain O'Brien will h e c t the choice or construction of them.
Congress are to commence an extraordinary Session next Monday; and
I apprehend the subject must be laid before them, that they may make
the requisite appropriations of money.

h'

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS

You say "the Dey requires the frigate as soon as possible". She is
to be launched on the 4'p of July next. Captp Newman (late a captive
in Algiers) writes me under date of May 19 that he has been a t Portsmouth to see her, and finds her as "complete a piece of workmanship
as he ever saw". But she will be incapable of carrying twelve pounders,
which you say the Dey has now desired. You will recollect that your
original agreement, accepted by the Dey, was for a frigate of 36 guns,
nine-pounders on the main deck. I n exact conformity to your orders,
I procured one of the ablest naval architects in the United States to
give me a draught of such a frigate and of her dimensions; agreeably
to which she has been constructed. To put twleve-pounde~supon her
would ruin her and disap oint the Dey's expectations. She must now
be finished on the origin Plan, and she will be "completed with guns
stores, powder, ball &r: and coppered".

LAZARET
OF MARSEILLES
18 Aug. 1797.
SIR, I beg leave to enclose herewith such of the letters recieved from
Capt - Ingraham as will serve to give you a general view of the state
of affairs a t Tripoli. * * * I have informed him that in conformity to his advice and the desire of the Bey I have paid to the
Bey's Agent in Algiers - 6000 - dol. in part of the 12,000 -promised
the Bey on account of the peace; and that I have desired Mr Clarke
& Mr Famin to send Capt - Ingraham such articles as he may want
for his own use, as well as some jewelry, cloth &c for presents to the
Brother of the Emperer of Morocco on his return from Mecca. The
Bey's agent a t Algiers was soon to return to Tripoli, and give Mr
Clark an occasion to send.

*

*

*

*

*

*

*

I have written several times to the Spanish Consul in Trjpoli,

to thank him for his friendship to Capt.- Ingraham & to our cause,
and to assure him that our government will not forget its obligations
to him. I beg leave to suggest the propriety of your addressing a
letter to him on this subject. He is a man well known & respected
in Algiers, where he was once a slave. The Dey has a particular
friendship for him.
Captam Ingraham's letters, and other accounts I have had in confirmation of them will naturally give rise to some very interesting
reflections: Firsf. The present Be of Tripoli (who is known to set every
rinciple of honor a t de ance more than any prince in Barbary) rs
Lmming ,owed, . His marine, which before he took Capt Sampson
last year consisted of only two small cruisers, is now almost equal to

B

207

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS

that of Algiers. He appears to recieve such encouragement from
Constantinople that i t would not be strange if in a short time he
should set the Dey of Algiers a t defiance. Though i t is possible
that such a step might cost him his life, yet i t is possible that it might
not, and that one of his first objects would be to break our treaty
which is guaranteed by the Dey.
Secondly. The rupture with the Danes, & the manner in which i t
has been healed, affords a serious lesson. Ingraham says i t might have
been prevented a t first for - 6000 - dollars. I t has cost that
nation in the whole a t least half a million. Their commerce &
navigation in these seas have been interrupted by it for one year.
During this time they have maintained a squadron of two Frigates &
several other ships of war, sometimes blockading the port & sometimes trying to negotiate. And they have had five vessels taken.
Last March one of the frigates came f o Algiers to ask the Dey's
interference, in imitation of what he had done for the Americans.
After some hesitation, the Dey wrote a letter, which I was told was
a feeble one, and sent an Ambassador in the frigate. At the end of
two month's he returned without having accompljshed any thing. I t
was in consequence of the battle mentioned by Capt - Ingraham that
they purchased the peace for - 100,000-401. & a tribute of-14,000to be paid every 4 years. I t is probable that if our peace there had
been delayed a few months longer, so that the Danes had made theirs
first, & we had not been aided by the Dey, it would have cost us a t
least - 200,000 - Dollars.

*

*

*

*

*

*

*

Thirdly. Whatever may be the opinion formed a t a distance, I am

well convinced that Capt. Ingraham's apprehensions of a combination to exclude us from these seas is not without foundation. The
Danes, Venitians, & probably the Sweeds, have already suffered
greatly by our success. It is certain that the Spanish Consul in
Algiers had orders during the whole of last year to drive me from
that place if it could be done for - 50,000 - dollars. The sum was
not sufficient. I t was not more than ought to have been given to
the house of Ba,cry, besides a much greater bribe to the Dey. Mr
HerculJs told me, before he left Algiers, that the French never would
have suffered us to et a footing in Barbary, had they not supposed
that i t was to be un er their wing; but since they found we had done
it without their aid, and found too that our commercial relations were
likely to be strengthened with the English & weakened with them,
they certainly would force us out of Barbary very soon; and i t was
his opinion that they ought to do it. No person I suppose will doubt
but that the English will suffer by our success as much as any of
these nations, & that the d be disposed to do as much to prevent
it. They have hitherto one a great deal more.

8

e

*

B*

*

*

*

*

Fourthly. To oppose ourselves with success both to the intrigues
from Europe and the caprices of the Barbary Princes, it appears to
me that Americans of substantial talents, and salaries almost equal
to those of our plenipotentiaries in Europe, ought to be placed as consuls general in each regency. It seems ~ndispensablelikewise that
they should have a liberal credit for funds, to be applied on extraordinary occasions. And I beg leave to repeat what I once suggested,

NAVAI, OPERATIONS FROM 1786 TO 1801

that it would be expedient that the consuls general a t Tunis & Tri oli
should be instructed to communicate with the one a t Algiers, an to

To Secretary of State from Joel Barlow, former U. S. Agent, Algiers

LAZARET
OF MARSEILLES
24 Aug. 1797
SIR This is to accompany the papers that I have been able to collect relative to the Ship Fortune and her cargo, of which it is probable
you may have had some account either from Mr Humphreys, Mr
Donaldson or Capt - Smith.
The facts, so far as i t comes within my power to relate them, are
these: - At the moment when I was enabled to liberate the American prisoners in Algiers the state of the plague rendered i t dangerous
for them to remain longer in the place; and there was no vessel on
which they could embark, but the ship Fortune belonging to the
house of Bacri, and bound to Leghorn with about 50 Neapolitans.
As the Algerines were a t war with Genoa & Tuscany, I thought it
might be inconvenient to the American passengers that the vessel
should go under the Algerine Flag. I therefore tool< a bill of sale of
the ship in [word mutilated] name, gave her the American Flag, and
appointed Capt - Calder to command her as far as Leghorn. When
I delivered him the Bill of Sale, I gave him an order in writing nearly
in the following words (as my haste prevented me from taking a copy
of it I quote it here from memory.) "Sir, I recieved this bill of sale
"of the Ship Fortune for no other purpose than to secure your passage
"against the enemies of Algiers. I do not & will not own any part of
"her, and she shall not stand in my name after the resent voyage.
"I intreat ou therefore not to suffer this bill of sa e to go out of
''your han s, but to burn i t the moment you arrive in port." I
wrote to the same effect to Mr Donaldson. The ship went to Marseilles instead of Leghorn. My order however for burning the bill of
sale was punctually complied with. How the ship came afterwards
to be put in the name of Mr Donaldson, I leave h ~ m& Mr Cathalan
& Capt - Smith to explain. Mr Cathalan's declaration will probably
be enclosed herewith.
About the first of March 1797 - news came to Algiers that the
ship Fortune, Capt - Smith, had been loaded in Bona for account of
the house of Bacri, destined for Genoa, and taken on her passage
near Marseilles by the English. As soon as I found occasion to send
(March 26) I wrote Mr Donaldson the letter of which the followin is
an extract: "You doubtless know that the Ship Fortune, comman! t ed

"not get it of the English Consul, or if they say one word to the
"Dey of forceing me to pay, I will expose more of their crimes than
"they are aware of. I t is possible that the fear of m vengeance will
"induce them to throw i t on the English. Nothing e se certainly will
"save US.
'[Ihope you understand better than I do the motive that induced
"you to cover that ship with your name, unless she belongs to you.
"And the Jews confess to me that she belongs to them."
The rule universally established in the Barbary States is that the
f l t g shall protect the cargo. * * *
In consequence of this rule, when any property of the Dey or his
subjects, having been shipped on board a vessel belonging to any of
his friends, is taken or turned from its destination, he require8 the
nation, whose vessel i t is, to pay the value of the property a t the port
of destination. On this principle the Danes & Sweeds have had a
number of cargoes to pay for to Algerine subjects during the present
war. And then they make their reclamations on the captors or their
governments. The Danish Consul told me late1 that the English
had already refunded all the money that he ha paid for property
taken by them, which has mounted to a t least - 200,000 - dol.
After these examples it was in vain for me to dispute the principle,
or its application to the American Flag. The only argument for
avoiding the payment was that the ship Fordune was not American
property! and ought not to have borne the Flag. It would be useless
to enter Into the details of the opposition that I made on this ground.
I t is well known that the house of Bacri are the Kings of Algiers,
and that i t is easier to oppose the Dey's interest than theirs. They
promised me at first that as to the cargo, they would recover from
the English Consul, and leave me out of the question; and as to the
value of the ship, she being in M': Donaldson's name, he must recover
from the English government, and pay that house. Though they did
not decieve me with this promise, or make me believe that they
meant to keep their word, yet it was out of my power to force them
to it.
It was unfortunnte for me that during the time of this dispute
the Dey had become exceedingly angry at the delay of our stofeships. He had been waiting with the impatience of a petulent chdd
all winter; and after the beginning of April it became impossible to
speak to him with safet on an subject. He had become so furious
that I went to him on t e 20 o May to try to soften him. I carried
in my hand a letter I had recieved from Mr Cathcart in Philadelphia
dated in novr informing me that the Polaca Independant was to sad
in a few da s Aftar reading and explaining the letter, & desiring
him to call &s clerk to verify the hand writing, I told h
i
m that the
vessel must either be lost a t sea or stopped by some of the belligerent
owers. Says he "You are a liar, & your government is a Liar; and
will put you in chains a t the M a m e , and declare war." Now I
beg all those whom it may concern, not to be offended at good Hassen
Bashaw for this sort of language. There is not a government, k g
or Consul that he has any thing to do with, but what has been saluted
wjth precisely the same expressions, as occasion has offered, during
hrs r e w . It has become the law of nations. As to his threat, it
has been too often repeated to excite much alarm.

Some time before this last ebullition of his wrath the Dey pronounced his decision relative to the ship Fortune and cargo, - that
the American consul should pay, & pay immediately. I was still in
hopes to avoid it,; but it has been impossible. All that I could do
was to obtain a delay from the Jews, and make them declare to the
Dey that the money was already paid, that he might give the certificate that you will find enclosed. I obtained likewise such other
papers as will, I hope, enable us to recover of the English government
the vdue of the cargo. As to the ship and the freight, I likewise
enclose such papers as I am able to obtain; and i t seems regular that
Mr Donaldson, who I understand is gone to America, should pursue
his claim on the English Government; or that you should pursue i t
in his name.

On the 19 July, the day I left Algiers, I gave the house of Bacri a
certificate to this effect: - that the United States are indebted to
them in the sum of - 40387-213 dol. as the value of the ship
Fortune & her cargo; that in case the American Agent does not pay

that sum in six months in Algiers, then they shall have a right to draw
at three months sight on the government for the same sum payable
in Philadelphia.
This busmess has given me in6nite pain in every stage of it. But
it was impossible for me,,in the disadvantageous situation in which I
was placed, to terminate it on more favorable terms. * * *

But in case he shall desire the salute, and the number of guns shall be fired
which he may have requested, they shall be counted and returned by the vessel
in aa many barrels of cannon powder.
The same shall be done with respect to the Tunisian corsairs when they shall
enter any port of the United States.

If any Tunisian subject shall freight an American vessel and load her with
merchandise, and shall afterwards want to unlade or ship them on board of
another vessel, we will not permit him until the matter is determined by a reference
of merchants, who shall decide upon the case; and after the decision, the determination shall be conformed to.
No captain shall be detained in port against his consent, except when our ports
are shut for the vessels of all other nations, which may take place with respect

they please in the kingdom of Tunis, without any opposition, and they shall be
treated like the merchants of other nations; but they shall not carry on commerce
in wine, nor in prohibited articles; and if any one shall be detected in a contraband trade, he shall be punished according to the laws of the country. The
commandants of ports and castles shall take care that the captains and sailors
shall not load prohibited articles; but if this should happen, those who shall not
have contributed to the smuggling shall not be molested nor searched, no more
than shall the vessel and cargo; but only the offender, who shall be demanded

the possessions of the other, the consul or the vakil shall take possession of his
effects (if he does not leave a will), of which he shall make an inventory; and the
government of the place shall have nothing to do therewith. And if there shall

and resort shall not be had to arms therefor, except where such application shall
have been rejected; and if war be then declared, the term of one year shall be
allowed to the citizens or subjects of the contracting parties to arrange their
affairs and to withdraw themselves with their property.
The agreements and terms above concluded by the two contracting parties

GENTLEMEN
This letter I address to you by the advice of Capt"
Richard OJBrien, who understands that in the absence of MI Barlow,
you were so good as to accept an Agency in behalf of the United States.
The Ship Newport is laden with timber (including two large masts
and four yards) planks and staves for the Dey, on account of the
stipulations of the treaty of the United States with him. Some of the
articles are not precisely such as the treaty-agreement prescribed, but
were necessary to be put on board to fill up the Ship and make good
stowage. If not wanted by the Dey, and accepted towards our stipulations, you will sell the articles (not specifically stipulated) here
referred to for the k t advantage of the United States.

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS

215

This is the third Ship laden with naval and other Stores for the Dey
pursuant to our agreement; and we shall continue to forward the
residue as fast as possible. The entire performance of our contract
may absolutely be relied on.
The freight which will be due to Captain Tew on the delivery of the
cargo of the Ship Newport a t Algiers, is eight thousand nine hundred
and thirty two dollars 88/100. He will want a part of this for port
charges a t Algiers, or elsewhere in the Mediterranean, - where he
may go for freight back to America. Such portion as he s h d require
I must intreat you to pay to him; to refund which I shall immediately
lodge a credit a t Lisbon, with the House of Messr"ohn Bulkeley and
son, on whom you will draw for the sum you shall advance, as above
mentioned to Captain Tew. The owner of the Ship, or his Agent here,
informs me that he has an expectation that Captain Tew will go to
St Ubes and take in a load of Salt. In this case, you will only have the
trouble to give to Captwew an order on the Messrg Bulkeleys for such
a sum as the Captain shall request. The bills you may have occasion
to draw on that House may be a t thirty days sight. The Agent of
the owner has entire confidence in Capt? Tew, and that he will demand
no more of his freight than will be requisite to fulfil his orders. The
whole sum I hope he will not want, as i t will be more convenient for
the United States to pay the freight in Philadelphia. If however he
demands the whole 8932 88/100 dollars, you will have the goodness to
pay and draw to that amount, in the manner already mentioned. If
any of the articles of the cargo should be sold, the proceeds will so
far enable you to pa on account of Captc Tew's freight. There may
have been the like s es of parts of the two former cargoes, the proceeds
of which may in like manner be applied. I wish to give you as little
trouble in this business and to ask for as small advances as possible.

U. 6. Charge d'BfFairee, Tripoli

TRIPOLICt@of October 1797.
(COPY)
SIR, I have the pleasure to inform you that the affairs of the United
States in Tripoli is very favorable a t present, as I hold in friendship
the Bashaw and all the head men of this Regency. Our peace made
here by the Spanish consul is on a much better footing than any other
nation that is a t peace with the Barbary Powers. By this our government lays under every obligation to Consul Souza, and our consul,
whoever he is, that is sent out here, can keep our peace for many
years, if he takes great care not to disclose his mind to any other
consul in this place, for if he cannot keep his own secrets, depend on i t
there is no person here will keep them for him, and by that means he
will always be a t variance with the Bashaw, and more over it will cost
government 8 or 10,000 Dollars a year, if they wish to have their
consul respected in this place, and their flag respected a t sea, and not
to have their shipping robbed and stripped by the cruizers whenever
they meet with them. Our government must not trust to the Algerines to hold their peace with either Tunis or Tripoli. If they trust to
the Algerines, rely on it, on the death of this present Dey of Algiers
there will be a war with Tunis, and possibly with Tripoly, in consequence if such a thing takes place, the consuls of Tripoli & Tunis
must be empowered to sacrafice, perhaps 60 or 70,000 Dollars or even
100,000 - sooner than have our shipping captured and our seamen
made slaves of again, and have to seek for another peace, which will
never be as favorable nor on so good a footing as i t now is, besides
the loss of commerce for 5 or 6 years. The Bashaw told the Spanish
consul and me he never meant to make peace with one nation without
making war with another, and I believe he means to stand to his word,
for he has already made war with two nations since I've been here Danes and Swedes - ths Danes has made peace again after the loss
of six sail of shipping which was captured and brought in here safe,
their peace amounts to more than 100,000 Doll9 in money and presents,
besides their being obliged to pay 14,000 Dollars every three years.
They have captured six sail of Swedes already and sent them in here,
there are five cruizers a t sea, and how many more they will capture I
cannot say, there [were] eighty slaves brought in, and nine of them is
turn'd Turks already, they have come to no terms for a peace, altho
the consul is on the spot, till such times as the Bashaw finds what
success his other cruizers meets with. * * * This regency, when
I first arrived here was in a poor state, but now it is on the rise, growing
very powerful. $hey have frigates from 26 to 36 guns, besides a
number of galleys from 6 to 12 guns. They always keep more or less
ready for sea. The Bashaw has received some great presents from
the Grand Seigneur, 2 frigates, 1000 barrels of powder, cannon,
mortars, shot, shells, cordage, canvas, spars, pine and oak plank, and
a promise of as much more as the Bashaw stands in need of to raise
this regency to its former dignity which was the first state in Barbary
Our resent for this place according to the treaties of peace is much
take it
?ma er than was expected, but I hope our r r n m e n t
rnto consideration and send something more t an is put in the treaties
of peace. I t is much better to have the principal people to be our
friends than our enemies, and by giving a trifle to one, and a t d e to
another is the way to hold our ground good in Barbary. We have

DEPARTMENT
OF STATETrenton October 31. 1797.
SIR By my letter of July 18" committed to Mr T. Bulkeley, and
which he has advised me was forwarded to you a t Madrid, you will
have seen that i t was intended to send from America all the money
necessary to complete our Barbary negociations. But the information
of the treaty with Tunis havlng been concluded, and that the price
of the treaty was to be paid in a short time, together with your knowledge of other known demands for Barbary affairs, induced you, to
prevent a subversion of all that had been done, to make eventual
provision of funds in Europe. By Mr King's letter of August 59
received on the 17'? instant, I find that he has secured with the Mess"
Barings, the credit you desired. This arrangement will produce some
embarrassment; as we shall not certainly know whether you will
or will not have been obliged to draw on that fund. Should the
monies not have been drawn, and the Dey's frigate reach Algiers
without taking the money from hence, the consequences might be
unpleasant. If you should have drawn the money from London,
and we send it to Algiers, expense and risk will attend the transfer.
Yet the precaution you took to insure the payment, if demanded,
before the money arrived from the United States, a pears to have been
exceedingly proper and prudent. When I meet tFte Secretary of the
m Philadelphia, next week, we shall consider what is most
advisab e on this subject. Perhaps the Dey's frigate may not depart
until further information shall enable us to decide with certainty.

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS

The failure of guns has alone caused a detention of the frigate beyond
the time of her being ready for sea which was indicated in a former
letter.
One of the two vessels building for the Dey a t Philadelphia I
suppose must be nearly ready to launch. Both would have been in
equal forwardness, if the yellow fever had not again visited Philadelphia; and particularly Southwark, where the two vessels were building.
The mortality waa principall in that quarter. This disease has
frequently of late been called t e plagzle; and as such it may be mentioned to the Dey, to account for the dela in the building his two
Cruiiers. I rely that one of the two d
l equipped and sent for
algiers before Christmas: perhaps in the beghung of December.
The two vessels are under the direction of our chief naval constructor,
and will be built with the best materials.

TRIPOLI4F of November 1797.

DAVIDHUMPHREYS
Esquire
Minister lenepotentiaq f ~ o mthe U. S. of America,
to t h twrt o j Madrid.
SIR, Since my last of the 4*?of October, of which the inclosed is a
copy, there has many striking thugs turned up in Tripoly - such as
would not be credited only by them that is an eye witness to the same.
These people has got so haughty that they pay little or no respect to
either friend or foe. After making peace with the Danes, they took
the Swedes in hand, and has captured seven sail, but one having an
Algerine paasport was given up again, but not without the loss of 3
or 4000 dollars, besides the detention of the ship. They have also
captured an Imperial ship that had the governor of Smyrna's pass.
This ship and cmgo was condemn'd, the cargo sold, and the ship
made EL cruizer of. The ship and cargo worth 84,000 dollars. They
have also captured a Greek laden with wheat. she sailed under the
Grand Seigneur [space] the cargo was taken on suspicion that i t
belonged to a Neapolitan merchant, her papers being destroy'd and
having not*
to prove to the contrary the ship and people set a t
liberty. This IS the proceeding of the g o v e m e n t of Tnpoly. They
pay httle or no regard to any nation except the English French and
Spaniards and Americans, and its fear that induces them to pay m y
rmpect to them. How long they may be friends with the Americans
after their presenh is delivered, I cannot pretend to say unless they
keep a few frigates constant in these seas to keep them under subjeotlon: if they do that, it is possible to hold our peace for some
years, and not otherways. If our government cormders the small

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS

presents that is given for a perpetual peace to what other nations haa
given, they cannot doubt the truth of what I write you now. Depend
on i t that these people is not to be bound under writings. On the
death of this present Bashaw of Tripoli there mill be great alterations
in the regency either for the better or worse and before they can be
brought to love or respect a christian, they must be first taught to
fear them: this is the only method that can be taken with the states
of Barbary by a nation that means to hold a perpetual peace and
friendship with them and without this method's taking place you cannot trust much to the [ms mutilated] and honor of a nation that
thinks of deceiving any christian that comes their way or they think
themselves in duty bound to spoil a christian if possible.[NA. SDA. Disp. Spain, Vol. 4, 1797-1799.1

The United tates of America has sent the fo owing vessels with
stores for Algiers
The Polacre in January last.
The large Swede ship in May Isst.
A large American ship in September last.
The accident happening to the guns destined for the frigate

s a w . Please God said frigate will sail for Algiers in december. I
shall come to Algiers in said frigate, and will have some stores - all
under the firman of Algiers
There is building in this city on account of your Excellency 3
corsairs A Brig to mount on one deck 22 six-pounders
A Schooner to mount 20 g u n s 4 pounders
A schooner to mount 18 guns, 4 pounders.
The Brig will be cop er-bolted and spiked and copper-bottomed. These corsairs is the z e s t aver built in this count and preferable
to an ever built by any nation io Europe - will sayfaeter than any
vesse s, that ever was in the Mediterranean. These vessels please
God will sail for Algiers in March. The great sickness, which happened in t.his country, has retarded the AIgerine business: but the
Government of this country wishes to procure and send to Algiers
the best materials, which requires time to collect them. The United
States of America has heard with the greatest satisfaction your
making the Spaniards and French give up the Polacre and Swede
ship, which they intended to plunder and rob: we have thank God
heard of their arrival a t Algiers. The depredations and sea-robberies
of those nations in un'ustly capturing the American vessels has much
retarded the Algerine usiness: but God is great; - in him we confide,
and hope for your Excellency's lasting friendship.

States of America with that power. You rilf),on the anival of the
Schooner, make the same known to the Dey, in the most proper man-

nw, and receive his orders for tshedelivery thereof. I enclose another
invoice of articles, among which are six shawls and forty four penknives
for the De of Algiers: the rest of the articles in this invoice you will
deliver to ose h Cowen Bacri & Co.
The frigate estined for the Dey will sail in the course of the present
month. Captain O'Brien will embmk in her Perhaps she may arrive
nearly as soon as the HamduUah.
As soon as the HamduUah shall be unladen, Cap$ Montgomery is to
clear and put her in good order, and then you will deliver her to the
Dey, as a vessel purchased for hi use, a t the expense of the United
States. Captain OBrien on his arrival will further explain the object
of this purchase and delivery.
Capt. OBrien has written a letter to the Dey, of which I enclose a
copy, to inform you of the progress made in building the vessels,
which the Dey gave Capt. OBrien orders to procure.
If an opportunity offers for the return of Capt. Montgomery and his
crew to the United States, you will embrace it. A direct conveyance
from Algiers to the United States is hardly to be expected: you will
therefore engage passages for the Captain and crew of the HamduUah
by the way of Alicante, or otherwise, as you shall judge most proper
and economical, unless Capt. OBrien should arrive soon after the
HarnduUah; in which case he w i l l do what is requisite.

To the Honourable the Senate, and the Honourable the Houseof

Massachusetts, that in the month of October in the year of our Lord
One thousand seven hundred and ninety five, after intelligence had
been receiv'd from the American consul at Alicante, that a treaty had
been formed botween the United States and the Barbary Powers; they
sent their Schooner call'd the Elim Samuel Graves Master, and the

directions to proceed from thence to some of the Southern parts of
France for the purchase of Brandy, if information shoud be receiv'd
at Gibralter that the navigation wou'd not be interrupted by the
depredations of the Barbary Corsairs - That on the arrival of the
said Schooner a t Gibralter such information was received, and she
proceeded for Cette a French port in the h$edit<erranean,on her
passage by a gale of wind she was driven into Adge a French port in

226

the neighbourhood of Cette where Ten thousand dollars the property
of your petitioners and part of the cargo of the said Schooner was
taken away in the night time by certain Robbers whom your petitioners
have never been able to discover; that the Super cargo after tarrying
in vain for some time to discover the Robbers and to obtain redress,
purchas'd about sixteen pipes Brandy with the small remainder of the
cargo, and the said Schooner sailed from the port of Cette bound for
Malaga and on her passage was seized by a corsair from Tunis and
carried into that port three days before the expiration of a Truce
which had been agreed to by the Unit'ed States and the Bey and guaranteed by the Dey of Algiers; - That certain Stipulations having
since been agreed to between the United States and the Bey of Tunis,
the Master Super cargo and crew have in consequence thereof been
liberated, and the said Schooner and Brandy restored to the order of
the Consul of the United States then residing at Algiers - That the
Schooner after being rigged as a Brigantine a t Palermo, has returned
to Boston where she now is under the care of the said Parsons as Agent
of the Secretary of State, and the said Brandy has also been receiv'd
a t Boston by the Assignee of the said Secretary, but it has not yet been
decided whether the said Brigantine and Brandy shou'd be restor'd
to your petitioners or whether the United States shou'd retain i t for
their own use -Your petitioners wou'd submit to the consideration of
Congress whether by any laws recognized among nations their property
in the said Brigantine & Brandy has been divested? Whether as the
seizure was during the existence of the truce, it ought not to be deemed
such an infraction of a national compact; as will not vest a legal
property in the Spoliators? but if the legal property may be considered to have been acquired by the seizure yet your petitioners
would humbly suggest, that upon the restoration of the vessell and
cargo, it would not be consistent with the national honour to detain
the same from the original owners, that it cannot be supposed that
the United States would negotiate with the Be for the purchase of a
ressell and sixteen Pipes Brandy for their own enefit especially when
the same had been taken from their own citizens and made prize of
contrary to a truce stipulated between the two governments, That
if the idea of such trafic should be re'ected, no other rational idea
seems to present itself but a ransom or the benefit of the original
owners - how far this is supported by the equitable claims which
every citizen has upon its Sovereign for the protection of a lawful
commerce, when such protection can be grnnted without a public
injury, or for compensation for illegal capture where the compensa-tion
is in the possession of government and can be made by a restoration
of the captured property lour petitioners would request the consideration of Congress. - our petitioners would submit this furthar
consideration, that the same sum was probably paid to the Bey for
the liberation of the captives and the restoration of the property, as
must have been paid for the liberation of the captives only, as will
appear by comparing the sum paid to the Bey with the price paid for
the ransom of slaves only to the Dey of Algiers, as also by considering
that the vcssell and Brandy had the same not been restored wou'd
have been quite useless to the Tunisians. - your petitioners have
also understood that expences have been incurred in altering the said
Schooner into a Brigantine since her restoration, and that wages are
due to the seamen for navigating her to Boston, and also that the said

Brigantine has earnd a freight about equal to those expences, wherefore
your petitioners humbly pray that Congress would take the premises

to be restored to the original owners, as some alleviation of thelr

16'@ December 1797. SIRI have the honor to advise my arrival at this place on the Evening of the 6%''Inst - the day following I landed, and was received by
the Governor His Excell? Alcayde Habu Ben Maleck, as Consul
General of the United States for this Empire, with marks of cordial
Friendship, under the usual complimentary Salute of 11 Guns. His Imperial Majesty Muley Soliman having sat out for Morocco,
the season of the year rendered it impossible for me to follow him there
immediately, accompanied by a su5cient number of Mules to carry,
and Guards to escort the Articles provided, to be presented His Imperial Majesty, in t-hename of the United States; for this reason and
having no lace of safety to secure the Articles of Present here, they
remain a t ibraltar, u n t d wanted. The Roads during the rainy season in this Country are render'd
almost impassable for Horsemen, but perfectly so for Cattle with
burthens, unless at a very great hazard of having every article so
transported, destroyed; - the Governor sensible of this, very readily
sent off a Horseman to Morocco at my arrival, with letters from me for
Muley Soliman and Sid Mohamet Ben Ottman, with an apology for
not waiting on His Majesty untill the Journey can be undertaken
with safety to the Articles compose the Present, which I have not a
doubt but will be well received. I have delayed doing myself the honor of malreing this Communication to you, untill OBcial advice should be received of Muley Solimans arrival a t Morocco, which happy event has this morning been
anounced by Salutes from the Garrison, the Governor having received
the intelligence last Night; - This Prince now Reigns sole Emperor
of his Father's Dominions; and the Country thro'out, is in a state of
the most perfect tranquility, which it is hoped under a Soveriegn of Solimans innate good qualitys, will continue; as a blessing to his People
and a Comfort to Christians they have for some years back been strangers to. -

of the Trial - Gardner (Master of the Mary) pleaded that as one of his
Ship papers had wrongfully been delivered to me by the Captor, he
could not receive the others without it - in my former letters on this
subject, I have told you the strong motives induced me to retain that
paper, and now I am here I can assure you, it was a happy circumstance I did, for some of the Consuls have told me, every part of
the busyness is well known on this side, and that my conduct was
watched. Mr Chiappi of Mogodor writes me, that by the Emperors order the
Brig Liberty and her Car o carried to SP Cruz by one of his Cruizers,
as mentioned in dispatch %? 1 (of Morocco communications) have been
confiscated as taken on a Contraband trade - the Master & Crew
have been liberated. - I am ve desirous of receiving Cutts of the
Mediterranean Passes, and hope shall, before any of the Cruizers
of this Country be fitted out, at present they are all laid up. The Consuls resident here are those of England - Spain - France,
Rolland - Denmark - Sweden - Portugal and Genoa - the latter
also acts for Ragusa, and did for Venice; they are all my old acquaintances, I have the satisfaction of being in habits of strict Friendship
with most of those Gentlemen, and intimately acquainted with the
whole. I have not failed to send to His Imperial Highness Muley Taib,

ColQHumphreys writes from Madrid the 5" of September last, that

Mr Barlow had actually passed his bills upon him without Saying for
what sum; but I suppose for the sums referred to in Mr Bsrlow's
letter to him of the 236 of May last, of which an extract is enclosed.

Co1"umphreys
refers to two of bis letters to me covering some from
Mr Barlow which I conclude give the detads, but which have not come
to hand. But on the
of Sept' no bills had appeared when Col?
Humphreys wrote last summer to Mr King to procure a credit with
the Mess!" Baring's to enable him in that way to discharge Mr Barlow's draughts, the credit desired was from 170,000, to 200,000 dollars.
Hence the 180,000, the amount of my estimate in the preceeding
page, would seem to me as low as can be expehent.
As it is possible, perhaps probable, that the biUs may have been
paid in London, i t would seem prudent to lodge the money in E m e

DEPARTMENT

Decr 2?gt.!'1797.
To RICHARD
OBRIENEsquire
Con& General o f the United States.for the Kingdom of Algiers.
Your intimate accrluaintance with the Government of Algiers, and
their principles of conduct towards Christian Nations, with your
practical knowledge of the means and mode of preserving peace,
render minute Instructions unnecessary. Indeed much must be left
to the discretion of a Christian Consul at Algiers, hence you will feel
the weight and importance of your office, and your high responsibility.
This responsibility is magnified by the addition[al] charge of s general
superintendance of the affairs of the United States in the Regencies
of Tunis and Tripoli. This is hereby committed to you. These
proofs of the high coddence reposed in you by your Country cannot

232

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1Y85 TO 1801

fail to enforce the corresponding duties of fidelity, vigilance, and zeal
to fulftl the great objects of your mission.
I. You well know the great dficulties in the way of executing the
stipulations of our Treaty with Al$ers; while you are sensible that
the good faith of the United States IS a sure pledge of their eventual
performance. You will, therefore, on all necessary occasions explain
these difficulties. Among the causes of delay may be mentioned 1'" The capture, detention, pillage and frequent condemnation of our
vessels by the belligerent powers.
2. The scarcity and excessive high prices of many of the stipulated stares.
3. The real and almost unsurmountablc obstacles in the way of procurjng
other articles, particularly the large masts, which were sought for in the
exterior country, several hundred miles from the sea - and their
transportation to Algiers will be a work of great difficulty; especially as
we have no vessels constructed for that service.
4. The fact that altho' we contended with the force of Great Britain and
successfully, in the establishment of our Independence, and had many
vessels of war on the Ocean; yet these were chiefly the property of
private Citizens, who with thc conclusion of the war, laid aside all
armed vessels, and the Government, loaded with heavy debts in the
war for their Independence have hitherto avoided the expensive e s t a b
Iishment of arsenals and dockyards: Hence the dcbys in procuring
cannon and building vessels of war. The forming of these establishmenta being reserved for the urgent occaeio~~
commenced or apparently
unavoidable.

11. The Crescent Frigate in which you are to embark, you will deliver
ko the Dey and Regency, for whom i t has been constructed and
equipped, confornlnbly to the stipulation of Mr Barlow. After the
Frigate had been so far advanced as not to admit of alteration, M'
Barlow sigrlified that she should be mounted with 12 instead [of] 9
pounders. My answer on this subject of which you will receive a
copy, I presume has satisfied the Dey. Captain Newman is instructed
to keep the Frigate in the best possible order to render her the more
acceptable.
111. The Schooner I-lamddEah, which has iatety sailed with Stores
for Algiers is also to be delirered to the Dey. A copy of the orders,
to the master, captain Montgomery, is inclosed for your information.
This Schooner has been purchased, and the Schooner Lelah Eisha is
now building here, for the Dey , in the expectation that they will not
only soothe him under the past delays & disappointments in the fulfilment of our stipulations, but serve as acceptable substitutes for the
stipulated, Masts, Yards, and heavy plnaks, which are so costly and
difficult to procure, and so exceedingly expensive to transport - the
former, when delivered a t Algiers will cost the United States perhaps
thirty times their estimated price in the stipulations. You will,
therefore, exert d l your talents to effect these object!.
And for your
full information concerning them, the copies of the onginal agrqement
and of the articles for the annual presents, and of the Invoices of
articles furnished in pursuance thereof, are herewith debvered to you.
We shdl be anxious to receive the details of your negotiations in this
business & their result.
IV. The Schooner Skjoldibrand, & Brigantine Hassan Bashaw now
building here on the s ecial Commission from the Dey, will be completed as soon as possigle. Had not the Yellow fever mterrupted the
work-men, both would have been ready to l a u n ~ ha t the first opening
of the Spring at farthest. As the cost of them ISto be reimbursed by

WARS WITH BARBMY POWERS

233

the Dey & Regency you will of course count on receiving the same on
the dehvery of the two vessels. This circumstance is noted as a resourse for any unforseen demands? and because we do not know the
precise state of our pecuniary affam a t Algiers and Tunis. As soon
as i t shall be practicable, after your arrival, you will transmit to fihe
Department of State the best information you can obtain concerxung
them.
V. The building of armed vessels for the Dey and Regency of Algiers.
the Government of the United States would willingly have avoided:
altho' the European Nations have long been in the practice: But the
critical situation of our affairs left us no alternative. In time to come,
however, we shall be well pleased if further engagements of the kind
could be avoided. If demands should be made, you will transmit
them, with full information of all the facts and circumstances which
may be requisite to enable the Government to judge of the necessity
or expediency of complying +th such demands, postponing any peremptory engagements, while i t can be done with safety.
VI. Considering the pre onderanco of the Dey of Algiers in t.he
Councils of Tnpoli, and
weight in those of Tunis; and that the
Consulate of Algiers is of superior importance, the establishments of
the three Consulates in those Eingdoms have reference to this state
of things. Our Councils a t Tunis and Tripoli, will, therefore, constantly correspond with our Consul General a t Algieis, and especially
in all cases of difEculty in relation to our peace with those powers,
and to tho property and persons of our citizens. All pecuniary demands from the two Eastern Regencies are to be communicated to our
Consul General at Algiers, and if they appear to him necessary to be
panted, and are so urgent as not to admit of delay - if also the sums
m question are not of very burthensome magnitude, and they can be
procured at the place where they are demanded or a t Algiers, they are
to be furnished accordingly by the orders or with the approbation of
the Consul General, he transmitting information of the affair, as soon
as practicable, to William Smith Esquire, the Minister of the United
States in Portugal. But if these demands are very extensive, or are
not so pressing as to require immediate decision, the Consul General
w4ll state them, with all the requisite circumstances, together w t h his
opinions, to our Minister a t Lisbon, and await his advice and direction.
The Consul General will, in like manner consuit with him in case of
any difficulties or unforeseen demands in his own Consulat a t Algiers.
And considering that Lisbon is not very remote, probably few affairs
of great moment will arise, in which he will not have time thus to
advise with that Minister.
The same course of proceeding is to be observed in the case of other
demands than those for money from the Barbary Regencies: and even
greater precaution seems requisite before such other demands are
admitted; because in their nature they are more embarra~smg~
or
eventually are likely to be more burthensome, than any pecmary
concessions.
If however the cases here considered admit of the delay, they are to
be transmitted to the Department of State, to receive the decision of
the Government.
I t is not easy to mark the utmost extent of the powers thus to be
exercised by the Consul General for Algiers. The nature of the
barbary Regencies often subjecting the M a i r s of peace and War to be

&

234

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1786 TO 1801

determined by the will of an individual. whose continuance in power
is itself precarious, such &airs cannot always be brought into previous
negotiation with the Christian Nation to be d e c t e d by the decision:
and hence the necessity of that discretionary power hereb vested in
our Consul General for Algiers. But the nature of the rust being
thus delicate and important, he will be impressed with the necessity
of deep and unremitting attention to the duties of his station, and of
adopting dl p a r t i 9 a r precautions, not only to perform those duties
with prudence, dibgence, and integrity, but to render those essential
qualities of his station manifest to his Government & fellow citizens.
In proportion as this great trust is liable to abuse should be the zeal
of the Trustee, to exhibit a fair, candid and upright execution, that
should place him beyond the reach of suspicion.
VII. Make up your accounts half yearly on the last day of June and
December, and where your pecunlay transactions admit of proofs,
take duplicate vouchers, one set of whch you will transmit half yearly
with your accounts to the Department of State.
VIII. The early salary of Four thousand dollars is the compensation for a your personal services and expences.
IX. Regularly once a month write to the Department of State, and
as much oftener as any business or event interesting to the Government shall occur. And every six Months transrmt by a safe conveyance a co y of your Journal m which you will note every transaction,
the know edge of which may be useful to our Government, whether i t
immediately respects ourselves or the other Christian Nations.
X. You will enquire and collect the best information in your power
concerning the commerce of the States of Algiers, Tunis and Tripoli,
and communicate the same to this Department specifying the articles
of commerce, their prices, with what nations now carned on, and your
ideas of the practib1lit-y of introducing our own cltizens tp a partlclpatlon therem, and the precantions necessary for rendering safe and
advantageous.

OoO

Amounting to-- 180,000

dollars, and this sum you will have under your care on board the
Frigate.
By the last intelligence from ColWumphreys, under the date of
September 5'." i t would appear that Mc Barlow had drawn bills on
him, say for 150,000 dollars, to answer which a credit had been obtained by Mr King on the House of John & Frencis Baring in London.
But at the date just mentioned no bills had been presented to ColQ
Humphreys. In this state of uncertainty it has been concluded most
ellegible for the frigate to touch at Gibralter, where i t is not improbable you may learn from our Consul whether the Bills of M Barlow
have or have not been paid. If you can ascertain that they still
remain a t Algiers, then you will proceed thither with the whole sum
in our hands, and there take them up. If, on the contrary, you
frng that the Bills have been remitted for payment in London, then
lodge at Gibraltar the 150,000 dollars, and write from thence to
C0l9 Humphreys a t Madrid - to William Smith Esqr our Minister
a t Lisbon, and to Rufus King Esqr our Minister in London, advising
them of the deposit. You will at the same time advise them of the
rate of exchange Gibraltar and London, and whether the whole or
what part of that sum can be there negotiated either on Government
account or by individuals. The object of giving advice in this matter
to our Minister in Lisbon, is only to multiply the chances of its reaching Mr King, that he may take the necessary measures to draw the
money from Gibralter to repay the Messr"arings.
You will desire
Mr Smith to communicste the advice accordingly. The money thus
deposited will perhaps be safest in the military chest under the orders
of the Commander in Chief of the Garrison and this would seem the
most expedient; because i t is probable that the Government may
pay Mc King in London, and apply the money you deposit a t Gibraltar for the payment of the troops or other purposes of the Garrison.
But if you can learn nothing certain c o n c e m g Mr Barlows bills, yet
seeing the chance is in favor of their having been remitted to London,
it appears advisable to make the Deposit of 150,000 dollars a t Gibraltar. You will then have with you thirty thousand dollars to
answer any pressing calls immediately on our arrival a t Algiers:
and if it should happen that Mr Barlow's b' s have remained there,
ou will then see how you can draw the money from Gibraltar to the
advantage, either by bills, or by sending a vessel for it. The
latter will be attended with some risk which you will duly estimate.
In your transactions at Gibraltar you will of course advise with
Mr Simpson, if there, or with his successor in the American Consulate,
John Gavino Esqr
You will probably find a t Gibraltar some vessels bound to the
United States by which you can write. We shall be anxious to hew
of your arrival at that place and how you have disposed of the money.

Dey and Regency, in fulfilment of our s t i ulations.
We are yet uninformed whether the b d drawn by Mc Barlow on
ColQHum hreys have been presented: they had not reached him on
the 5%of ptember - the date of his last letter from Madrid. In
this state of uncertainty, we have concluded to ship the money, to
pay those bills, in the Crescent frigate, which is to touch a t Gibraltar,
with the hope that our Consul there may be able to inform Captain
O'Brien whether the bills have or have not been presented and forwarded to London. If they have, ho is to leave there, in the guardinnship of the commanding officer of the garrison, one hundred and fifty
thousand dollars, subject to your orders, to reimburse Sir John &
Francis Bming & Co. ~vhoagreed with you to honor M' Barlow's
(or ColQ Humphrey's) b a s , should they be presented. If Cap$
O'Brien cannot get the requisite information at Gibraltar, then also
he is to leave the $150,000. subject to your orders, should the bills
bave been remitted to London, or to his own, if on reaching Algiers
he finds the bills there. I have desired him to write you b different
conveyances of his arrival at Gibraltar, and the deposit of t e money,
which consists wholly of Spanish milled dollars.
You will readily see why Gibraltar was preferred as the place of
deposit. If the Mls should have been sent to London, it was supposed that sum could easily and advantageously be negotiated with
the British Government, which must require large sums to supply
and pay the Garrison and ships of war which rendevous there, if it
could not be accomplished as well or better in the mercantile line: If the bills remained a t Algiers, Gibraltar being within four or five
days sail, the money could readily be transported thither; if it could
not be advantageously negotiated.

To the Assembly of Consuls at Tangier.
Now Know ye, that the Vessels which navigate under Our Flag,
and with Our Passports, are so permitted by Us for the Good of
Nations, the greater part of which are now engaged in War; and who
stand in need of many necessary articles, with wGcb they ought to
be furnished.
I t was for this Reason, and for the general Good that We authorized this Navigation.
We wished to abolish that Coasting Trade as you all know, but
your common Interest restrained Us.
For this Reason We desire, that Our Flag be respected, that i t be
violated by no one, that the Belligerent Powers do not attack i t
themselves, nor suffer that any violence be done thereto; as well in
regard to the Papers ns the Cargoes.
If any Subject of your Nations shall violate Our Flag, we will
have recourse to his respective Government.
I t has been represented to Us that the English Consul would not
give Papers to Our Vessels agreeably to the ancient custom of Consuls
residing in our dominions - We are ignorant of what can be his
motives.
In the mean Time when the Governor shall in consequence of Our
orders, send to any of your Houses, and demand such passports, We
desire that you do give them, and that ou will affirm & authenticate
that those we may give are certainly urs, and sealed with our r e d

Sid Mohamet Ben Ottman, in answer to that I wrote him on my
arrival in this Country - my delaying to go to Court during Winter,
has met His Majest.ys fullest approbation, and both him and Muley

service. I purpose shortly going over to Gibraltar, in order to bring the
Articles provided for the Present to the Emperor, for in these times

of danger even to so short a Navigation, I should not consider i t safe,
under any other persons charge. The Emperor continues a t Morocco, but we have hopes, he may
return to Fez about the Month of March - before then I hope I may
receive a letter for His klajesty from the Government of the United
States, as I am very much of oppinion he will look for one. I find the British Consul has left Algiers, in consequence of that
Regency demanding 60,000 dollars for the people killed, and injury
done their Frigate last Winter b a Ship of Lord St Vincents Squadron. - You will no doubt have {een advised that the Dey of Algiers
some time ago demanded a Frigate from Denmark and another from
Sweden - both Courts have positively refused complying. An English Squadron continues to Cruize off Cadiz, and a Frigate
of same Nation keeps constantly in the Entrance of the Straits,
doubtless with a view of watching the approach of the Squsdron of
French Ships said to be ordered to pass to the Westward. [NA. SDA. CL, Tangier Vol. 1, 1797-1803.1

some means for preventing another return of the dreadful calamit
Your Approbation of what I did in respect to Mr Pintard's k-ig
Mary, is extremely pleasing to me, and I beg you will accept my best
Thanks for your Kind intention of transmitting to me early, the
President's sentiments on the same subject. - The consciousness I
enjoy of the rectitude of my interference on that occasion; to prevent
a very probable public E d , makes me hope they will coincide with
yours. As I trust you will have received my former Advices, i t is not
necessary to say further in respect to the directions you transmitted
me in April last, to draw on Messr"aring of London.
For some Time past both Vessels of Gibraltar, and Spanish, have
enjoyed a free Trade in these seas, when provided with passports
from Muley Soliman - Some Portuguese, and Genoese Vessels
availed of these Passes to carry the Moorish Flag, but about two
Months ago the Algerine Cruizers under this pretext, captured all
Moorish Vessels they met - in consequence of which the Em eror
recalled his Passes, but by a subsequent order again gave them orce.
The British Cruizers have of late taken those Vessels they suspected
to be Spanish, and some have actually been condemned as such a t
Gibraltar. Muley Soliman having been informed of this, wrote a Letter 244
ult? to the Consuls here which was read, and delivered to us on
Monday last by the Governor - I inclose a Translation f o r c u r
Perusal - The English Consul continues to with-hold his cert c a b
to the Emperor's Passes, in consequence of which none have been
issued for some Months. -

I t is reported the ci-devant Venetian Fleet passed to the Westward
in the night of the 7th Instant, but we saw nothing of them here.
I obtained a Moorish Pass for a Brig of Mr Eben Parsons of Boston
laden with Bacalao, when laying a t Algeciras watched by some
French Cruizers - She hoisted the Moorish Fie, and under it
carried the Cargo to Cadiz - The necessity of the Measure, to save
the property of a Citizen of the United States, I trust will justify it.

1798.
My DEARSIR, I sailed from Portsmoutb the Bthof January in the
Crescent frigate destined for Algiers. On the 17th of February we
arrived at Gibraltar, the governor of said place would not take the
money which I wished to deposit with him under his protection, as
the fact is, that the Military Chest was not sufficient to contain it, and
that if it was deposited any where else in Gibraltar, he did not think
it safe, and could not give me the requisite receipts we wanted agreeable to my orders. Finding that the money had not been paid to
the Dey and the Bacris, or to the Bey of Tunis, and hearing of unfavourable reports relative to our affairs with these States, I thought
it for the interest of the United States to proceed immediately for
Algiers. I nve the letters I had for you to Consul Simpson, whom
I met 1ued-y at Gibralter, and sailed from said place on the 20th,
arrived here on the 26tbhaving with us the United States schooner
fIamdullah. I immediately had a long conference with the Dey, and,
from being something dissatisfied he got well pleased, and I fully
explained all our difiiculties which retarded the Algerine business.
We discharged those stipulated articles wlvch were on board the
Crescent, Captain Newman, snd the schooner HamduUuh, Captain
Montgomery, so that this day the frigate and schooner was delivered

240

up to the Dey and Regency of Algiers. The crew of the frigate and
officers I have agreed for tbeir passage on board of a Boston ship.
The crew of the schooner goes in a ship for Charlestown. There is
three American vessels here which fled from the coast of Spain on
account of the French and 12 Spanish privateers. These vessels I
shall obtain the Deyls protection for. The Tunisean Government
was uneasy and t.hreatned us: I immediately dispatched a courier to
MonsrFamin and to the Bey, informing them of my arrival and with
the funds, and our friends the Jews here, the Bacris had sent a letter
of credit to advance the Bey of Tunis the sum requisite if immediately
necessaT. Also I have wrote to Tripoli the Bacris have advanced
here to the order of the Bashaw of Tripoli on our affairs Six thousand
dollars of the stipulated sum, so that I hope we shall shortly give full
security to our affairs in these States. I expect will sail from Philadelphia in April the three Corsairs on account of the Dey, and a large
store ship with timber. Then we shall have a full arrangement on
all our affairs. I t was a lucky circumstance both vessels arriving safe.
The officers and crews made great exertions. We had bad weather,
and, Thank God we and the one hundred and eighty thousand dollars
we had on board is arrived and all well.
I hope you will send a copy of this letter to our Minister in Portugal,
and by three conveyances to the Government of the U. S. I shall
write fully by these vessels, and by all other conveyances. The uncertainty of your receiving this letter prevents me of being more explicit. Hoping you and Mv Humphreys enjoys good health.

To David Enmphreys, U.S. Minister to Madrid, Spain, from Secret-

of State

[PHILADELPHIA]
Department r j State, March 3. 1798.
SIR, Your letter with the original of the treaty with Tunis came
safe to hand, and was laid before the Senate, who for some days have
had it under consideration. There are some exceptionable articles

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS

241

which must be suspended for further negotiation; and with those
exceptions, I suppose the treaty will be ratified.
I n the 12'h article it is said that "The subjects of the two nations
shall be protected by the government or commandant of the places
where they may be, and not by the other authorities of the Country".This is not very intelligible to us, and if it would operate in the
United States, i t would go to vest the separate state-governments
with National concerns, to the exclusion of the general government.
In the same article it is stipulated that if the government of Tunis
shall have need of an American vessel for its service, the Cap: shall
not be allowed to refuse af suchfreight as the governmed s h d be pleased
to prescribe, however inadequate to the service to be performed. And
thus not only that government, but any resident merchants, of whatever nation, who by the well known means of procuring favours,
obtain a Governmental order for an American vessel, may practice
the most in'urious and galling oppression. The l g t QArticle of our
treaty with orocco forms a striking contrast.
But the most exceptionable article is the 14tQ,which would lay
prostrate our whole revenue system; i t is, beside, without reciprocity.
Citizens of the United States may, in our own vessels, carry the merchandize of our Country to Tunis and pay a duty of only three per
cent. But if our citizens transport their goods to Tunis under a foreign
flag, or if foreigners transport merchandize i n our vessels, from any
lace whatever (even from the U. S.) a duty of ten per ced must
ge poid. Whereas a Tunissian merchant may send the merchandize
of his country, under any Jlag, in to the United States, and pay no
more than three per cent duty. - Now you will find that in all our
commercial treaties (except that with spain) we have stipulated to
impose no higher duties or imposts than those which the most forward
nations are or shall be oblidged to pay.
Mr Barlow with his original instructions to Mr Fa&, sent the
project of a treaty with Tunis: of the Instructions I received a cop ;
but not of the project: but I think it impossible that M' Barlow shoufd
have proposed such unequal and inadmissible stipulations: nor can I
imagine that the Bey of Tunis interested himself in than [them]: but
they might quadrate with the mercantile views of the negotiator.
I t 1s presumable that by a new negotiation, thro' CapWYBrien,or
the Consul who is going to Tunis, these articles may be properly
altered and amended. - With the stipulations for money and stores,
altho' the latter will be found very burthensome, the President &
Senate will doubtless acquiesce. When the Senate shall have passed
upon the treaty I shall write you again upon the subject.
Captain O'Brien with the Crescent frigate are by this time, I hope
in Algiers, she sailed from Portsmouth with a fair wind on the 18'p of
January, with one hundred and eighty thousand dollars on board,
most of which he will leave a t Gibraltar, to answer our draughts on
the Messn Barings; unless our Consul there shou d have received
advice that you had drawn for only the 77,640 dollars of which you
have informed me, or other defkite sum. Upon receiving your letter
with this information, I wrote instantly to Par-tsmouth to land dollars
to that amount, seeing we could easily r e m t hence to the Mess?
Barings; but the Crescent had sailed the day before my letter arnved.

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1785 TO 1801

Your efforts to relieve our commerce in the ports of Spain against
ap ressive captures & condemnations are a t once so zealous and so
wei founded, it is to be hoped they will produce good effects. I sincerely regret the recall of such a Minister ss General Pefignan:
for though with the best dispositions towards us and neutrals .in
General, he could not confrod the Consular operations under supenor
orders; yet a French Ambassador with inclinat~onssimilar to those
of Consuls in General might have influence enough to aggravate the
sufferings of our captured citizens.
We hsve lately received such intelIigence from New-Orleans as
induces a confident belief that Governor Gayoso has received orders
to evacuate the posts of the Natchez and Walnut Hills, and to run the
boundary line. Besides a number of private letters, one of which I
have seen, and several of which have been published, I have a NewOrleans News-paper of the 15" of January in which is the following
passage. " M o k u r le Couwrneur de ceffe prowince a y a d recu, par
ce dernier Courier, les ordres de S. M . pour evaczLeT les Postes de Nogales
(Walnut Hills) & Natchez, a pris immddialemenb les dispositions convenubles pour l ' ~ ~ i ofaisand
n , partir k s avis nkessaires, p

The papers relative to the spanish spoliations on our commerce
which Mr Rutledge was.so long since deswed to send hither, have not
yet arrived: The Comrtussioners will soon stand still for want of them:
Pray have the goodness to enquire where they are, and, if not dispatched for America, to forward them without delay.
Not one line yet from our Envoys since they left Holland! We
have London News-papers to the fourth of January, with Paris intelligence to the 3 1st. of December.

As to the account of the cargoes of the 3 vessels that, has arrived
before the Ckscent & Hamddah I finde the marine receI s given for

the real state of our Stipulated Articles in Maratime & Military
Stores which have been received here the Oars taken out of the polacre
Cap! Robertson will be Oblidged to be made good by the U. S. who
must claim these Oars from Spain - the detention of said vessels
proved very prejudicial to the U. S. the canvas got wet was rotted the wet with detention damaged the cordage the Timber was Moulded
& in consiquence both Plank & Scantling were rejected So that I presume S ain shou'd make dl the losses good to the United States The wede Ships cargo did not on many Articles turn out agreable

sorry to see has [not] been attended too with that due attention that i t
ought to have been so that the account of the Clerk of the Algerine
Marine & those of the envoices sent from America differs much &
cannot be ascertained here suddenly or by this conveyance in time
not to occasion suspicion of our own ignorance on these affairs - I
shall have ascertained & the regency certificates given of all that is
received, both of the Stipulated Articles & those of what has come or
is to come on the annuel Stipulation I expect by the return of the
officers of 3 corsairs from this place that all those documents you will
receive & those requisite vouchers & statements The Oars which were taken out of the Polacre the Dey makes the
Spaniards pay for them at his own price but this does not assist us, i t
is to punish the Spaniards & to turn to his own Emolument The Consular presents & the presents of friendship as customary to
give every two years I am Oblidged to take from the Bockries these
presents will amount to nearly forty thousand dollars and it so hapning
that the Consular presents with 2 years presents is given a t one time

for America I sent copies of the account current to the Secretary of

copies of the account current and of dl dis atches whch I sent by
the other two vessels so that our Minister &r Smith a t Lisbon has
full information on this business (that is if he received the dispatches)
You will observe my dear Sir by the account current and my supposed
estimate & the copy of my letter to Mr Barlow that I have no money
of the 180 thousand dollars to spare except that i t would be to destroy
our affairs with Algiers Tunis and Tripoly there is you well know no
great way of reasoning with those people and we should always in
case of a storm have an anchor ready and when we have an extended
commerce in the Mediterranean depend a few frigates in commission
and stationed in Europe is necessary to ve security to commerce
and check any sudden war or our loss will e great. * * *

Dr SIR, I now enclose a copy of the act of the Senate relative to
the Tunissian Treaty. When the armed vessels preparing for the
De of Algiers shal sail, instructions will be given, probabl to Cap*
0'Jrien to negotiate with Tunis concerning the 14" Artic e, if any
others in which i t shall be deemed advisable to attempt an amendment.
These vessels will soon be ready for sea. One has been launched, a
second will be launched this day, and the third in two or three weeks.

NAVAL OP&?RATIONS FROM 1785 TO 1801

On the 4'!' of March, in the evening, arrived the h t dispatches
from our envoys since they arrived a t Paris; and in a day or two after,
the missing numbers, thus wmpleating the series from 1 to 5; and we
have none since. To a copy of those dispatches I now add a copy of
their instructions, which have since been printed by order of the
Senate. The publication of both appears to be producing its natural,
and proper effects indeed it was h g h time that we were roused from
that state of apathy into which a lucrati~ecommerce and a real love
of peace had lulled us. Doubtless the resentments of the American
people will rise in proportion to the long enduring patience with which
they have borne unmerited insults and injuries. I never despaired
of the commonwealth; and I have now no doubt of the requisite
union and spirit of our citizens. Congress are deliberating on the
necessary measures of defence, by sea and land.
The Senate have concurred in the appointment of Moses Young
Esqr to be Consul of the U. S. a t Madrid. Their resolve has just
been received: duplicate commissions will be made out and forwarded
without delay - one by this conveyance, ~f practicable.
We have no late news from the Mississippi: the journey by land
from the Natchez is usually performed in about forty days. Congress
have passed a law erecting a temporary government there, similar
to that for the territory northwest of the mver Ohio; with the excep
tion that slavery is not excluded. This exception will apply to the
slaves e-xisting there aria their discendants, $ to such as shall be
introduced by our own citizens imigrating with them for some of the
States.
Your latest letter received is that of the 14t@of January.

The Dey continues unwell, & as far as I can learn & Judge, he will
shortly go to his long home, there are great parties formed here & I
believe there will be great commotions: The new Dey as customary
will demand to renew the peace, many valuable presents, in Maratime

his demands are not acquiesced with, we shall have war, however I
have great hopes, that m t h 3 corsairs & their cargoes, I shall make a

by the Spanish Consul, the same from under my hand; next as the
Bashaw of Tripoli made n reference, & sent his Ambassadors, with me
to the Dey of Algiers, the Treaty made here by the Dey & Tripoline
Ambassadors & Mr Barlow; this Treat you have, & in sq Treaty
you will h d there is no Corsair Stip ated; it is true the Bashaw
wanted the Brig Sophia, but he did not get her, and I made him no
promise of any Corsair; the Spanish Consul & I thought that a small
Schooner of 8 or 10 Guns, wou'd not be amiss to the Bashaw, as it
wou'd soften & moilerate, his prtssions, which seemed some thing hurt
in making partly a forced Peace, this circumstance I mentioned fully
to Mr Barlow, he disapproved of it; I still thought it my duty, to
represent this business to Congress; this I did personally, & h d y
they did not approve, or disapprove-what I proposed, * * *
As to what the Rice IRaiz] of the Marine said of his having any
conversation with me relative to a Corsair, or relative to the Spanish
Consul, as god is my Judge not one word passed, on the subjects I
went to see him as customary, & took with me the Dr[a]goman &
Macaiah, & a Regala which cost 180 Sequins, he got this Lunchian, &
then declared how much he was & wou'd be, the friend of the Americans, it is his tricks & Jealousy, seeing Frigate & Schooner here for
Algiers, & the three expechd ones which we give in Lieu, of the vast

I visited Fez at my departure from Meguinez, and had the satisfaction at my arrival there, to find a House, and an abundant daily
Supply of Provisions, provided for me by His Majest>y1sSpecial
Command.
Having thus detailed particulars for your Information, I shall only
detain you further to add, that His Imperial Majesty gave the strongest proofs of his wish to maintain Peace & good Friendship with the
United States. I a m happy to tell you there was not a Syllable said on the subject
of Military Stores.
The Portuguese Ambassador has just returned from renewing with
Muley Soliman, the Treaties between His Nation and Morocco, and
we have now here an Ambassador from Denmark on the same Business - Their Presents are very considerable - The former had
160 Mules, and 50 Camels - The latter employes 140 Mules We daily expect the Swedish Ambassador; that from Spain is named,

has come out with the Presents to Algiers he promised as makin
Peace here that our government would send to this Regency a sm
Cruizer besides the other Presents this was promised before the
Bashaw the Spanish Consul and all the leading men of this Regency
but since his arrival in Algiers the Bashaw sent an Ambassador to
the Dey of Algiers this man saw M OIBrien and asked him what time
the Bashaw of Tripoli was to get his Presents He told the Ambassador

A

that the Presenb were ready as soon as the winter would permit them
to come forward He asked him if the Brig was to come at the same
time as the Cruizer was expected to be a Brig Mr O'Brien seemed
much surprized and replied that he knew nothing of any Brig or
Cruizer that was to be sent here and that if any such agreement was
made i t must be between the Bashaw and Spanish Consul that the
Bsshaw must look to His Catholic Majesty or Consul Resident a t
Tripoli to fulfill any such agreements This the Ambassador reported
on his return to Tripoli Such a reply made to the third man of this
Regency is very much against our affairs here If M' O'Brien thinks
that he can secure our Peace through the influence of Algiers in
Tripoli he is greatly deceived and if he has informed our Government
that he can he has led them into an error that will cost Government
some thousands of Dollars to extricate themseves out of it again
You may depend on i t that the Algerines have no influence over this
Regency whatever they may have over Tunis they must hold the
confidence of each Regency seperate they must give greater presents
to this Regency than what is appointed already if they wish to hold
their peace good in this place and not depend on the Presents that's
coming and Algiers to hold a perpetual peace in Tripoli be assured i t
never will be the case till such time as the United States keep a force
in these seas to keep these people under subjection and less than
three good frigates mil not answer and one to visit these ports every
3 or 4 months In Tunis they only wait for our Peace to break here
that they may do the same If our Government considers well who
they have to deal with they will not hesitate a moment to fit out a
few frigates for these seas to protect their commerce If not Government will too soon find the necessity they will have of doing it and
perhaps when too late Consider we have not Christians to deal with
but Turks If they are our friends it's by the force of money or the
force of arms Money is the surest at present. Proposals have
already been made by the Bey of Tunis to break our Peace here that
they may do the same.

DEARSIR,Your esteemed favour of the 19th June I rec'd the 3 4

instant I am much obliged to you for your information but is sorry
that you and M: Smith did not receive my last letters I had expected
answers thereto The Spanish courrier remained in Spain two months
and I am much afraid these letters have miscarried indeed i t is the
fate of many in those extraordinary times.
I wrote you that I received letters from Tripolia informing me that
our &flairsin that quarter are something gloomy on account of the
detention of the stipulated stores and that the Bashaw of Tripolia
threatens much I have wrote by several conveyances to Tripolia and
have had no letters from thence since May.
The Potent Dey of Algiers is very uneasy and anxious to see the
expected corsairs.
The Bashaw and government of Tunis are interested very much to
have Mons: Famin to be the American Consul and indeed to remove
him contrary to that governments inclination would be n very expensive and difEculb an affair. When the corsairs arrive which I expect
daily I shall see what can be done on this business relative to Tunis.
Since my learing the U. S. what you have communicated to me as
an extract from the letter of the Secretary of State of the 13%of April
relative to the corsairs is the only account with certainty that I could
count on since my arrival in this country And during the time I have
been here I have considered myself or our affairs with Barbary like
unto a ship in a gale of wind trying if possible to keep within the
latitudes prescribed to me in my orders and be convinced my desr
Sir considering all circumstances I have done every thing that possibly
lay in my power and have warded off much difficulties and not untd
the arrival of the expected corsairs in Algiers shall I be able to have
an adjustment with the regency on our affairs depend we must act
with more energy.
The Bacris and Busnahs make many enquiries of me relative to
the price of the ship Fortune and car o, valued a t 40,987 Dollars I
have repeatedly stated this affair to t i e government of the U. S. and
have as yet no answer. I have wrote full to MT Smith by this

Relative to the detention of the Vessels destined for Algiers, I have
to inform your Excellency that the Winter in America has been so
severe, that no Carpenters work cou'd be done, which retarded the
business for Algiers and Tripoii, something more than was expected:
My last letters from the American Ambassador a t Madrid informs
me, that the Vessels were expected to sail, from America destined for
Algiers about the latter end of July, & that all the Stores Stipulated
for Tripoli by the Treaty, & with the Consul, wou'd come under

dispatch for Tripoli.
I n consi uence of this information, I expect shortly to see them

I was a t a loss to determine what o y h t to be one. However, I had
concluded to detain Mr Murrays ship, loading for Algiers, until the
three armed vessels bound thither were ready to convoy her. S i
I had come to this conclusion, this m o m g , Mr Murray fortunately
called upon me. I observed to him, that I o

ship would have been ready to take in her loading ong before she came
round to Philadelphia; and in t.hat case the three armed vessels would
hnve been also got ready and sailed before the yellow fever dercmged
all business; that this delay of bis Ship induced me to order the armed
vessels to receive no more men than were requisite to keep them in
port; and that now it was impracticable to man them: that probably

in two weeks such a change as to the fever might take place as would
enable us to proceed; and then as much dispatch as possible should be
given.
hlr Murray acquiesces willingly; and will give orders to delay manning his ship: he is equally anxious with us that she should go under

you may see him, and converse about the ships bringing back the

SIR I have to inform you that on the 5thIns? was Sent into
this port by an Algerine Corsaire of 16 Guns the Brig May,
belonging to Philadelphia Joseph Isreal master, with a valuable
Cargo of wines which Cost. in St Lucar. in Spain 18 thousand
dollars. Consigned To James Yard Esqr of Philadelphia.
Said Brig had an American Register $ 9 Sea letter, and unfortunately no Meditteranian passport.
"This Vessel haveing no Meditteranian pass. by the Algerine

again &P - that any Vessel without a pass. would be Condemned, and that no Consular Certificates Should with him or
his people be SuÂ£Ecient to Save either Vessel Or Cargo - and
for me to give this information to the United States
I have examined fully our passports, and find them defective
in Consequence. I Send you with these dispatches a Spanish
Meditteranian pass. which I think much Superior done than.
Those of the U S - our passes is too long & broad the great
Breadth the more liable to Error, and therefore, the Cut or
top which the barbary Corsairs has does not agree with that
nicety that is requisite and with the pass. which the hiercht
Vessels of the United States has in Consequence it is the
Custom here, and all nations at peace with those people has
Submited to it. That when the top does not exactly agree
with the bottom that the Cargo is Condernnd - and m Consequence of these very visable defects in the present American
passports many of our Vessels will be met with and unavoidably
theire Cargoes Condemned. This requires remidying immediatly and I Should propose Something Similar to the Spanish
pass. on better paper, or on Such parchment as would be thick
not liable to Shrink or extend, One part being damp the other
part perhaps folded & dry, would Occasion the top not agreeing
with the bottom, and in Consequence a due Cargo. government gives both top & bottom & if the[y] do not agree & in
Consequence the Merchants Suffer will the[y] not blame theire
government, which gave them the pass will the[y] not Sue BE9
recover damages from the government.
I inclose you an american pass & 2 tops or Cuts to Shew you
the defect and I point out the necessity of remedying it. The
NQ 1 on top and bottom of the American pass being kept
Close or on the line. The top is longer then the bottom by
1/10'!' of an inch and this defect will be the means of Confiscateing many A Cargo if not remedied As the french Spanish and British has taken and Condemned
& Sold So Many American Vessels the ] haveing of Course with
them theire Meditteranian pass. 0 Course many of those
Vessels has been resold to other nations & of Course the[y]
have many of our passports. Under this pretence we Claim
i t as a right to Change our passports on this plan which I
presume to Suggest to you Sir, takeing 18 Months for all
American Vessels to have the new pass. given out, and the
Same time, for the Old pass. to be good untill the Vessels
has rocured the new and as the[y] have the new the[y] need

the officers and crews of the three armed vesse s destined thither.
Capt. Geddes informs me that the Sophia is not calculated to be
mounted with the complement of cannon proportioned to her tonnage
on account of the height of her deck: but that she could take on board
a few carriage guns. Carronades would be best, if we could get them.
I beg you immediately to consult with Capt. Geddes and arm her in
such manner as you and he shall think best.
I understand that Captain Maley is read for sea, or can be ready
in two days. I have concluded that he s ould sail with the large
Store Ship, nnd convoy her to Algiers. The ship being a dull sailer,
by having the start of the other vessel by a fortmght, or ten days, she
may arrive about as soon as the other two armed vessels and the
Sophia. Captain Geddes says the Sophia wants a mainmast and perhaps some spars, and a pump. I shall rely on your providing these

Captain Robinson expressed a desire to have two or four of Maley's
guns, with amunition, put on board his ship; informing at the same
time that his owners refused to make any kind of provision for
8I'miIlg him.
I see but one objection to his request - that his ship is a dull sailer,
and might be taken, when Maley's Schooner might escape from a
superior force; whereby so many guns, adapted to the Schooner might
be lost. I would therefore prefer putting two, or even four other guns
on board the EIero, which might be taken out a t Algiers, and put into
the hold of the Sophia for ballast.
I will thank you for an immediate answer concerning the vessels
destined for Algiers.

SIR, The Schooner Lelah Eisha being Armed, and Captain Maley
being ordered to defend her and whatever she has under her convoy,
I thought it prudent that he should be furnished with a Commission
as a Naval officer in the service of the United States. I have accordingly made out one for him as a lieutenant in the Navy, and now
inclose it. You will have the goodness to get the War-Office seal
afied to it, before you send it to Maley. At the same time he should
be informed that the Commission is designed only for the present
voyage, and not to ground any claim for permanent employment.
Altho' his good conduct in his present undertaking will recommend
him to the further attention of the Government. All the papers now
transmitted herewith for him are noted below. I presume he will
have obtained a sea letter, Mediterranean passport, clearances and
other customary papers (Register excepted) from the Custom House.
I wish you to ascertain this, and see i t done, if not alreadyaccomplished.
You will write of course to Capt. OIBrien, and send him invoices of
all the articles on board, and copies of the invoice of the cargo of the
ship Hero, for which I inclose a passport, leaving a blank for you to
insert the master's name, which I have forgotten. If as 1 have suggested to Mr Humphreys, the Captain of the Hero puts guns on board
her, he will consider whether he had not better take out s commission,
a t the Custom House, to secure him against being treated as a pirate,
in case he fights and should be taken. I t will cost him but some triflin
fee; and I suppose he knows people enough in Philadelphia who wil
be his bondsmen for observing his instructions as commanding (L
private armed vessel.

Instructions to Lieutenant William Xaley, commander of the armed Schooner

You being appointed to the command of the armed Schooner above named,
are to proceed forthwith to the City of Algiers, and there deliver her with her
guns, tackle apparel and Stores to the Deg of Algiers, for whom she hm been
built, armed and equipped, accordirsg to the directions you s h d receive from
Richard O'Brien Esquire, the Consul General of the United States of America,
a t that City to whom as soon as poasibh you will make known your arrival.
As you have a crew competeut to the defence of the Lelah E i s b against ordinary cruisers, so you are to defend her accordingly against d l attacks but those

266

of superior force. You are therefore to prepare your officers and crew for such
defence and maintain the necessary order and dicipline among them for this
object as well as for the safe navigating of the Schooner to her destined port.
The Ship Hero, laden with timber and Stores on account of the United States,
to be delivered st Algiers pursuant to the Stipulations between that Regency
and the United States, I presume has not yet sailed, if so, you are to take her
under your convoy.
Besides the warlike and other equipments properly belonging to the Lelah
Eisha, there are certain Stores by way of Cargo, which are also for the Dey of
Algiers in pursuance of the stipulations above mentioned. The invoice of these
articles, as well as an inventory of every thing properly belonging to the Schooner,
you wiU take with you and deliver to Captain O'Bricn our Consul a t Algiers,
whose orders respecting the delivery of the whole you will strictly observe; or
in his absence, the orders of the person left there in charge of the officers of the
United States.
The orders for using your arms, you will observe point only to the defence of
the Schooner under your command, and the protection of the Ship Hero, under
your convoy. You are therefore not to give chase to or attempt to take any
vessel you may meet with. Nevertheless, should you meet a t sea with any
vessels of the United States, in the hands of French captors, you may retake them.
And you will understand that it is against the French Cruisers, that the orders
for defence are mainly intended. The Government of that nation having laid
aside all regard to the law of nations, and the most plain and acknowledged
principles of justice in the arrets and regulations it has made in regard to the
capture and condemnation of neutral vessels, and especially those of the United
States. But you will consider well the strength of such captured American
Vessel, and attempt nothing a t the risque of the Lelah Eisha or of the Ship Hero.
So likewise you may take under your protection any American vessels holding the
same course with you. I n case of a recapture you are not materially to deviate
from your proper course, nor eesentially diminish the force of your crew.
I t is expected that the other armed vessels and the Bdg Sophia will reach
Algiers nearly as soon as the Lelah Eisha, and that the crews of the whole will come
home in the Sophia.
Relying on your vigilance, bravery and prudence, I have only to wish you a
prosperous voyage to your destined port, and a safe return to your Country.

If visited by a European vessel of War of Superior force, and your papers are

under my hand and seal: If by any cruiser of the Barbary powers, you will exhibit
your Mediterranean passport, and the passport of the Dcy of Algiers in the
Turkish language and under the Dey's Seal. These ought to satisfy any vessel
of war which may visit you. If however other papers shall be required, you may
exhibit the inventory of the Schooner and her equipment,, the invoice of goods
and sbores on board her, your clearance and any other customary papers. If
you should have an engagement with any other armed vessel, and your right of
fighting should be questioned, you will show your Commission, and your instructions to fight and defend your vessel and convoy.
If not inconvenient to touch a t Gibraltar, you may do it and make known your
destination to our Consul, John Gavino Esqr If any unexpected change should
have taken place to render your going to Algiers improper or unsafe, he can
inform you: and in this case you will secure your vessel until you can get advice
from Captain Richard O'Brien our Consul a t Algiers, how to proceed; contriving
to let him know as soon as possible your situation. I n such case also you will get
Mr Gavino to write an account of it to Colq Humphre s our Minister a t Madrid,
and to William Smith Esqr our Minister a t Lisbon. &at they or either of them
shall finally advise, you are to do. But this caution is suggested only becauae it
is possible (for it is not probable) that there may be reasons to forbid you t o
proceed to Algiers.

If you should fall in on the coast of Morrocco, off Tangier, you will there find

Algiers is so very s d , and the danger 80 great of meeting with French privateera
near the Streights mouth, seeing they frequent the Spanish ports of Algeciras on
one hand and Ceuta on the other - if the wind should be favourable it will he hest
for you to push forward and go directly to Algiers.
The letters and packets addressed to Mr Simpson and Mr Gavino you will
contrive to convey to one or the other of those gentlemen, either going or returning:
but do not go out of your way to deliver them t o either, if you bring the letters and

Instructions to Bichard O'Brien, U. S. Consul General, Algiers; William Eaton,
U. S. Consul, Tunis; and James Leander Cathcart, U. S. Consul, Tripoli, from
Secretary of State

By the powers herewith delivered to you, from tho President of the
United States of America, you are authorized to confer, negotiate and
conclude with the Bey and Regencv of Tunis, on the alterations to
be made in the Treaty between the United States and that power as
arranged in the month of August 1707, by the Agency of Joseph
Etienne Famin who was employed by Joel Barlow Esqr Agent and
Consul General of the United Stat,es a t Algiers.
The important object of discussiorl arrises, out of the fourteenth
article of that Trenty of which the following is a translation.
"Article fourteenthJ'
"The citizens of the United States of America who shall trnnsport
"into the Kingdom of Tunis the Merchandize of their country, in
"the vessels of their nation, shall pay three per cent duty. Such
"as may be laden by such citizens under a foreign Flag coming from
"the United States, or elsewhere, shall pay ten per cent duty: Such
"as may be laden by foreigners on board of American vessels, coming
"from any place whatever, shall also pay ten per cent duty. If
"any Tunissian Merchant wishes to carry merchandize of his country,
"under any flag whatever, into the Unitcd States of America, and on
"his own account, he shall pay three per cent duty."
This article is subversive of our great revenue system: it is besides
without reciprocity. I t cannot be important to the Bey and Regency,
tho' ruinous to us.

?TyARS WITH BAIZBARY POIVERS

269

The revenues of the United States arise chiefly from duties on goods
imported. These duties generally exceed ten per cent. They are
imposed on our own merchants; and increased on the Merchants of
foreign nations. Our treaties with those nations stipulate that no
higher duties shell be paid by their subjects, than by those of the most
favoured nation. Consequently if this article in the Treaty with
Tunis should be ratified by the American Government, the duties
on all the goods imported into the United States by the subjects of
those foreign nations, must be reduced to three per cent. This would
necessarily involve the reduction of the duties imported in our own
vessels, or our whole na.cigation would sink under the unequal burthen.
This sacrifice then, it is impossible to make. m e should thereby
deprive ourselves of the means of supporting ciur own government, of
paying our public debts and even of fulfilling our engagements with
the Bey and other Barbary powers. T X l e no advantage would arise
to the Bey and his proper subjects; probably a few European and
Jewish Merchanfs settle[d] at Tunis would alone he benefitted.
For these reasons, the President cannot apprehend any d i c u l t y
in your obtaining the Bey's consent to abolish the fourteenth article
before mentioned. In its place may be substituted a stipulation
that the commerce of the United States with Tunis, nnd of Tunis
with the United States, shall be on the footing of the commerce of
the most favoured nations for the time being, respectively. At all
events the fourteenth article must be rejected, if war should be the
consequence. This evil, however, by every soothing and pursuasive
measure, you d l endeavour to prerent. Should it nevertheless be
insisted on, i t will evidently be for the purpose of extorting further
stipulations for the delivery of money or stores: but the dcmand must
be resisted. As the article is destitute of any reasonable foundation,
without a precedent in any treaty with any other Barbary Power,
and strikingly wanting in reciprocity, a submission to it wouid.be
dishonor[a]ble to the United States. If to prevent a war any t h n g
should be added to the very burthensome contract already made,
that addition should not have any reference to the fourteenth article,
but be stipulated at large, on the conclusion of the new article or
articles wbch you may negotiate.
The Senate have advised the ratification of the treaty, with the
exce tion of the fourteenth article alone: but the eleventh & twelfth
artic es are objectionable. I n firing salutes in the port8 of the two
powers reciprocally, to return gun for gun will be proper: but as the
Tunissian vessels of war would probably never enter the ports of the
United States, while the vessels of war of the latter were likely often
to enter the ports of Tunis, to sti ulate for the donation of a barrel
of powder for every gun which sht 1l be received for the salute, was to
authorize the Ievylng of R contribution.in a way not very honorable
on either side. I t will therefore be desvable to expunge thls stipulation; and to confine this article to mutual salutes, gun for gun: and
it will be very well to limit the number to jijteen, the federal salute.
The twentieth article of the treaty with algiers requires a mutud salute
of twenty one guns: and if there be any motive to induce the Bey of
Tunis to require a salute of more than fifteen guns, the number-may
be increased to twenty one. If nevertheless the Bey should perslst m
claiming a barrel of owder for every gun fired in his forts, for a salute
to a vessel of war o the United States then it will be of more conse-

7

?

270

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1785 TO 1801

quence to limit the number of guns to at least fifteen, and at most to
twenty one.
In the twelfth article i t is stipulated that the "subjects or citizens
"of the two nations shall be protected by the Government or Com"mandants of the places where they may be, and not by the other
"authorities of the Country." This is not very intelligible. Possibly
it may mean that the officers on the spot shall furnish such protection,
without obliging the United States in the Tunissian dominions, on the
subjects of Tunis in the United States to seek i t a t a distance, if the
seat of Government be distant: but if such protection be with-held
by subordinate officers, the persons needing protection ought to be
forbidden to resort for justice to the chief authority in each nation.
But the clause most exceptionable in this Article is that which permits the gouernment of Tunis to compel an American Captain to put
his vessel into its service, a t such freight as the Government itself
shall prescribe. They will put it in the power of any merchant resident a t Tunis who has the ear of the Bey or one of his chief officers to
command the service of American vessels for compensations wholly
inadequate and unreasonable. The fourteenth Article of the Treaty
with Algiers is proper and honorable. "Should the Dey want to
"freight any American Vessel that may be in the Regency or Turkey,
"said Vessel not being engaged, in consequence of the friendship sub"sisting between the two nations, he expects to have the preference
"given him, on his paying the same freight offered by any other nation."
The three Articles in question may be changed into the following
forms.
Article XI
'When a vessel of war of one of the parties shall enter a port of the
'other in which there is a fortification, she shall be saluted with fifteen
'Guns,which salute the vessel of war shall return gun for gun.'
Article XI1
The h i t part may stand as it is, as far as the word (in the English
translation) "which may extend to merchant vessels, but [not] to those
of war )'- After which, the Article may be thus continued - 'The
'subjects and citizens of the two nations, respectively, shall be pro'tected in the places where they may be by the officers of the Govern'ment, there existing; but on failure of such protection, and for redress
of every injury, the party may resort to the chief authority in each
'country, by whom adequate protection and complete justice shall be
'rendered.'
'In case the Government of Tunis shall have need of an American
'vessel for its service service vessel being within the Regency, (and
'not previously engaged), the government shall have the preference,
'on its paying the same freight as the Tunissinn Merchants usually
'pay for the same service; or at the like rate, if the service be without
'a customary precedent'. - The words in hooks [parentheses] (and
not previously engaged) if objected to, may be omitted.
Article XIV
'Allvessels belonging to the citizens and inhabitants of the United
'States shall be permitted to enter the dserent ports of the Kingdom
'of Tunis, and freely trade with the subjects and inhabitants thereof

271

m7ARS WITH BARBARY POWERS

'on paying the usual duties that are paid by all other nations a t peace
'with the Regency. In like manner a31 vessels belonging to the sub'jects and inhabitants of the Kingdom of Tunis shall be permitted to
'enter the different ports of the United States, mid free1 trade with
'the citizens and inhabitants thereof on paying the usua duties that
'are paid by all other nations at peace mth the United States.'
Or if preferred, the fourteenth article may be in the following form.
'The commerce of the citizens and inhabitants of the United States
'with the Kingdom of Tunis, and of the subjects and inhabitants of
'the Kingdom of Tunis with the United States shall be on the footing
'of the most favored nations for the time respectively.'
Some such form is indispensable: i t is impossible to place the commerce of the Tunisian subjects on a better footing than that of the
most favored nation; and there must be an exact reciprocity in the
stipulation.
A co y of the Act of the Senate on this subject is inclosed. By that
you wif see that m alteration in the fourteenth article only is essential: but you will aim a t the proposed alterations in the eleventh and
twelfth articles.
The Bey and chief officers of Tunis have probably an erroneous idea
of the cost of the naval and military stores stipulated to be delivered
a t Tunis by the United States. Subjoined is an estimate of their
probable cost, so far beyond their own estimate, that perhaps for the
amount of the latter in money, with the addition of some thousands
of doUars, they would release the United States from the obligation
to deliver those stores. Without intimating what will be the probable
cost to the United States to deliver the stores at Tunis, you may offer
the amount of the Tunisian estimates, viz, thirty five thousand dollars;
with the addition of twenty five thousand dollars; if that be not accepted you may add twenty ihousand dollars more; if this also should
be rejected, propose at once as your highest and final offer One Hundred fhousand dollars in lieu of the stores and all other demands for
the peace.
If the delivery of the stores be finally insisted, and the alteration of
the fourteenth article should be refused without an additional stipulation, you may go as far as five thousand dollars in rash, payable in
six or rat.her in nine months, or immediately, if it be indispensable, and
the sum can be procured on the credit of the United States. But this
sum should not be yielded without a struggle; because there is no
reasonable colour for demmding any thing. If more should be required, and the alternative must be immediately war, you may go as
far as Ten thousand dollars; if [that] does not satisfy, you must refer
the matter to your Government. I n the mean time and until we
know that the terms of the Treaty are finally settIed, agreeably to
those instructions, no part of the stores can be forwarded. Instead of
them the United States w-ill send a naval force into the Mediterranean
for the protection [of] their commerce. If instead of the regalia, or
present of naval and military stores stipulated to be delirered a t
Tunis, and which will be so extremely burthensome and diflicult to
accomplish, a cruizer not exceeding twenty two guns, six pounders
would be accepted, you may w e that such a c m e r shall be delivered, either one to be built for the purpose, or one already belonging
to the United States. But take care to obtain time enough for the fdb e n t of such a stipulation. All circumstances considered eighteen

Y

272

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1786 TO 1801

months should be allowed, if the Cruizer should be built, and half that
time if one already built should be found suitable for the seroioe of
the Bey. But there will be no unnecessary delay.
If after entering on the new negotiation, you find you cannot secure
the continunnce of peace, you must keep the negotiation pending as
long as possible and dispatch letters to algiers to the Consul General
O'Brien, if he is not present at Tunis, and to our Consuls in all the
ports of the hfideterranean Sea, and to our Ministers in Spain &
Portugal, stating that our war with Tunis is inevitable, or highly
probable; in order that American vessels may avoid entering that Sea,
until effectual measures shall be taken for their security. It will be
particularly important to send such letters to our Consul at Gibraltar, where so many American Vessels touch before they enter the
Mediterranean.

To William Eaton, U. S. Consul, Tunis, from Secretary of State

[PHILADELPHIA]
Department of Stale, December 60. 1798.
SIR,I n addition to the instructions for farther negotiations with
Tunis, some explanations may be useful; as well RS general observations on the conduct proper to be pursued by you in the exercise of the
office of Consul.
To account for the extraordinary stipulation in the 14" article of
the treaty, it is to be noted, That the negotiator, Mr Farnin, is a
French merchant residing at Tunis, and much in favor with one or
more of the influential officers of that government. Mr Barlow
asserts that neither t h s stipulation nor that of the eleventh article
nor the one the Iast paragraph in the twelfth was comprehended in the
k t project of the treaty transmitted to him by M? Famin in A ~ r i l
1798: and he can account for the insertion of the fourteenth article
only on the ground that hfr Famin, being a merchant, might expect to
derive great commercial advantages from the direct trade he might
carry on to the United States.
In order to favour his projects or perhaps entirely ignorant of the
consequenccs of the article, the Bey and his chef officers agreed to it.
I t is possible, however, that there might be a further view: The Bey
and his Chief either aware of the effects of the article, or informed by
M? Famin, might contrive this article as the instrument of obtaining
a new sacrifice to their avarice; expecting it would not be agreed to by
the United States; and that in order to get it e unged! an additional
sum of money would be offered. I t is farther to e cons~deredthat the
hostile measures and designs of France a ainst the United States were
well known to Mr Farnin before the conc usion of the treaty; and that
as M?Herculais the principal French A ent in Barbary who recommend
Mr Famin to M' Barlow, as well as a the other agents of that nation
a t Algiers, Tunis or Tripoli, wore thwarting the interest^ of the United
States, so M' Famin might be willing to join his countrymen, with the
like national view. R e and M: Wercdais, nevertheless, reproach each
other and perhaps very justly. The result of this ne otiation demonstrates that neither deserves the confidence of the f Jnited States.

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS

It is to be remembered that as the policy of the Barbary Powers
constantly leads them to make war on some of the christian nations,
so the agents of these nations respectively endeavour to ward of[f] the
mischief; and thus are, in some sort, in a state of hostility among themselves. Whenever therefore the interests of the United States are in
question, you must chiefl rely on your own means to secure them.
Among the foreign Cons , however, there may be some whom your
experience of their candour may authorize you to confide in; and by a
friendly intercourse and mutual assistance the common interests of
the several nations you and they represent may be advanced. While
with such you will cultivate an acquaintance, you will endeavour to
live on terms of civility and good neighbourhood with all. * * *

DEPARTMENT
OF STATE,
Philadelphia Decr d0.1?'98.
SIR,Your intimate acquaintance with Barbary affairs and with the
means of preserving eace with the Regencies of the Country, renders
it unnecessa to m tiply instructions. There are some pomts, however, on whic you have asked direction, and on which I will state the
President's opinion.
All the stores stipulated for Tripoli not admitting a transportation
thirther a t this time, you can only take from Algiers such of the articles
as are now on board the Ship Hero Capt. Robinson destined for that
ort, but which makeno part of thestipulated storesstill due to Algiers.
gou will even take them in larger quantities than those st.pulated, if
on enquiry a t Algiers you should be of opinion, that they will be
accepted a t Tripoli in lieu of others not forwarded.
A small consular present may be made to the Bey of Tripoli: the
articles and their quality to be determined by you and Captain O'Brien,
and taken with you from Algiers

I t is to be recollected, that the twelve thousand dollars to be paid
to the Bey of Tripoli, on the arrival of the American Consul, were to
be in full of all demands, the naval stores to be delivered a t the same
time excepted. In making up an additional Consular present, therefore, you must study to make it as little e ense as possible.
You know it was proposed to lade x e naval stores for Tripoli,
including the planks &c on board a ship selected for the purpose just
before the spreading of the yellow fever, which has so retarded and
deranged business, as to render it impra[c]ticable to embark those
articles till the ensuing sprin when they w3.I be forwarded.
Shoud the Bey of Tripoli fisix-e an armed vessel to be built for him
in the United States, even if he proposes to pay for her, you will as
much as possible discharge the request, and if you cannot evade it,
you may ropose to report it to your Government: But if you find our
peace d b e endangered without your agreeing to furnish an armed
vessel of ten or twelve pns, ou may give your consent; but stipulate
for time enough to dehver t e vesssl a t Tripoli; and considering the
great distance and numerous accidents to cause delays, eighteen
months may be not too much.

I

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1785 TO 1801

You know the opposing interests of the European nations in regard
to the Barbary states, and thence how little the sincere aid of their
Consuls is to be relied on: et you know that we experienced the
friendship of the Swedes a t giers, and the Spanis[h] Consul, Gerardo
Joseph de Souza a t Tripoli, has manifested by his acts such good will to
the United States as to merit the warmest acknowledgements from the
Government. He was very useful to Captain O'Brien in forming the
Treaty; and to Captain Ingraham he has been a father as well as friend.
The letter addressed to him you will be careful to deliver, with such
expressions of respect and gratitude as his friendly conduct merits.
Among the three regencies eastward of Morocco, the United States
have considered Algiers as the most important; and in consequence
have there established a Consul General; the Government intending
that the Consuls a t Tripoli and Tunis should regularly correspond
with him, state all difficulties and demands which occur, and on
all material points request his opinion and advices. This is not
an arrangement of the moment, but intended for a permanent
system: no personal considerations will therefore contravene it.
There will still be a wide field for the exercise of the talents of the
Consuls; and on the questions they suggest for the consideration and
advice of the Consul General a t Algiers, they may mark out a line of
conduct to be pursued and exhibit their reasons for preferring it to any
other: these i t must be presumed will have their just weight with the
Consul General, and the Consuls will receive the credit due to them
from the Government of the United States. For besides corresponding
with the Consul General, the Consuls of Tripoli and Tunis will maintain a constant communication with the Department of State. If no
special occurrence requires a letter: yet let it be a standing rule to
write once a month if it be only to say that all's well.

In the present state of things it seems desirable that American

vessels should avoid the Barbary ports: for either by the peremptory
powers, or tempted by offers of good freights, they may take on board
the persons or goods of their subjects, when if inevitable misfortunes
and losses ensue, the United States will be required to make indemnities - and a t exorbitant valuations. Such was the case of the Ship
Fortune, belonging to the Bacris a t Algiers. After having been ut
under the American flag to carry our captives from Algiers to J a r seilles, she was afterwards kept or placed anew under that flag for the
purposes of the Bacris alone; and when laden on their account, and
captured and condemned by the British, the Bacris demanded and
compelled M' Barlow to give his obligation to pay them 40,987 Dollars.

*

The office of Consul of the United States for one of the States of
Barbary is a trust of high importance. On your good conduct may
depend the peace of your country and the consequent extensive interests of your merchants. These will r e q w e your vigilant attention.
The abuses of which a Barbary Consulate is capable, renders the trust
reposed in our integrity and fidelity the more honorable. The
President reies on your acquitting yourself in a manner to prove that
this confidence was well deserved.

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS

275

To James Leander Cothcart, U. 8. Consul, Tripoli, from Secretary of State

DEPARTMENT
OF STATE,
Philadelphia, Dec: 2Ot! 1798.
SIR,YOUwere so obliging as to propose several questions relative
to Barbary affairs. Without repeating them, I will answer them in
their order.
1. I t will neither be "necessary" nor expedient to solicit the Dey of
Algiers to use his influence with the Bey of Tunis, either to procure
a reception of Captain Eaton, notwithstanding any opposition by
Mr Famin, or to effect the requisite alteration of the Treaty he
negotiated in agrist 1797, with the Bey. The interposition of the late
Dey, Hassan Bashaw, served only to kindle the resentment of the
Bey of Tunis, $ to embarrass the negotiation & aggravate the terms
of the Treaty.
2. For answers to these I refer to the instructions addressed jointly
3) to C a n t Richard OIBrien, C a p t Eaton, t% yourself 118 December
4.
17981.
5. The Senate having, in their examination of the treaty arranged by
Mr Famin with Tunis, explicitly objected only to the fourteenth
article, and advised a new negotiation only on the account, i t would
not be expedient to form a new treaty, wh~chalso would probably be
more dficult than to procure an alteration in one or a few articles:
You will see, too, by the instructions before mentioned, that altho'
you are to endeavour to get altered the eleventh & twelfth articles of
the treaty, the alterations in the fourteenth are alone to be insisted
on. Besides, excepting these three articles, the treaty is well enough
6. My letter to Mr Famin (of which capt. Eaton will have a copy) and
the arguments which you and your colleagues are to use, according to
your instructions, together with the compensation for services whch
you are authorized to make him, it is expected will remove his o b j e ~ tions, & prevent his injuring our affairs: a t aU events, however, be is
not to be appointed our Consul. If in opposition to all these means
and arguments he should persist to demand the Consulate,he would
thereby demonstrate that he was unworthy of the trust.
7. It is the obvious interest of the United States to receive the good
offices of the Consuls of any nation who s h d manifest a sincere
disposition to serve us: and a t the present time, I believe no nation
whatever is better disposed to befriend us and to cultivate our good
will, than the British: and this spirit d l of course actuate their
Consuls & ministers. Their aid is not only to be accepted, but
requested, is found necessary: and the interposition of no other
national agents can be equally effected; for certainly the unpnrelleled
victory of Admiral Nelson, on the African coast, must be well h o w
in all the Barbary Regencies, whence must arrive the most elevated
ideas of their power; and to be the known friend of such a power, and
to receive its assistance t h o ' its public agents, cannot fail of promoting
our interests, if i t should not insure to us success. - As to the French,
whether we have an open and declared war with them or not, we are
to expect no aid from their Consuls. M! Barlow states, that from
first to last, the have been our determined enemies in Barbary.
Even his friend erculais, who recommended Mr Famin to negotiate
for us a t Tunis, has since avowed it to be the interest of France and
the duty of its agents, to oppose the interests of the United States

II

276

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1786 TO 1801

among the Barbary Powers. Herculais has also accused Mr Famin
as unfit to be trusted with our negotiation, and Farnin in his turn
accuses and reproaches Herculais: on both sides the reproaches may
be well founded.

I refer you to your separate instructions.
11
10. This is a subject for the consideration of the government, not

necessary now to be decided.

As you have a crew competent to the defence of the Schooner

The Brig Haman Bashuw and the Brigantine Sophia, also the
property of the United States, and armed for defence, are to sail

You are to use all your endeavours to keep
company together, and for your mutual protection and defence.
These orders for using arms, you will observe point only to defence:
you are therefore not to give chase to or attempt to take any vessel
you may meet with. Nevertheless, Should you a t sea fall in with any
American vessels in the hands of French captors, you may retake
them. And you will understand that it is against the French Cruisers
that these orders for defence are mainly intended: the Government
of that nation having laid aside all regard to the law of Nations and
the most plain and acknowledged principles of justice, in the arrets
and regulations i t has made in regard to the capture and condemnation of neutral vessels, and especially those of the United States. I n
attempting a recapture of an American vessel, you will consider well
her Strength, and attempt nothing a t the risque of the Schooner
under your command, or of her consorts. You may also take under
your convoy any American vessel holding the same course and sailing
so well as not to retard your voyage. In case of making a recapture,
you are not materially to deviate from your proper course, nor essentially diminish the force of your crew. If ou chance to overtake the

to keep company with them. and enter the

although not desirous to molest us, yet if their Shi s should meet any

[SDA. CL,Algiers, Vol. 3, 1798.1
To Richard O'Brien, U. S. Coneul Qeneral, Algiers, from Secretaq of State

DEPARTMENT
OF STATE,
Philadelphia Decr d l . 1798.
SIR, After so long delay, the armed vessels destined for Algiers are
now departing. The schooner Lelah Eisha, Captain William Maley
commander, has indeed sailed, taking under her convo the ship
Hero, Captain Robinson, laden with timber and stores or Algiers.
The Hassan Bashaw, the Schooner Skjoldebrand, and the brigantine
Sophia, are now ready to sail, and it is expected will reach Algiers
as soon as the Lelah Ehha and the Hero.
I have received your letters of the 2 d , 6*P & 79' of March, with
sundry documents. From the state of our affairs a t Algiers and the
other two eastern regencies, it is unfortunate that the cash you took
with you was not lodged at Gibraltar: it is only to be lamented that
Barbaq proves such a devouring gulph. But no one demand appears
more provoking than that of the two Jews, Joseph Coen Bacn and
Niftal~Busna, for the estimated price of the Ship Fortune and Cargo,
being 40,987 dollars, undor pretence that she was an American bottom,
because a t their instance, or that of their partners a t Leghorn, American papers were given to her, to enable her to hoist the American
flag - for the interest not of the United States, but solely for the
Interest of the Jews. Had the Ship been really American, we could
not complsin of the demand for the value of her cargo, which, according to the usage in Barbary, that the flag shall be res onsible for the
cargo, we should not hesitate to pay. But after Mr I
!arlow'e efforts,
to parry this unreasonable claim, and after his giving bond for the
ayment, doubtless all further remonstrance d be fruitless. If,
b w e m r , Bacri a Busna will not relinquish or abate in this demand,
it is not too much to ask longer forbearance of payment. The cargo
of the So hia is intended to cancel a large part of their demand;
and this tfupment has exhausted the remainder of the vaat appmpri-

f

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS

281

ations for Barbary affairs. An estimate is now before Congress for
additional grants; and in the ensuing Spring further progress will be
made in fulfilling our Barba engagements. If however the three
armed vessels destined for the ey and Regency reach algiers in safety
we earnestly hope you will with them, be able to cancel our most
burthensome stipulations with Algiers. As to the large masts m
particular, i t [is] barely possible that we should ever furnish them;
and as they are too big for any Algerine cruizers, others might be
substituted, if masts cannot wholl be dispensed with. So extremely
expensive have been and must <e the qttempts b procure them
that each mast, originally estimated a t Algiers to cost thirty dollars:
delivered there, will cost the United States from six to eight hundred.
Herewith you will receive invoices of the cargoes of the store ship
Hero, Captain Robinson, the brigantine Hassan Bashaw, Captain
Smith, the Schooner Skjoldebrand, Captain Penrose, and the schooner
Lehh Eisha, Captain Maley, all which cargoes are on account of our
stipulations with the Algerines, some articles excepted which were put
on board to fill up vacancies, and which i t was expected would pay
a freight to Algiers. Among these articles are some which may serve
for Tripoli, of which you and Captain Cathcart will make such a
selection as you shall think will be most acceptable, either directly in
discharge of the stipulations with that power, or as substitutes for
others still behind. I also inclose you the invoice of the cargo of the
United States brigantine Sophia, Captain Henry Geddes, containing
parts of the oods which Bacri & Busnah desired to have shipped on
account of %f r Clarke's bill in their favor for the 40,987 dollars which
Mr Barlow e aged to pay them for the Ship Fortune and Cargo.
You mentione in your letter of March 6 tQ that these goods must be
shipped on the account and risk of the United States: this has been
done: I consider them as the property of the United States: and conseht to charge Bacri & Busna with their
quently you will have a
amount a t the current who esale prices of the like goods a t Algiers.
They cannot make any reasonable objection to this. But before the
delivery of the articles to them you may select such small portions of
each as you and captains Eaton & Cathcart shall think important to
apply in presents a t Tunis & Tripoli.
The Schooner Maria, converted into a brig by Captain Graves,
returned to Boston, where when sold with some trifling cargo, she
scarcely defrayed the wages of the crew: The loss sustained in this
case having arisen from the fraud or folly of the American master we
must be content to bear.
Mr Donaldson's protested bill, now in the hands of the Bacris, for
Â£473.14. - Sterling must rest a little while, until the accounts of Mr
Donaldson, who has lately returned to the United States, can be
examined.
ect will be accomplished in a few weeks, when
I will immediately
This Iad ess you on the subject.
On the first of November last I received a letter from Mr George
Clarke, with his account of monies received and expended a t Algiers
while officiating as the Agent of the United States, under Mr Barlow's
appointment. A copy of that account I now enclose for your examination; and I beg you to report to me your oplnion upon its.varioua
items. Besides an a arent of economy m general, some arbcles are
extremely exceptiona e and others inadmissible. For these reasons,
I shall decline accepting his bill, whenever it arrives, for the balance

%

?

"P

\!'

282

NAP*& OPERATIONS FROM 1785 TO 1801

he has stated to be due to bim. This balance is not equal to the sums
which are evidently inadmissible in his account. My letter to him
stating my principal objections, is inclosed for your information.
I inclose the instructions directed by the President of the United
States to be given to you and to Captains Eaton & Cathcart, relative
to a new negotiation with Tunis. Those instructions are so full, I
need only refer you to them for your information of the President's
mind on the subjects to be discussed. If without any disadvantage
to our affairs in Algiers, you can go with the other two Consuls to
Tunis, the President will be well pleased in your doing it. Otherwise
you will consent and agree with them on the mode of proceeding
which shall appear most proper to insure success - T d
lmake only
one remark, that after considering yours and Mr Barlow's communications on Tunissian affairs, it appears very evidently, that the interference of the Dey of Algiers, to force a peace for the United States
with Tunis, did us much harm: it irritated the Bey, and aggravated
his demands.
I n the event of a successful negotiation with Tunis, a Consular
present may be necessary. So also may one be expedient for Tripoli.
You will advise with captain Eaton and Captain Cathcart on the
articles to compose these presents, and reduce them to as low a scde
as possible.
For the convenience of the Consuls at Tunis and Tripoli, in receiving
their salaries, and in emergences to prevent any injury to the United
States by delay, it will be expedient to establish a credit a t each of
those places, with some substantial House on which the Consuls may
draw. This matter you will well consider, and arrange with them in
such limits as shall appear to be best for the interest of the United
States.
The extraordinary emergences requiring instant disbursements of
money, the Consuls a t Tunis and Tripoli are as expeditiously as
possible to report to you: on all other occasions of consequence, they
are previously to request your advice and opinion. Those Consuls,
in their instructions, are mformed, that among the three regencies
eastward of Morocco, the Government has considered Algiers as the
most important; and in consequence have there established a Consul
General; it being intended that the Consuls at Tunis and Tripoli
should regularly correspond with him, state all diÂ£Eiculties and demands which occur, and on all material points request his opinion and
advice ; and this is not an arrangement for the moment, but intended
as s permanent sys tern.
By a letter from Mr Ingraham, our temporary Agent at Tripoli,
communicated by Mr Barlow, i t appears that he had provided and
fitted up a House for the residence of our Consul. I t seems proper
that the like provision should be made at Tunis, in case the peace
should be confirmed.
The United States brigantine Sophia accompanies the other armed
vessels to Algiers, for two purposes: to transport the articles intended
to cancel a part of M Barlow's bond to Bacri & Busnah; and bring

But it may ha pen that crews may be conveniently sent home in

be necessary to employ the Sophia in a vo a e to Tunis and Tnpofi,

them. The Government is engaged to bring home those crews; i t is
important to secure the return of so many seamen; and the continuance of their wages until they are sent home, is an object not to be
overlooked. Let all circumstances be weighed, and the best interests
of the United States govern the decision. But at all events the c r e w
are to be provided with passages to the United States, and without
unreasonable delay.

DEPARTMENT
OF STATE
PHILADELPHIA
Decr dl. 1798
SIR, The United States armed Brigantine Sophia, under your command being laden on their account and destined for Algiers, you will
proceed thther and deliver your cargo to Richard O'Brien Esquire
the Consul General of the United States a t that place.
The armed Brigantine Hassan Bashaw and armed Schooner
Skjoldebrand being to sail a t the same time, you will endeavour to
keep company with them; and if you meet w t h any armed vessel,
and she attacks or attempts to capture either of your vessels, you
are to defend yourselves to the utmost of your power. Such attacks
or attempts you may expect only from the French cruisers, or cruisers
equipped in Spain under the influence or countenance of the French.
From British Cruisers you will apprehend no annoyance; on the
contrary, from them you may expect every friendly assistance, when
the shall know the character and destination of the Sophia.
!&he Brigantine Sophia is to be considered as the Commodore of
this little armament. The signals to be observed a t sea have doubtless been concerted between the Hassan Bashaw Captain Smith,
Ca tain Penrose of the Skjoldebrand, and yourself; and also with the
Eisha, Captain Mnley and Captain Robinson of the Ship Hero,
should you come up with them on our passage t.o Algiers.
In case of Separation, you will ma e the best of your way toAlgiers.
Should i t be perfectly convenient, you may touch a t Gibraltar, where
John Gavino, the American Consul will advise you of any dangers
respecting the further rosecution of your voyage, and especially if
any circumstances shou d forbid your proceeding thither, without information from Captain O'Brion: and in the mean time Mr Gavino
will have the goodness to write to our ministers at Madrid and Lisbon,
and ask their advise on the State of things. If you should fall in on the coast of Morocco, and i t should be convenient to touch a t Tangier, yon may do it: You will there find
James Simpson Esqr the American Consul for Morocco, who will
ive you any necessary advise and assistance. - But there is so
ettle -0,
t~ apprehend my d a c u l t y in going to Algiers, if on
your arrival a t the Streights the wind proves fair, i t will be best to
take advantage of it, to push thro' and roceed directly to Algiers.
The greatest danger to be apprehended rom hostile cruisers is conceived to be near the entrance of the Mediterranean Sea, as those
cruisers frequent the Spanish ports of Algesiras on one side, and
Ceuta on the other.

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1785 TO 1801

The primary objects of sending the Sophia to Algiers are, to carry
her present cargo thither, and then to bring home the crews of the
Hassan Ba-zhaw, the Skjoldebrand, and U a h Ei~ha,
which three vessels are to be delivered and left a t that city. It may happen however,
that American vessels may be returning from Alpers to the United
States, in which the crews of those three armed vessels may be conveniently embarked; and that it may be important for you to proceed in the Sophia with the Consuls Eaton and Cathcart, to Tunis
and Tripoli. On this oint, the Consul General a t Algiers, Capt.
O'Brien, and the Consu s Eaton and Cathcart will consult, and determine as the best interests of the United States shall appear to require;
bearing in mind that the crews of the three Armed vessels must be
provided with passages to America; it has been promised to them;
and it is important that the promise should be performed, as well to
secure the future services of such a number of mariners, as in point
of economy, because !heir wages will go on until their return; unless
they ooluntarily come lnto some new agreement at Algiers.
If it should be determined that the Sophia should proceed to Tunis
eeable to you to continue in the
and Tripoli, I hope it will be
command of her: but if it sho d be inconvenient and you prefer
returning immediately to the United States, the Sophia may be transferred to the Command of one of the American Captains now going
to Algiers, whom Captain O'Brien shall select for that purpose.

As the Sophia is to accompany the Hmsan B a s h and Skjoldebrand, and has the consuls on board; as Captain Geddes also is an old

may receive our earliest attention - a communication to the Department of tate of the most correct information attainable, of the
naval force of Tripoli, the species of armed vessels, the number of

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1785 TO 1801

War, the times in the year when those armed vessels usually put to
sea; their common cruizing ground, and their modes of attack. I t
will likewise be very desirable to obtain the most accurate information
of the several ports of Tripoli, the quality of their roads and the bars
as to the depth of water and exposure to winds, and the manner of
entering them with safety. As soon also as you can get correct information of their form of government; their military force, how many
regular troops, and their state of discipline, and their numbers and
condition of the militia, you will communicate the same.
If there be some months in the year when the navigation on the
Barbary coast is more dangerous than in others, you will note them
accordingly; and general course of the winds, and their violence and
moderation a t the different seasons.
In the estimate of the stores stipulated for Tunis, of which a copy
was given to Capt-aton,
instead of twelve hundred read twelve
thousand cannon ball: - They are supposed to weigh 60 tons which is
right.
As the cypher in words will be found less embarrassing than the one
in letters with a key word, it will in general be best to use the former,
as will between the three Consuls a t Algiers, Tunis and Tripoli, and
William Smith Esq: our Minister a t Lisbon as with the department
of State. But if there should be any thing to communicate among the
Consuls or to the department of State requiring impenetrable secrecy,
then use the letter cy her with the key agreed on.
Great care must e taken in writing in cyphers, to avoid errors,
which might have injurious consequences.

unshiped that he might have the protection of an American, that he
can leave Tunis free, and let him proceed to the U. S. or france and
there Settle his accounts, which Should be well looked into.
"Allmy endeavours is to try to adopt plans of Occonomie, and to
Save extra demands on the United States, and as god is My Judge,
there is left no Stone unturned on my part on this task but Sir we
want Energie, make good our Stipulations with Algiers Tunis and
Tripolia. our peace with those States has Cost us large Sums of
Money, and by the robberies of the Contending nations, we Cannot
have our Colours free. So that we might derive Some profits if we
had our Colours free in the Meditteranian, be assured we Should have
a Cleare gain annually of 1% Millions of dollars, and if war and we had

On the 234 Jan? a t Meridian arrived in Algiers the United States Schooner the

sailed in company with the Ship Hero Captain Robertson, loaded by the United
States with stores for Algiers. That the 34 ni ht after we (they1 were a t Sea, the
Ship Hero separated in a severe gale of wind from Ca tain Maley's account of
uud Ship, I have my fears, that she haa foundered a t &a, or so distrraaed that
she haa put into port, or fallen into the hands of the French On the arrival of this vessel, destined for this governmc I acquainted the general
of the Marine & minister for foreign affairs that the Corsairs built in the United
States, on account of Algiers, that the other two I expected woud arrive in a few
days, the General assured me hc was well pleased, that he was always my friend,
but that I well knew Algiers, & the nature of its Governmt Yes thinks I, the
Dey's will in a great measure governs all affairs. On the 24'b commenced discharging the Leloh Eisha on this occasion the
French Consul, & the whole of the french legation, were employed, they were 18
in number, employed aa captives The General of Marine desired of me to be informed when I would deliver up to
the re ncy the Schooner, I answd that when she was discharged of the stores, &
when rwoud be assured by him, that it woud be on the terms for which said vessel,
with the other two was built - We then discussed the business. I informing him
of Hamen Bashaws request to me OBrien & Mr Barlow tlmt these vessels shoud
be built & equipt a t the particular request of the Government of Algiers & that
when they arrived from the U: States a t Algiers they shoud be paid for, I added
that the late Dey desired them in lieu of annuity, their am: to be deducted from our
annual payments I shewed the General of Marine Hassen Bashaw's order relative to these corsairs
& under the seal of the regency & he & I agreed, that by shewing i t to the Dey, it
woud only kindle his rage, & we agreed to adopt other plans that looked likely to
ensure tranquility NOTE- The present Dey Babba Mustapha was prime minister to the late Dey
& notwithstanding he cannot bear his name mentioned, or any thing relative to
him, but what it kindles his anger, it will be obsefved the present Dey, originally
was a common Soldier but promoted by the influence of the late Dey Hassen
Bashaw On the morning of the 26 Jan? the Dey sent for the American Dragoman, &
desired him to acquaint me that the American corsair^ in port with the two expected ones, he woud only accept of as free g i f t s from the U: 8:as tokens of the
Americans friendship to the Dey & regency. - I answered that the Consul for the
U: S: always did aasure the Dey & regency of the friendship of the U: 8: that we
had it not in our power to give such extraordinary tokens of friendship as the Dey
requested he well knowing these Corsairs were sent here a t the particular request
of the Algerine government to be paid for & accounted for out of the annuity
The Dey anewered if I coud not give them to him gatis, that he coud not admit
them to be rec4 as deducting from our annual Stipulations, & that I of course knew
best what was for the interests of my Country -

I answered that I coud not give them gratis, that I had no orders, & never need
expect any on this business, in giving these vessels as free gifts, that the honor of
Algiers was a t stake, on this affair which I received in a very delicate light. - That
the present Dey waa announced to the world aa one of the most righteous Kinga that the 3 Coraairs woud be in his power but that the world woud judge on the
circumetance, This was after prayers on Frida which is Turks Sunday The Dey declared by his faith & honor arr a &u88elman, that the Consul of the
U. S. had arrived to trick him relative to obliging the regenc to take the corsairs
for payments in Money or to be accounted for in lieu of the gtipulations annually
That we had promised those Corsaim to the late Dey when the agent of the U. 8.
seen the necessity of securing the American peace & for the friendship of the Dey
relative to the other Barbary states, That he was present with the late Dey when
the agent of the U. S. made this promise, & that if I woud not acquiesae & give
them to him we might try a long time & make another peace - This was communicated to me secretly from a real friend On the evening of the 25* the Dey sent his own Dragoman to me with this
interrogation, did not the U. S. ive the Frigate to Hassen Bashaw as a free
from the Governm* of the U. S. under this consideration is not the present
to be as much noticed, respected & honor'd as the late Dey who had such large
Sums of Money from the U. S., & intimating that he had renewed the peace & kept
it, & only recd a few trifling presents
I answered that the U. S. gave the frigate to the Dey & regency as a stipulation
for the peace, that the Hamdullah was a commission business, & was paid for,
that the money we gave for the peace & the frigate with every thing else, was a t
present in the power of the present Dey, he being by the almighty will a t the head
of this Governmt - which OBrien must observe is an iron bound republic That I did not want to take any money from the public treasury. that the
United States were in arrears in their annual stipulations, & that i t woud be found
in viewing the business in its true light by balancing one circumstance against the
other, that finally these 3 comirs woud be found under the discussion or arrangement, as gratis, I have carried no funds from Algiers to have these vessels built,
& that we on this point entirely depended on the honor of the Dey & Ministry of
this regency Next the Dey sent for me & asked me if it was known in the U. S. that Hassen
Bashaw was mort, & thab he was on the throne, & If I had any letter for him
from the Governm; of the U. S., I observed on his coming to the throne I announced the happy circumstance to the Governm* of the U. S. by several conveyances that I built on his friendship, that in consequence the U. S. had full
confidence in what I assured them on his part, & observed from the favorable
reception he gave me on his coming to the throne, that it made the most favorable
impression on me, that the Govt of the U. S. in sending these corsairs fully demonstrated the confidence they had in the Dey & minktry of Algiers, & that we
were of the opinion of the Algerines, that friendship did not consist in words but
in deeds, to be judged of by many other circumstances, & that I hoped by the Deye
seriously viewing this business in its true light, i t woud have the consideration
that was necessary from a great & wiye prince - on this he said he woud consider The schooner Lelah Eisha had her American colors, aft & Jack forward, & 8s a
usual compliment to the City, the Algerine flag a t the main - The Dey sent to
me & the same time to the Gent of Marine, & desired that the red flag, woud be
hawled down as I woud not give him these vessels as a free gift On this I went to the Marine & ordered the flag to be hawled down, & the same
time ordered Capt. Maley to hoist his American pendant & fire a gun - after this
all Algiers declared that the Dey intended to make war with the Americans This occasioned my letters to Consuls Appleton & Montgomery, dated the 26*
Jan7 1799 On the arrival of the Lelah Eisha, or any vessel it is customary to enquire what
news The Dey sent to me, I answered, that said vessel was attacked off Tariffa by
French & Spanish Gun boats, that the Gut was swarming with sea pirates, that
the whole sea pork of the U: S. was during the summer visited by the plague,
that we were making great preparations against the French That the King of En land had requested of the U. S. to make a n alliance for
100 years, that it took t%e U. S. 8 days to consider on the answer to be returned,
& that the U. S. answered, they woud take one yerrr to consider of it - & to return
a definitive answer to this important business -

rest a whiie untill the arrival of the other two corsairs I told the general 1 wes
fully convinced of his & the prime Ministers intercession relative to the american
affairs - That he well knew I was the Agent of the U: S: not sent here to lavish
away, their interests, & sacrifice my own character which I held in as high estimation 8s my life - That if the Dey insisted on those vessels fo be given gratis,
that I woud never acquiesce in it - that if they were to be detained by force
this was a different sffair - that the U. S. woud sooner lose the Ship in ballast,
than with a valuable cargo, he desired I woud explain I observed that the U. 8. never did any injury to the Algerines or the other
Barbwy States, that we gave a great sum for the peace & ransom that we gave
the Frigate & consulary presents that we had brot to Algiers 8 cargo's & 5 corsairs,
that those 3 corsairs were valuable that we R-antedthem much ourselves, that me
were preparing for defence, that we had 40 Sail of corsairs a t sea, that many more
were building that notwithstanding we were faithful to our engagements, & that
we woud aooner lose our peace a t this time - than a t some other period that the
Medettiranean has been a burying ground for our commerce, that I coud assure
him that the Americans were a brave people, that I shoud be sorry, the result
of our affairs woud be war, but that he well knew the govt of Algiers woud be in
the fault That the fact was that we did not want the peace if we coud fully rely
on this governmj in strictly observing the treaty we made, that the peace coud be
no object under any other consideration
This was my explanation to lose the Ship in ballast not with a cargo when the
U. S. woud have 2, or 300 mercht vessels in the Medettiranesn after this the
general observed I had much reason in my argument & that he hoped we would
pescably settle At this time o w affairs remained something quiet, & be convinced I was fully
occupied, tacking & sounding all parties & Classes Our best friend of the Jew party is Micish Bacri h e unfortunately during these
squalls & since is every unwell, & on the exit of the late Dey, Miciahs influence
declined whilst Kapthali Busnah one of the parties of the House, sprung up with
the present Dey, & said Busnach is as much in the favor of the present Dey, af~
Miciah was of the late Dey - So that I had on hard terms to purchase the influence of Kapthali Busnah, & in fact they or no one else, will do any service except
they are well rewarded for it, it is my Dear Sir the nature of this extraordinary
government On monday the 4* Few, a t Meridian arrived the U. S. Schooner the Skalderbrand in 29 Days from the Delaware. The wind was fresh I went on hoard, &
crouded said vessel in a croud of Sail. They Dey and ministry were well pleased
a t her fast Sailing Cspt: Penrose informed me that he parted Company with Capt. Smith of the
Hassen Bashaw on the O'P & also that he parted with the Sophia - that the
weather was very Severe, Capt : Penrose was fired a t off TarBa by the French &
Spanish Gun boats, & eeen an American Ship taken by them The Minister of the Marine informed me that i t was the Deys request to know
what each of the Schooners had cost, I answered that they esiled in a hurry, &
that the documents on this business woud come with the Brig or with the expected
Consuls
He next desired to be informed, what was the am+of all 3 with the
Store ship expected, I said I coud not well guess, that on the arrival of the other
v
d he shoud be particuIarly informed On the 8 9 e b T arrived in Algiers the U: S: Brig the Hassen h h a w Capt:
John Smith in 32 days from Philad*, this brig is the most beautiful & most compleat vessel ever seen by OBrien It being Turks Sunday & on this v d 8 coming in Bight, & arrivin oE the
City under sail, OBrien on board, fired a full salute. - The whole 8ity was
viewing said vessel, & finally the concourse of people, that wes asembled on this
occasion, were more than I ever Been on the arrival of any veasel in this Country 99 This morning the Dey desired I woud acquaint him what waa the separate
price of each of these corsairs, I said that this accf wsa not sent by any of them,
se the rivers, were closing with ice, & that the Sophia with the Consul8 woud
bring the whole dispatches I shall observe that it was very prejudicid t o the interests of the U. 8. a t this
crisis of the buainese, that the separate price of each of these vessels, wae not
horn, the ricea shoud be forwarded by each veseel & if an accident happened

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS
The whole maratime class of the Algerines were captivated with those vessels
& observed generally that after they had traversed the boisterous ocean they
had arrived in Algiers, without carrying away a rope yarn, these three corsairs
arrived in perfect order & from their maneuvering in sight of all Algiers, the
regularity & that all essential maratime order, amazed the Algerines, & from this
snmple of American construction, Officers & Men, comprising the Crews of these
vessels, the Algerines are convinced that we have abilities & resources in the
United States to be a very active & stubborn enemy in case war was to be the
result or reward of all our endeavors to cultivate peace This evening the Dey sent hi^ purveyor or Jew Broker Napthali Busnach to
inquire secretly of me what the 3 Corsairs cost, it was vexatious & incredible to
the Dey to be informed that I coud not give him the requisite information on this
business, & the Dey seemed determined in having the Brig Hassen Bashaw to
himself, & woud not renounce the idea of, but what the U. S. gave the Frigate
to the late Dey, & that he woud have the Brig or finally he woud not be content,
& if we had a peace it woud be on a sandy foundation - & without doubt the
Dey being displeased his marine officers woud see under what pretence, they
woud send in American vessels in order to try to make a plea or pretence for
condemning them - & the Dey not being sstisfyed, woud be of the condemning
party - however under these & many other important considerations, I had to
consider what plan I had to adopt to content the Dey & Ministry Gain their friendship in order to give strength & security to our affairs, &
from fully viewing our affairs relative to Algiers, Tunis & Tripoli, many of our
Merchant Vessels in the Medettiranean, I found there would be a necessity to
sscrafice one of them vessels, which was the Brig for the Obdurate Dey - The
same time to see the necessity to see on what terms I shoud manage the other
important affairs, indeed a t this period of the business, I shoud have been happy
to have had the advice of the U. S. Governm*, how in the name of God I shoud
act & timid, fearing that I coud not well see my way in piloting our affairs, out
from amongst the shoals, & alarmed that I might, if once, acquiesce in giving the
Brig, that by the same rule I woud give the 2 schooners, no, one person Knew, or
had hardly any idea of what was my opinion on these affairs I t had been ur ed by the ministry a t least by a part of them in the run of this
businem, that as! had no orders to give the Dey these Corsairs, to write & bring
the Dey an answer, but during the time woud not this governm* use these corsairs
as their own & if the answer from the U. S. was no woud not this governm* keep
them, so well knowing the consequence - I prayed to the Almighty to direct
me for the best
On Saturday the Qt? FebT a t 1 P M arrived the U. S. Brig Sophia, Commodore
Geddis in 33 days from the Delaware having on board Consuls Eaton & Cathcart, I r e d the dispatches of the Secv of State, & escorted the eastern Bashaws on
Shore, introduced them to the minister of the Marine, & proceeded up to the
old & dismal American house & attended strictly to my official duty
At 7 P M went to the Minister of Marine's house & presented to him the
following prices of the 3 corsairs, my mind had got a start from reading the
presidents measage to congress of June the 21* 1798 it certainly had that effect
on me, that I raised my voice & considered myself as the representative of a
great, free, powerful, & independent nation, & I viewed the U. S. a t war with
Algiers & then a t peace, & be convinced i t was not much of a balance from
either -

I observed that the U. S. also gave the Frigate [Crescent] to the Algerines that
said vessel cost the U. S. 150,000 Dollars, & that plainly there was no nation the
Algerines got so much by, as they did by the Americans, that Algiers might see the
necessity on that day she woud be a t war with Denmark, Sweden & Holland, that
she woud have no supplies from the Baltic, & that they had the U. S. for their
friends, observing the U. S. Government, had the greatest Confidence in the
Algerine Government & hoped on this occasion we shoud fully experience a
demonstration of their friendship & equity Finding my scheme likely to t.ake place, that the late Dey was no more, & no
evidence against me but the jews, I went to the Bacri's & Busnah's & by degrees
broc them into my views - The necessity was that I shoud in douseurs sacrifice
the whole of the Sophia's Cargo, between the Jews & the Ministry, & as a preliminary to this scheme promised the Jews the goods which were on board the
Sophia a t the first cost, this there was the greatest necessity of as Miciah Bacri
& Busnah knew the stipulation, & as they had a half promise on this business
during the painful detention of the Corsairs, for their influence in pacifying the
Dey, who almost got out of patience on account of their detention, & not to reduce
me to the necessity of more important Sacrifices - as this plan or scheme wau
fully established and determined on, on my part & that - I had the whole influence of the ministry I was determined a t all events to make no great sacrafice to
the Dey, who thought to scare me, but sir I must declare to you that my friend
was so far made up on this business, that even the result, shoud be war, it coud
not well be avoided sooner than indulge them in so great an imposition, particularly it being an affair from first to last in which I was so particularly interested,
& that I knew so much of in all its diffl channels & stages 16Q Feb? a courier arriving from Alicant with dispatches from William Smith
Es r our Minister a t Lisbon, the Dey immediately sent to me to know if I had
rec3 orders to give him the Corsairs gratis, I said that as I told him from first to
laqt, that I woud only on the t e r n for which they were originally stipulated for &
not giving the Dey time to reflect - I sent my Dragoman to the Dey & desired
that I would r uest to be immediately admitted to an audience this was in the
afternoon w h e a knew the Prime Minister & Minister of the Marine woud be in
company with the Dey 1 observed that we did not wish to draw any money from the trecrsury, that if
the Dey woud put the 2 Schooners a t 36.000 sequins he might have the Brig
gratis - as a present from the U. S. That the Portuguese ambassador in Philad* had offered for these 3 Corsairs
the sum of 120,000 Dollars if Delivered in Lisbon, that I knew this to be a fact,
that I was so much the friend of Algiers, that I coud assure the Dey it was the
policy of the Christian Nations to do every possibility to reduce the Marine of
Algiers, that the U. S. found a pleasure particularly a t present in encreasing the
strength of Algiers in order to crush the French, who had turned the robbers &
persecutors of the Musselmen & of the Neutral Nations NOTE. what are these 3 corsairs employed in, I say, in these Seas, to look out,
take, sink, burn & destroy, French Corsairs that is robbing & pirating Americans,
so that from this circumstance it will be the means of our commerce having lees
obstructio~lsin this quarter HARD GALES, OBRIEN, OFTEN BROUGHT UNDER BARE POLES

16'P FebT a t 3% P M Conference with the Dey continued, I observed, that the
Dey woud recollect that the Maratime & Military stores, stipulated for the Peace
was 60,000 Dollars, that we had on the 2 years & 3 years annuity, brot 10 Cargoes,
that the Brig he woud have to himself, provided that he woud allow me 3 years
annuity for the 2 schooners, the Dey & ministry suddenly observed i t was too
much, the Dey said I might either have allowed 30,000 Sequ~nsfor the 2 Schooners,
& under this consideration he woud have the Brig to himself - or that he never
woud be the friend of the Americans, I immediately finding I carried the oint of
8. to
the treatie Stipulation for, W.000 Doll* gave the Brig in t h t name of the
the Dey in the presence of all the Ministry. On this occasion they all congratulated the Dey - The Dey & Ministry obsrved that i t wa9 only this day that the
Americans made and secured their peace, that we might fully depend on the great
friendship of Algiers, that he really was never angry with me, but could not help
considerink;I had it in my power to let the 2 Schwncr. go at 30,000 Dollq. 1
observed t t even ss the business was settled, that I was afraid of my head with
the American Govenunt & hoped if requisite the Dey & Ministry would give me
a certificate, which woud in some respecta plead an excuse for me relative to my
Conduct, on this occasion, Aye Says the Dey, we shoud have a new consul here
one that did not so well know the place as you do -

On the 18Q delivered up to the regency the 3 Corsairs which gave to the whole
inhabitants great satisfaction, from the 3 Corsairs was first discharged their proviaiom on board of the Sophia & the Polacre called the Dey purchased by OBrien to
carry the crews of the Hassen Bashaw & Lelah Eisha to the U. S., said Polacre will
be commanded by Capt: Smith a very active Man - [See 10 January 17991
On the 21.r I went into the palace to setble the accounts & in calling over the list
of articles sent by the U. S. agreeable to the InvQ& bills of Lading sent by the
Purveyor 1found not more than 2/34. of the articles were taken notice of. The
receipts of the Secv in the Palace did not agree with those procured by Mr Clarke
from the Marine i t was certainly a great neglect or omission on his part, & there
was no alternative on mine but to settle the accounts, agreeable to the articles or
receipts for the car oes as they were in this Governm* books in the palace, under
this consideration
had no alternative but to make the best of i t as you a-ill
observe by the military & maratime store account current as settled by me with
this regency The Cargoes of the Independant, Jupiter & Newport, there was no Marine Turk
receipt, for Mr Clarke shamefully neglected, the duty he shoud attend to, & to
answer our affairs & his own made presents of part of these cargoes to the Dey &
ministry, for repairs they were making to their houses, in town and country, &
relative to the Ship Newporl Capt: Tew lying so long in Algiers without being discharged, I beleive it wss owing to a private understanding between Tew & Clarke,
such Sir has been their conduct Finding I had gained my object in settling the peace business a t 60,000 Doll* &
that the whole of the Stores sent, only turned out 66,000 Doll* I was determined
to obtain the Deys certificate, which he gave me under the seal of the regency,
certifying that I had on the part of the U. S. settled the whole of the peace business, & another certificate, that our annual Stipulations were paid for 2 years &
9 Mo9 Finding I had gained this point, I declared that our peace was in a great measure declared null or void by Hassen Bashaw, & that in consequence by a new
Settlement, by the Dey & Mr Bar!ow, that it was only reckoned from the time
Mr Barlow landed which was the 4th March 1796 This Argument I mentioned with all my force, & finally the Prime Minister
declared that I had much reasoning in the argument & that he would look more
into the business, 2 of the Secys shewed some seeming reluctance in acquiescing,
as I suppose from this circumstance thc[yl knew better, but one of the Busnah e
& Bacri's wss called in - and if I can gain this point, they must again be bribed
or paid, as is the usual way, they are to be compensated for the services they render

DEARSIR I take the liberty to inform you of the measures that
has been taken by the Bashnw of Tripoli with the different nations,
that he has made war & peace with during my residence in that reagency. Likewise. relative to the mode of Conducting the affairs of
the united States with the different States of Barbary.
first its necessary that our Peace should be held separately with each
reagency, and the consul resident there, and not depend on one reagency to hold our peace with the others. Seccondly, that the g o d of the
united Stats should keep two good frigats in the mediterranean, and
one constantly on a Cruise to Convoy and protect our Shiping, from
the many insults they are daly & ourly exposed to, and visit the
differant Ports of Barbary every 2 or three months a t least, to keep
these reagencys under some subjection which cannot be dun otherways, and a small arm'd vessel to be Constant going & returning,
with dispatches, too and from the united States to the Commander of
these frigats, he likewise ought to have power given him to make
up any Breach of friendship that may happen between our Consul
resident in either of these reagencys which ~snot in the power of a
Consul to do, and even to Sacrifise 20 or 30000 dollars sooner than
risk a war, & our Shipin Captured and our Citizens made Slaves of
again, which will suerly e the case, no Consul in barbary ought to
be invested with more Power than the other, when that's the case tho
Different reagencys Plays into Each other's hands, to draw Preasents
and money from them, our Consuls in barbary having a sufficient
Salary to maintain them, ought to be Strictly forbiden not to Enter
into any line of Commerce what ever, that being the first Step taken
by the Heads of these reagencys to declare war with the Dlfferant
nations.
Relative to our Peace with Tripoli; and under the arantee of
the Dey of algier, I would not have our govt place too muc Confidence
in, least they should be deceivyd,I have eve reeon to beleave i t wiU
not Stand good long, as the Bclehaw and t'ge Head People of that

The Bashnw bid me inform our Minister a t Madrid, and Captain
O'Brien if the Presents and Brig did not arrive soon, he well knew
what Steps to take fiting out of twenty Cruisers, and Capture one
american ship, would pay him very Handsumly for his Trouble,
which he was determned to put into Execution, and had actually given
orders for fiting out five sail, that he would lett them know that Joseph
Bashaw Commanded in Tripoli; that he was under no restrant or
fear of the Dey of Algiers, and only respected him as a nabouring
Prince, that the motive for his making so favourable a Pence with the
united States, was oing to the long friendship that had Subsisted
between him and the former Dey, that he did not know how the
Presant Dey Could undertake to guarantee his Peace, without first
Consulting him, on this Important Point.
The Pride of the Bashaw is Such, and being urged on by His o m
Subjects as well as the Consuls of other nations, he will not Hisitate
one moment, to fit out his Cruisers take the Consul's Passport and
Capture our Shiping, the same he has dun by other nations during

S

298

to the rest of the American sub'ects then captives in this State, I
flatter myself I have not been ess zealous on this occasion. His
Excellency the Bashaw sent for me the 29%of last month by one of
his Raises, I immediately waited on his Excellency to know his commands, and to my utter astonishment informed me that he gave orders
to his cruizers (who had then five, to sail by the first fair wind) to make
reprizds on all American vessels, and re uested that I would acquaint
captain Ingraham with his intentions: reply'd that I wg obey His
Ex"?' orders but hoped that he wd countermand his orders until I
informed Mr Ingraham what was best to be done on this trying occasion. I accordingly went to the American House and communicated to M? Ingraham what had passed, we agreed (as I was charged
with the message from His Ex?) to call next day and know his Ex'*
final determination whether he wished that the American Charge
d'affaire would remain or go. Next morning we waited on His EX?
and when we were announced he requested to see the American Consul
and me, without any attendance. I informed him that I delivered his
message to M' Ingraham, he thanked me very politely, & told us his
motives for declaring war with the American States. "That he thought
himself not treated like a Sovere' , being so long ne lected by the
y informed from giers that his
United States, that he was credib'$
cruisers dare not presume to molest the Commerce of America without
the consent of the Algerines, but now that he was determined to let
them and all Europe know what the Bashaw of Tripoli could do, and
that he wm not to be intimidated by any power or state."
Those were his words in the presence of Mr Ingraham myself and the
American Broker, who I requested to be present. After His Excr
had finished, I expostulated with him, and made him understand that
in these troublesome times business could not be done with that facility
as in peaceable times, and that he must not attribute such ideas to any
neglect on their part, likewise that he must consider the distance from
America to Tripoli. He condescendingly replied that he would leave
the affair solely to me, knowing my fnendshi for him, as well as my
former services for the Americans, but that e thought i t necessary
that Mr Ingraham would go to Spain by a vessel of his own, and lay
this matter before Your Exc? hoping by such a step matters may the
sooner be accommodated. Mr Ingraham is constrained for the benefit
of his nation to depart in a few days, and leaves me here charged with
his affairs.

has declared against the great Republic, i t was occasioned by the
Grand Segnior sending a Chaoux in character of Ambassador from
the Port to said Regency's with a positive order so to do - The
Ambassador arived here on the 19" of last december & war was
declared on the 2lm?do. the whole French legation were immediately
put in chains & sent to the severest labour where they remaind forty
six days, they are now permited to remain in their houses to wait the
result of Buonapartes expedition who a t present is fortified a t Grand
Cairo & possesses fifteen of the principal villages in Egypt, this is the
current report of this City Mr Eaton & myself will proceed to Tunis in the Sophia in about eight
days from this date, I anticipate a happy conclusion with that Regency
for a much smaller sum than our instructions limits us .to From Tunis I shall write to Tripoli in order to be informd if their
will be a probability of prevailing on the Bey to accept a moderate
sum in cash, say to the amount of the value of the stores in lieu
thereof, if it should be found practicable I will proceed direct to Tripoli if not I will return to Algiers & wait the arival of the stores which
ought to be immediately dispatched, if not already on their passage
Should we have settled with the Bey of Tripoli for cash the stores d
be accepted by the Algerines in part payment of our annual stipulations
From the crews of the arm'd vessel we intend reinforcin the Sophia
with 15 men the remainder will return in a Polacre [Dey] elonging to
Mr OBrien which you may expect nearly as soon as you will receive
this I am sorry to inform you that Mr Ingraham seems to be unworthy
the confidence reposed m him by the Executive; his acct? w i l l prove
my conjecture not to be without foundation, the amount of them
from the 21" of Feb? 1797 unto Augt 1': 1798 is 8974X Mahaboobs
eaqual to Spanish dollars 131 15 - 53 cents - his acct current has
been forwarded to Mr Smith a t Lisbon by Mr OBrien last december &
I will send you a copy of it by the vessel that will take the crews of
the arm'd vessels home You will observe that this is wrote in haste, indeed every thing in
this Regency is done precipitate1 - for example a Sweedish Frigate
arived here yesterday with Matt ias Skjoldebrand Esqr his Sweedish

into effect our negotiations with Tunis & Tripoli Mr Eaton nor myself has not yet paid our respects to the Dey nor

(one of Algerine fleet) concerning his voyage

ALGIERS,
February 17, '88.

"I have met with an opportunity of informing you of my arrival
at this port, by a Swedish frigate, which put in here last night. I

had a very good passage from the Delaware, though a very wet one,
being perfectly under water d the time. ?Ve made the run m 30 days,
which was ten days less than capt. Maley, five days less than capt.
Smith, and six days less than capt. Geddes; and was fortunata
enough to fall in with no cruisers that we were afraid of. In the
Streights of Gibraltar, 6 large gun boats rowed off to us in a calm,
under French and Spanish colors, but after firing a few shot they
thought it prudent to retire. They then went and attacked two
large ships and a schooner, about 6 miIes from us - we were then
laying becalmed: one of the ships and the schooner they took, but
the other ship got clear, which proved to be the Five Brothers, capt.
Philips, of and from Boston, bound to Leghorn, carrying 12 six pounders and 40 men. Capt. Phdips informed me that the ship which had
struck was from Boston also, bound to Leghorn, mountrng 16 guns,
but could not learn the captain's name. The schooner which was
captured, was the Experiment, capt. Bender, of and from Philadelhia bound to Gibraltar. The Algerine fleet which sailed from
!hiladelphia,
are all safe arrived, except the ship Hero, eapt.

ALGIERS
22d Feb. 1799 SIR, On the tenth instant I had the honor to communicate information of the arrival, in this port, of the Brigantine Hassan Bashuw the Schooners Skjoldebrand and Lal& Eisha, and the United States
brig Sophia; also CapP Maley's report of his having parted with the
Ship Heroe on the American coast. Of this Ship we have yet no
account - She must be either captured, gotten into some port in
distress, or lost a t Sea On the 18'? the Officers, appointed by the Dey for the purpose,
took formal possession of the vessels; and this morning Consul Gen.
OBrien informed me that he had just now concluded a Settlement of
all accounts between the Dey and the United States, which he desired
me to sketch in the following cypher [Translation of coded message]
T?le whole of o w sti
ion for naval and military stores I have edirely
done away and pa' our stipzllated a n n d tribute with this regup
to two years and one half from the date ofthe treaty.
He has been assiduously employed in the business since the arrival
of the vessel: particulars will be reserved for a more certain conveyance I can state nothing with certainty on the affairs of Tunis - Mr
Famin has formed flattering expectations of the consulate, and has
artfully secured the friendship of the Bashaw and principal officers of
the government by having procured, a t the expense of 19 or 20
thousand dollars, and distributed among them the customary presents.
The Bashaw has declared that he will receive no other consul from the
United States - and did, in fact, discriminate him from the general
mancipation which involved his countrymen on the declaration of
War - Whether this res ect was paid to the Oidizen Famin, or to the
American Agent is prob ematical - But the same argument, which
established him, will undoubtedly induce his friends to transfer their
attachment - The Sapatapa must be gained by this inducement The Sophia, being reinforced with the crew of the Skjoldebrand, will
roceed to Tunis in a few days with Mr Cathcart and myself - It
as been thou h t most proper to wait here until after an adjustment of
our &airs wit[ this Regency, in order to avail ourselves of thef.iendZy
interposition of the Dey and his ministers - or, in the language of
Ca t OBrien "To get out an anchor to windward."
h e crew8 of the Hossan Bashaw and the Ldz Eiafa will return to
America in a polacre, purchased by the Agent of the United States, in
this place.

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1786 TO 1801

Mr Ingraham has exhibited an account current against the United
States commencing Feb. 1,1797 up to Aug. 1,1798, exclusive of Salary,
amounting to the enormous sum of twelve thowand one hundred &
fifteen 531100 dollars - and he has conducted the business in such a
manner that it will be difficult, if not impossible, for the United States
to evade payment.
The french are said to have taken possession of Naples - Buonaparte has established himself in Grand Cairo, planted his generals in
the government of the principal provinces of Egypt, and reinforced his
army with Arabs and Christians. Is i t not possible that he will turn
his eye towards the treasures of Al 'em, (The ublic treasury of Algiers

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1786 TO 1801

By it i t is hoped that our Consul General will be able, if those
armed vessels arrive safely, to cancel the demands for the large masts

and other cumbrous and very expensive articles and reduce the
claims of Algiers more than the amount of the cost of the vessels.
I should observe that the number of l a ~ maats
e
remaining to be
furnished is set a t 39 only. This is certa~nlyan error in the Purveyors statement; for I have heard of but three or four yet sent;
but others of a smaller size have been forwarded, and these have
been deducted from the original stipulation as if of the stipulated
size.
I should further observe, that mone only haa yet been paid to
Tunis: the furnishing of the stipulate stores (wh~chd
l cost upwards of a hundred thousand dollars) has been suspended, until an
essential alteration in one article of the treaty shall be effected, and
on which our consuls are instructed to negotiate with that power.
If they succeed, they are to endeavour to substitute something less
burthensome than masts and timber & other maritime stores.
I n the original estimate presented during the present session, my
object in pro osing an appropriation of 100,000 doll* - was not to
provide for a i that must eventually be furnished: but to discharge
some balances of debts incurred, and to enable the Purveyor to
forward some additional supplies. By the foregoing statement i t
appears that my estimate was too low; and that i t will be expedient
to make i t up to about 140,000 doll' or 150,000 dollars, the latter in
preference, seeing that in the course of the present year the value of
10,000 dollars, may probably be necessary for Tripoli. Expecting
too, a favourable conclusion of the further negociation with Tunis,
it would seem expedient to provide a t least for a partial fulfilment
of the original stipulations, - say to the amount of 50,000 dollars,
which would build one or two armed vessels (according to their size)
and cancel the demand of upwards of 100,000 dollars. But if instead
of armed vessels the new stipulation should be for rnon-ey, this can
hardly be expected to fall below the original stipulation for masts,
timber, and maritime and military stores. And considering that
nine months will elapse before the next meeting of Congress, it would
be safest to provide for such a conclusion of the negociation - say
100,000 dollars. A state of former appropriations and payments and estimate of the
sum wanting to discharge claims relative to the St Croix bounda
accompanies the documents relative to the Barbary affairs heremix
presented.

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS
April 19' I left Tunis & embark'd on board the Sophia we did not sail untill the
next day the wind being contrary Tripoli Friday the 5th of April 1799 At 3 P M came to an anchor in the Bay of
Tripoli we having an Algerine flaga t the fore top gall+mast head & our own colours
aft as customary - the Captain of the Ports boat came on board & asked from
whence we came & what was our business - we inform'd him the American
Consul was on board who had letters from the President of the U S of America
the Dey of Algiers & Bey of Tunis to hie Excellency the Bashaw of Tripoli At 3%P M, Mr Bryan M~Donoghcame on board in a boat with American colours
flying - I gave him all the private letters I had on board he being charged with
the British Sweedish & American sffairs the Consuls of said nations being absent
on businem Mr M~Donoghinform'd me that it was customary for the Consul or charge des
affaires of all nations a t Peace with Tripoli to inform the Bashaw when a vessel
of their Nation arived & get permission for the officers to land that he would
perform this ceremony, & would inform us when the Bey would give us an audience - At 25 minutes before six he came on board with a Chaoux & inform'd
that he was sorry to inform me that the Bashaw had determined not to receive
me as consul of the U S of America, as I had not brought the stores & brig promised by Captn OBrien when our peace was first agreed on here two years ago that
the Americans had not fulfiII1d thcir contract & that he did not consider himself
obliged to fulfill his that he had waited untill the consul arived in hopes that he
would have brought the stores with him, but aa it was not the case he would
wait no longer that he re uested I would send the letters from the Dey of Algiers
and Bey of Tunis to him he would answer them immediately & we might depart
when we pleased, that he would allow forty days from our departure before he
would order his cruisers to capture American vessels - that a t the expiration of
that period he would order the American fiag to be haul'd down & would make
known to the whole world that the Bashaw of Tripoli is an independent Prince
and would be respected as such in spight of the Dey of Algiers Bey of Tunis or
even the grand Signore I gave the lettens to the Chaoux and desired him to inform the Bashaw that I
had a letter from the President of the U S of America for him which I could not
trust to any person to deliver, I therefore requested he would give me an audience
and let me hear from himself his determination as I never put im licit faith in
me88agea - Mr MqDonogh inform'd me that I might depend the gashaw would
insist to have the Brig as Ca tn OBrien absolutely promised her to him in the
presense of Messre de Souza Farfaro and Mr M~Donoghdeclares that he has
heard them tell Ingraham so repeatedly - I informd Mr MFD that I never had
heard of any such promise that I was prepared the Bashawx demQ for the stores
by paying him an equivalent in cash but to give him the Brig was out of the
question entirely At 7 P M - The Chaoux came onboard & inform'd me the Baahaw would be
glad to see me two hours after day light - I requested him to inform the Bashaw
I would come on shore as soon as the Fortifications saluted the Brig as customry he said their would be no difficulty about that ceremony provided we would
promise to return the salute I told him the Bashaw might depend we would He then said the Bashaw requested we would send him the letters chest & other
articles which we rec? from his Vikil a t Tunis as the psssenger inform'd him we
had such things on board - I requested Capls Geddes to let him have the chest
promising to send the rest of the things on shore in the morning I gave him five
letters for the Bashaw from dift people in Tunis Saturday April 6th 1799 - We having waited untill 8 oClock & no salute being
fired from the fortifications Cap'n Geddes & myself went on shore & was stopt
a t the mold head by the h i s of the marine who in a very impolite manner sent to
inform us that the Bashaw had order'd that we should not be perm~tedto land &
that we must go on board again and remain untill the English Doctor went on
board that the Bashaw was now asleep & could not be disturbed At 10 A M Mr
MqDonogh came onboard & inform'd me what is contain'd in his report - N Q 1
of the enclosures 1 express'd a desire to see the Bashaw myself he said i t was
jmpossible unless I promised him the Brig, I inform'd him that I was not authorwed to do any such thing even should war be the consequence - He said I might
come on shore if I thought pro r & speak to the Rais of the Marine - I embraced
the offer & went on shore - pwas receiv'd with a great deal of hauteyr, by the.
Rais of the Marine who ask'd me where the stores were that was promdd to the
Bashaw two y a m ago - I inform'd him that they were ship'd on board a vessel

[Hero] which had eaild from the U S eighteen days before us that I had mison t o
suppose she was either lost, or taken that the stores for Tunia were likewise on
board of her & that the Bey had politely promised to wait nine or ten months
longer for them on his being inforrnJd by our consul of the misfortune? Yes said
the Rais & on your giving him twenty or thirty thousand dolls for his condescension - I declared that he never hinted to us, that he wish'd us to give him one
dollar and that I really believ'd that if we had offer'd him a pecuniary reward
that he would have been highly sffronted & was better pleas'd with our acknowledgment, which he consider'd quite sufficient es ecially as we were now engaged
in the same cause namely a war with France? Padded that I hoped the Bashaw
of TripoLi would a t least act with as much politeness. The Rais lauch'd & said the Bey of Tunis was the first moor that ever he had
heard of that would be affronted with a christin for offering him money, & added
he I suppose your friend the Dey of Algiers would likewise be affronted a t your
offering him money but I was in Algiers when a Frigate [Crescent] arrived from
America of 36 Guns loaded with guns & ammunition & the Dey was so far from
not receiving her that he seem'd very well pleas'd I inform'd him the Frigate
was sent in lieu of cash for the redemption of our captives which had been re
deerll'd upon credit above a year before, dont say any more interrupted the Rais
I know as well about your peace with Algiers as you do yourself, I was in Algiers
some months & if the Americans has friends there, so has the Bashaw of Tripoli,
have you any new proposals to make to the Bashaw? I answer'd I had not, he
then insisted to know what the consular presents consisted of I informd Mr
M~Donoghwho took a note of about two thirds of them & carried i t to his
Excellency - during his stay I was kept a prisoner in his appartment a t the
Marine
In about half an hour the Rais return'd from the Castle with Mr M~Donogh&
infomd me of the Bashaws terms see NQ 1 of the enclosures - the Rais added
that I had reel instructions from the lying dog OBrien who had informd him when
he was a t Algiers that he was Consul for Tunis & Tripoli likewise, and aa the
Bashaw of Tripoli & Bey of Tunis were dependent upon Algiers so were the Consuls there dependent upon him & could do nothing without him - I told him thnt
it was impossible that OBrien could be so weak, that I did not believe he had
ever said any such thing & wish'd him a good morning - What answer shall I
give the Bashaw added he - tell him said I that h
i
s proposals are beyond all
bounds, that I imagine he does not wish to be a t Peace with the United States,
that he supposes we have some rich ships in the Mediterranean - but you may
inform him that in consequence of our being a t war with France, that our ships
are all to well arm'd to be captured by any of his Cruisers & that I am very sorry
that his making such exorbitant demands upon us will oblige us to turn the very
arms against him which are now turn'd against our common enemy the French
Well said he? I am order'd by the Bashaw to inform you that you may wait for
the answers to the letters from the Dey of Algiers & Bey of Tunis if you think
proper, if not you may kt it alone that he is an Independent Prince & not to be
intimidated by Algiers Tunis nor even the Grand Signore, that if we wish t o be a t
Peace with him we must pay him for it & that he commands in his Kingdom as
well as the Dey of Algiers does in his - While I was on shore I sent n man (by
stealth) to inform Farfaro that I had letters of importance for him from the Bacries
& Bushnaes a t Algiem? he sent me word that he requested me to send them b
M IMvDonogh ta him b. to take care that none of the moon should see them,
beg'd for Godsake that I would not mention his name as it would be ruinous t o
him as well as detrimental to the affairs of the United States I requested the doctor to come on board to dine with me & wrote the followjng
letter to the Bashaw & sent i t by him accompanied with the one from the President
he having very politely offerd to explain them to his Excellency I requested Capts Penrose to go on shore with M T M~Donogh& wait for an
answer from the Bey who waa out on horseback viewing hi fortifications- he
delivered the letters to Farfan, and told C a p t ~Penrose that he would wme on

Sunday 7 t h [April] At meridian rec4 a letter from Mr MqDonogh which hformd
me that he had obtaind leave of audience from the Bashaw for me I went on
shore & waited upon his Excellency a t 1 P M in company with Mr MqD when I
ted nearly to the m e purport as I had done before to the %is of the
anne - the whole bone of contention was the brig which I refused him without
hesitation, he was very much enraged against Capos OBrien and made use of every
invective & term of reproach he could think of he then swore by God & his
Phrophet that OBrien had promised him the brig that had i t not been for that,
that he would not have concluded the Treaty with the U S, that he would have
her or her equivalent in cash that OBrien had reported that he was dependent
on the Algerines that he would now let the world see that he was not, that OBrien
would not be always a t Algiers that all his Cruisers had orders to bring him to
Tripoli if ever they found him onboard a neutral vessel & again swore that if ever
he was found that he would have him hung like a dog onboard of the vessel that
brought him in After an hours bravado & huckstering he told me that his ultimate terms were the Brig to be deliver'd to him immediately or the sum of eighteen thousand dollars
on the spot in her lieu and for the stores which you say are lost or taken 25000
dollars payable in a few weeks, and a consular present equal to the Danes and
Sweeds
I told his Excellency that I imagined he did not wish to prolong the
Peace, that his demands were ss exorbitant as unjust & that I could not treat
with him until1 he was in a better humour, I then wish'd him a good morning
He said he would give me twenty four hours to consider of i t & that from the morning of the next day the term of forty days should commence hefore he would
order his cruisers to capture american vessels On my return from the Castle T rec4 a letter from Farfan, enclosure NQ2 informing
me that he was sorry he could render me no assistance whatever Monday 8 t h [April] I requested Mr McDonogh to carry the following letter to
the castle & explain to the Bashaw its contents which he accordingly did & in
return brought me a note in Arabic which I sent to Farfaro to translate The
terms contain'd therein I rejected with disdain see NP 3 of the enclosures -

I then wrote a short statement of our affair8 & presented it to Capta Geddes
requesting his advice & opinion on the subject before I would come t o a conclusion - The Doctor informd Cap''+ Geddes that the Bashaw desired to see
him alone in the evening - I advised him to go by all means but to be very
circumspect in his answers t o the Bashaw? he went about 4 P M and after a

great deal of invective against OBrien & other frivolous questions which Capt'+
Geddes will inform you, the Bashaw informd him that if we would promise him
the Brig & the stores stipulated by treaty in a reasonable time and give him 13,000
dollam for the detention of said vesml & stores he would be content - Cap'"
Geddes informd him that he had nothing to do with the negotiation that if he
thought proper he might apply to me, but that he could tell him before hand
thst my instructions were limited & thst I dare not advance one dollar more
than I was order'd Well then answer'd the Bashaw you may tell him I have orderd the answers to
be wrote to the letters he brought for me I will send them in the morning when
he may go about his business - In the evening the Rais of the Marine came to
the house with two letters from the Bashaw one for the Dey of Algiers & the
other for the Bey of Tunis I ask'd him for the answer to the Presidents letter he
eaid i t was not ready but I should have it in the morning, and askd me what he
should inform the Bey I infom'd him he might say that I was sorry our negociation wse a t an end as his terms were so unreasonable that I would talk no more
on the subject as it would only be wasting time - for farther particulars see Mq
McDonoghs declaration & advice to me enclosure N Q4 - I t is something remarkable tiat the letters were seald in three diffr places so that it was impossible to
open them, this is contrary to the custom of Mussulmen who always sends their
letters open
Tuesday 9th IApril] - Fadaro's brother came to me this morning & inform'd me
t h s t the Bashaw had sent for the Governor of the Jews & ask'd him if the American
Consul had been a t Farfaro's house or if Farfaro had visited him the Governor
mid he was certain we had not seen each other take care they do not said the
Bashaw for if they do I know how to dispose of you and Farfaro, the Rais of the
marine a i d that he had placed spies on both our actions and if we visited each
other he would report us to his ExcellencyThe whole of this day we waited for sn answer to the Presidents letter, C a p ' ~
Geddes eent me his answer to mine of yesterday evening euclasure NQ5 This day C a p t d e d d e s and myeelf circulated a report that the Americans had a
number of vessels of war in the Mediterranean to protect their commerce against
the depredations of the French - we likewise reported that the Sophia would
immediately proceed to Malta on business of the U S - the reason we propagated
this story was because the Tripolines has five Cruisew now a t Sea, & they would
naturally euppo~ethat we would give information to the Portuguese squadron
thst acts in conjunction with AdrniraI Kelson
Finding i t necessary to come to some resolution & not having it in my power to
ask the opinion of our Consul a t Algiers I wrote a note to Capcn Geddes on the
subject and recQ his answer NQ6 of the enclosures

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS
9 P M The Rais of the Marine came from the Bashaw and brought an answer
( a d ' d up in three places) to the Presidents letter, I ssk'd him in what Language
i t was wrote he a n d in Italian, I then ask'd for a copy of the letter, he said the
Bashaw never gave copy's of his letters to any one, that the Prince of America
was the only person he wanted to know what was contain'd in it, Mr M~Donogh
said he would go by himself to the Castle and hear what the Bashaw bad to say
and a t the same time inform him that we would come and take leave of him in
the morning - previous to this I had authorized Mr M~Donoghto offer the Bashaw
in full of all demands for Brig & stores - eightsen thousand dollars, this was
done and refused by the Bsshaw, but his Excellency said if we would agree to
give him ten thousand dollars on the spot & romise h i the Brig in Nine months
from her departure he would be content MFDtold him he would endeavour
to persuade the Consul to agree to these proposals but that he was affraid it
would be out of his power
Wednesday loth April 1799 Mr M~Donoghwent to the Pallsee to give the
Bashaw an answer from me - I advised him to try & persuade the Bashaw to
accept cash in lieu of the Brig my particular reason for so doing was? because I
am convinced that if we give a cruiser to the Bashaw of Tripoli we would be
inevitably obliged to give a t least as large a one to the Bey of Tunis At 10 A M, Mr MP Donogh came from the pallace and gave us joy saying he had
agreed in the name of the Consul of the United States on the following tern Vizt That we should pay the Bashaw ten thousand dollars immediately for the
stores and detention - and eight thous4 dollam for the Brig as soon as possible?
that said sum shoud be consider'd in full of all demands from the United Stateg
of America, the Consular present excepted - this I agreed to immediately &
I assure you to many encomiums cannot be pass'd on the conduct of Mr MqDonogh
during the whole of this negociation to whoom the U S are certainly much indebted as Captn Geddea will inform you more particularly on his amval in
America At 5 p m I went to the Castle with the consular present and deliverd it to the
Bashaw - I now saw Leon Farfaro for the first time, who promised the Bashaw
the he would be responsible for the residue of the money I only having three
thousand Mauboobs in cash which I deliver'd with the presents - while we were
in the Castle the Flag of the U S was saluted with 21 Guns - the Bashaw orderd
his colouw to be hoisted on all the fortifications the different christian consuls
paid the U S the same compliment - the Sophia return'd the same number of
Guns and thus ended this ceremony While the Bashaw was looking over the presents he ask'd me if the United States
had sent the two pieces of holland as a sample I told him it was to dear to give
much away a t a time - he then said I must give him two more comq gold watches
I told him I would if I could purchase them here - I very fortunately had Kept
back a number of things belonging to the presents expecting a second demand I therefore gave him the two watchea without puting the U S to any farther
expense In the evening he sent his Compliments to me & beg'd it as a very particular
favor that I would let him have two of the brigs brass Guns as they would be
very serviceable to him for field pieces and that he would give the Brig two iron
guns in their place - I told the messenger I would consult Capt@Geddes & send
him an answer in the morning - A few moments afterwards one of the Chaougeg
came with an order from the Bey to receive a handsome present for proclaimi
the Peace, the Bashaw not having consider'd himself a t Peace with the U%
before now & that 'this awaite or present had not been paid before by any of
the former Agents - I told Farfaro to give him ten dollars, he said that he must
have one hundred a t least Not long afterwards he sent for some nun I had none
but sent him eight bottles of Cordials which I had purchased a t Tunis for my own
use I forgot to mention that the Bashaw desired me to take a house of his own which
was unoccupied - I inform'd him that I had not seen it, but that I would give
him an answer in a few days - I have since found that it is an old house entirely
out of repair & that he wants me to take it in order that he may ask me to repair
it a t the e nse of the United States I have therefore requested Mr MpDonogh
to inform
Bashaw that I would much rather live in the house where I now
a m - & if their is no other alternative sooner than displease the Bsshaw I will

take it and psy the annual rent which is one hundred Mauboobs a year & remain
in the h o w which I now occupy, which will be much better than to repair it
which would cost a t least five thousand dollars Thursdsy 11* [April] It is customary when ever a peace t a k a place t o give the
Bashsw from three to five barrela of powder this I knew could not be procured
here, I therefore thought proper to give the Bsshaw the two bra= cannon in lieu
of the powder & not to receive the iron guns which he promis'd in their place.
supposing they would be good for very Little
5 P M Capt~Geddes Mr MqDonogh & myself waited on the Baahaw & was rec*
in a quite diffc manner from what we were before
after some common phce
convemtion drinking coffee &q he said he would write other letteni to the Prince
of America the Dey of Algiers & Bey of Tunis & desired I would eend him the

now a t Peace and if the United '5tat.a of America were disposed to acknowledge
him to be a free & Independent Prince he was likewise disposed to do them every
favor in his power - I could not thank him for my soul - we retired and on our

SIR,Yours of the 15"htimo came safe to hand, wherein I am happy
to learn that Mr Cathcart with the presents is gone on to Tripoli, had
I been informed of that before, this disagreeable
been put a stop to and I still remained in Tripoli, but
last letter of Septr 25* 1798 wherein he desires me to inform the
Bashaw that he was daily in expectations of the arrival of the Consul
and Presents, as they were to leave America the last of July, which I
did, but the not arriving as soon as was expected, and the Bashaw
hearing of t e great Presents that were delivered at Tunis the 20*
of January on hoisting the flag of the U. S. the first time, the Bashaw
thought himself greatly offended and neglected by our government,
and gave immediate orders to fit out his Cruisers to make reprisals on
American vessels. This w'J have taken place had it not been for the
influence of Mr MoDonogh who was formerly charged with our affairs
by Captain O'Brien. This gentleman expostulated with the Bashaw
and got him to recal his orders, if in case I would consent to come
with his letter and deliver it to Your Excellency. I proposed writing
to A1 'em: this he would not listen to, and told me in presence of
Mr & ~ o n o h, that as the Dey commanded in Algiers,. so he commanded in 7! ripoli. The Bashaw likewise ordered me to lnform Your
Excellency that Captain O'Brien on making the Peace, promised him
a Brig, supposed to be the Sophia; that now, if the U. S. wished a
perpetual Peace with him he expected a Ship coppered, of 28 or 30
guns to be sent to him, as he had waited so long for the Presents.
I forward you the Bashaw's letter, as well as that of Mr MFDonogh

This copy is forwarded to shew the average strength of the Tunissien
cruisers The guns are from four to nine pounders - I n the ports of
Farena, Byzerte, Sfacs and Susa are an hundred and twenty cruisers:
but not in general so large as the above. Neither time nor opportunity has yet enabled me to procure an exact list of the marine strength
of Tunis. I t is much superior to Algiers. The vessels are better
reserved and managed, and the men are much more enterprising.
Eor the time of their cruising and cruising ground reference must be
had to Captain OBriens 'ournal, which is accurate. Their manner of
attack is uniformly boar ing. I t is however owing more to the weekness and timidity of the enemy they engage than to their own superior
valor or management that they make such progress in their mischief.
I have seen nothing yet, neither in Algers nor Tunis but what apears contemptible when contrasted with the force which a warlike
European, or even American might oppose to it. he whole marine
of both kingdoms would hardly give a relish to a british squadron and would not furnish a breakfast to such force as the Umted States
could without much inconvenience fit out, provided we were a t
peace with France. Algiers is as vulnerable by land as sea. The
city is defended in its rear by an enormous stone castle about 30 feet
high, standing on an elevated site which overlooks the town. About
one mile west of this is an eminence which commands the castle.
There is nothing formidable to the gaining of these heights by a
coup de main. The troops may be landed in a bay one mlle and an
half northwest of the city without annoyance; and in one night effect
the object. A battery of a few guns on the western eminence would
reduce the Castle at discretion: Or the latter may be carried by an
escalade, there being no ditch, pickets nor abatis to prevent it. From
these two positions veneeance may be poured u on the city and water
batteries below as irreslstably and as effectu y as the torrent upon
Sodom and Gomorrow, and with as much justice The world have been astonished and alarmed a t the failure of the
great expeditions formed against Algiers. But if the world were to
see the conduct of those expeditions its astonishment and alarm would
cease [?I together. Orileys assault was fitted to the genius of indolent
Spaniards. He landed in a bay, and encamped in a plain commanded
on all sides by high grownd - and he suffered his retreat to be cut
off from the sea - I n this situation he delayed the attack till the
moors from the country collected and came upon him in clouds -

Nor did he fight judiciously when attacked. The french bombardment was bought off - And the number of shells which the Admiral
had orders to throw into the city were in fact thrown one mile on its
fight, and are now many of them lyin in the same place entire - a
proof that they were not charged. Al!f the bstterie. of m e r s are in
a ruined conhtion: the gun carriages almost uniformly rotten; and
garrisoned by undisciplined, half-starved turks, who divote much
more time to their pipes and prayers than to their arms and police.
I t was impossible to get the exact number of guns mounted on alt
their batteries I intruded myself into every fort of importance: but
it was dangerous to make any surveys with accuracy from the extreme jealousy of the Mahometans. I t was very obvious however
that their guns like their carriages were in a neglected situation: I
could discover but one single apron among perhaps one hundred and
seventy guns. The iron guns appear never to have been scaled and the brass are with very few exceptions two thin for use Tunis is less vulnerable because more inaccessible. Not a un can
be brought by water to bear within twelve milmiles of it; and nobanding
can be effected within fifteen miles of it. But if once a proached it
has nothing like defence. Its waUs are very low; wit out ditches
and tumbling to the ground in many places. I t has many commanding eminences, untenanted, within reach of i t - and no defence.
But should the United States ever again have occasion to treat
with this government and redeem captives (and the thing is not impossible for they will have war with somebody) Byzerte oBers hostages
to secure a reciprocal treaty. This cit about, thirty five miles from
Tunis, contains twelve thousand so s, principally moors, and of
course without arms. The defence consists of t h e e batteries, or
castles, of free stone: one a t the N. W. angle of the city walls, the
other two opposite to each other a t the entrance of the mole; the
whole mounting about sixty cannon. The walls which are also of
free stone are about thirty feet hgh, six feet deep - and have para ets
and loopholes a t top for musketry; but they are without ditches. %he
castle a t the N. W. angle commands the town and other forts. This
is easy of access by landing troops on the west point of Cape Blanco
(where Scipio Afncanus is said to have disembarked his army to
march to Carthage) about six miles distant, under cover of darkness,
and proceeding in a right line and without obstruction to its walls.
An escalade mlght be effected with ladders without loss; for the castle
has no garrison, and is only watched by an old pensioner, who eve
night with perfect confidence and security commits his trust, wit
his W U ~ ,to the guardianship of Mahomet. The parapets of the wall
are now to be manned, and the garrison secured a t the mole, which
consists only of seventy men commanded by a turk from Tunis. The
whole city are couped a t once without a possibility of escape or resistsnce, for there is not one stand of arms amon the citizens nor
other defensive weapon, and may be forced on oard the vessels
before the least succour could be given from any quarter. These
hostages in America would give the command of terms; for being
principally moors i t would produce a general insurrection in the
c o u n q if they should not be redeemed a t any price. Eight regular
battaltons could effect this enterprise. I t would be more feasible
and more productive than an attempt to retaliate insults upon their
cruisere, which may be viewed as the wolves of the forests, it is almost impoesible to catch them, and when caught they m worth

nothing. We have heard much of the irresistible intrepidity of the
turkish military here. It is all hyperbola. Here is nothing like an
organized military. The camp, as their force is termed, is an awkm r d squad of insolent turks, whose only feats of valor consist in
swa ering once a year into the country among the wretched, defense ess moors to gather taxes. They have neither tactics nor
discipline. There is not a bayonet in Barbary.
Not much should be feared nor expected from a people whose
principal ministers, principal merchants and principal generals consume day after day in the same company smoking tobacco and
playin a t chess - While the citizens and soldiers are sauntering in
rags, sleeping under walls, or praying away their lives under the
shrines of depart,ed saints - Such IS the military, and such the
industry of Barbary - Yet to the shame of humanity they dictate
terms to powerful nations!!!
NB. The Sahibtaba is the proper mode of spelling ye title which I
have spelt Sahiptappa.

TUNISdthOf A p d 1799 SIR, Inclosed herewith I send you a copy of our Negotiation from
which you will learn, that the principal object of our Government,
on alteration in the 14" article, is obtained: also a copy of the note
of the articles demanded by the bey, as a present for himself on the
occasion of hoisting the flag;He says it is the same which he received
from spain on the like occasion and what he resolved to have from
United States, I resisted the demand, till he ordered me to accede
to i t or prepare to leave the Kingdom; I t has been all along understood that he should receive a present, but I am suspicious our
cidevant agent has projected this demand for the sole pu-rpose of
improving a refusal as an apology from procuring my exp+won from
the Country with a view of recovering his place; I have mdeed no
reason to cherish this opinion from any thing discover'd m his treatment personally; this is obliging, friendly and officiously good natured but every body of respectability here seem to agree in-pronouncing him a perfidious scoundrel; possibly the one half of t h s is meant
as complimentary to my feelings, & so i t is illy timed: for I have no
concerne from influence let his projects be what they will - His
disappointment is manifest, nor is i t unexpected; I t would indeed
be a singular circumstance if he were not so, and i t is natural to
suppose this disappointment may produce dispositions t? embarrass
me: hitherto however I have experienced nothing senous of this
nature, except i t be this demand, nor am I certain that this. suspicion
is fairly founded, whatever may be the truth of the fact, situated as
he is, he is rather to be considered an object of Comrmserahon than
alarm, I believe him embarrassed in his circumstances, I know him

extreemly mortified in loosing the consulate, & think he deserves
Consideration - after every other effort had failed to procure
passage for the Consul - for Tripoli, I have thought it necessary to
dispatch the brig with him he accordingly embarked the 1F inst for
that place, and the morning followin$ doubled cape bon with n fair
wind, the Vickele of Algiers and s i p o r Azulia, made great exertion
to procure a Vessel, and both pronounced it impossible; neutral
Vessels cannot be prevailed on to tauch a t that port, for fear of the
treachery of the bey, who, as I have before stated, is suspected of a
Coalition with Buonaparte, this might also be used as an argument
against risking the brig: but the emergency of our affairs there,
require the immediate agency of the Consul: the utmost which can
be sacrificed by the brigs going there, bears no proportion to the loss
which might be sustained in consequence of delaying to prevent a
WAR, I have advised Captain Geddess not to come to anchor in the
harbour of Tripoli, and Ordered him, in case the Bashaw should
demand the brig, to resist the demand by all the means in his power, I cannot but hope this measure will be productive of good, as soon
as I shall have adjusted the accounts of the United States with Mr
Famin, and the Contingencies of the Negotiation you will be furnished with my report

ALGIERSApril the @'! I700 DEARSIR, YOUwill observe that the letter I had from Consul
Eaton was dated the 21'' of March, but Bockeris & Busnahs had a
letter from thier friend Solomon Azuli, Eatons Banquire a t Tunis,
this letter was dated 5 days after Eatons, and Mentioned that the
Artieles, which were in the Treaty, & objected too by the Senate,
would be alter'd, agreeable to the request, or as Consul Eaton thought
proper to have them & that the whole business in Tunis, relative to
the affairs of the United States, would be settled on the plan proposed,
if so, the government of Tunis will accept of Cash payments, m lieu
of the Maratime & Military Stores, I am not too sanguine on this
business, as I have not this Officially from Eaton, but I shall know
by the return of the Sophia, which I expect here the first Easterly
winds and with the first spurt of said Winds, the polacre will sad
from here - destined for Philadelphia Consul Cathcart still remains a t Tunis, I have advised him to
proceed and for Eaton to push him on for Tripoli, as there is a Necessity of his being there on many important Considerations -

I mill now observe to you my D? Sir, & I pray God that you or the
United States, will never loose sight of it, or of this National Object,
that is the great and urgent Necessity of keeping up a Marine force
the frigates, sloops of war, brigs & Schooners, for it is my Candid &
Sincere Opinion that there is the greatest necessity for this Marine,
that there is no great dependance to be put in any of those Barbary
or Christian States, we might have an extended Commerce, a sudden
WAR, out starts the Corsairs, in comes 60 Sail of Americans, and all
this might be prevented, by our having a fleet of Corsairs Armed and
prepare'd, & ready to act on any suddpn emergencies, those people
would know, & should see, that we had some ships of force, to defend
and protect our Just Rights, & without Corsairs, we have no business
of an extended Commerce, or Occupying these out posts, the deans,
Swedes, British and infact all nat~onsthat has Commerce in the
Mediteranian and Seas Adjacent, has at all timcs, frigates & Corsairs,
ready to afford i t the Necessary protection, and now and then one or
two of the United States, frigates, might call in or off Algiers and
Tunis, & towards Italia, it would shew them the United States had
if Necessiated some C o r s k to protect their Commerce OBrien, Eaton & Cathcart might be compare'd unto 3 light houses
erected on 3 dangerous shoals, said light houses erected to prevent
Valuable commerce runing thereon; said light houses has been erected,
a t a Vast expence to the Commerce of the United States, to prevent
Merchant Ships runing thereon, i t will cost the United States some
money to keep said light houses in Repair, to keep the requisite lamps
burning and other Necessary expences, * * *

TRIPOLI
IN BARTApril 13" 1799
SIR,When I was a t Algiers, you gave me to understand, that I
would have no di%cultv whatever to encounter a t Tripoli, on my
arrival here I found i t Otherwise; I have however surmounted them
all by the help of our friend Doct' McDonogh who I am sorry you have
so much neglected; I am now happy to inform you, that the United
States of America is in perfect harmony with this Regency (if I may
be allow'd the term) the particulars of our negotiation you will be
informed of by Captweddes, as I do not think proper to detain the
brig longer than I can avoid, otherwise I would give you a detail of
the Negotiation, which you must now request of the Secretary of
State I have been informed from Indubitable authority that you promised
the Brig Sophia to the Bashaw of Tripoli, and CaptQGeddes mformed
me that you told him, you had made the Bashaw a Kind of a promise
by the way, of G r e ~ i n gthe way, now Sir you h o w that such promises
must be f u m e d , I therefore was Oblidged to redeem your promise by
Giving the Bashaw 8,000 dollars, in lieu of said Vessel, and for the
Stores, and his condescension in waiting so long for them, 1000 110,0001,
the Contingent expences will be about 1500 which in all makes
19,000 [19,500], Consular presents exccpted out of which I have
saved one diamond ring one repeating watch, four Silver ditto, two
snuff Boxes, one piece of holland and two dozen of handkerchiefs Farfara has become responsable for said Sum which is to be aid
immediately, I therefore request you will honour said Farfaraysgills
upon sight, to the amount of 17,000 dollars, the two thousand Algerine
Sequins, which I received from Azulia, I have given to the Bashaw, in
part payment, Farfara has not made out his accounts yet, when he
does, I will forward them onto you, MT Ingraham has not left one single document in this Office, he
has taken even the treaty away with h m ,I am Credibly informed that
he has not spent above fifty dollars on the house I now live in and as
for his public dinners, there is no body here to eat them M' Eaton and myself has found by experience that the interferance
of the dey of AQyers with either of the other regencies has been
detrimental to the affairs of the United States, our Government must
therefore drop the Idea of Soliciting his mediation, & endeavour to
Cultivate the friendship of the reigning Princes for the time being, as
both here and a t Tunis they are determined to be respected as independant princes -

By the arrival of your Consul, James Cathcart, We have received
your kind Letter dated the 21s' of December last, the contents of
which have been duly attended to. In answer we have now to inform
you that we have been much surprised to see the said Consul arrive
without bringing with him, after a two years expectation the present
of ammunition agreed upon a t the conclusion of the last Peace, - as
well as the Brig which was promised us by Captain O'Brien. This
your negligence with regard to us, had in such a manner offended us,
that we were resolved not to receive the said Consul; But our Doctor
B. M. Donogh has made us so great intreaties to prevail upon us to
enter into a negotiation with the said Consul respecting the points
alluded to, that with a View to gratify his desire and to preserve unaltered the friendship which subsists between us, we have agreed to do
i t ; And after some controversy on the subject, we have agreed to
receive the inconsiderable sum of ten thousand Pezzi duri[*](a coin)
in the place of the Present of ammunition, and that of Eight thousand
Penzi duri as a substitute for the Brig aforesaid; Whereby we have
consumated the Peace which shall, on our side, be inviolate provided
you are 'CVilhg to treat us as you do the two other Rqencies, without
any difference being made between us. - Which ~sthe whole of

Dear SIR- Your esteemed favors of the 15t@of March I rec'd the
22"c of April and a letter dated March 24'@from Cap. Ingraham, then
at Carthagena which was the first information I had on that &air,
but it was what I daily expected owing to the detention of the stipulated
articles, the peace being made 2%years on this affair of Tnpoly I
apply'd to the Dey he wrote immediately with all his force Mr Cathcart sailed in the Sophia the 1" of April from Tunis. He had a strong
letter from the Dey telling the Bashaw Algiers was responsable on
American affairs and had some presents and cash from here which
with his powers from the government of the U. S. I suppose he has
studied and arranged our affairs as I have information from Tunis
that the Sophia returned there from Tripoly the l B t @of April but my
letters from Consul Eaton is of the 16Q by the Dey's influence Eaton
is in his post Famin is unshipped and remains a poignant enemy to
the interests of the U. S. I perceive by Consul Eaton's statement to
me that since he has been in Tunis he has paid 32 thousand dollars
The presents he carried from here was upwards of 6000 Dollars and
i t seems the Bey demands presents of friendship of nearly 41,000
Dollars. The three articles which prevented the Senate from ratifying
the treaty with Tunis was so modiiied or agreed to by the Bey A few
days afterwards he retracted and that part of the busmess is unfinished
Consul Eaton made the Bey an offer in lieu of the maritime and
military stores and all demands 50,000 Dollars. The Bey rejected i t
and added, as viz. "Consult your government I give them six months
to give me an answer and to send the presents If they come in that
time well if not take down your flag and go home" Under all those
considerations I intend to send the Sophia to Lisbon with the whole
dispatches and statements of our affairs to Mr Smith and with bills
for him to pay those debts incurred I have no money but what we
get on cre&t from the Jews they must be paid Also there is 24,000
Dollars relative to the ship Fortune I n fact Sir these are all unavoidable expences incurred in making our peace and fulfilling some parts
of our negotiations and they must be either paid or there must be an
end to our affairs I t will be in my opinion a question with the U. S.
Is it our interest to be on those terms at peace or war with the Barbary
States If peace pay those bills and expect others If War h t
send forward your corsairs withdraw your commerce and be prepared
for maintaining a young Marine in Europe for periods of years. On
the 22" of february I had a full settlement of our affairs with this
regency The whole peace stipulation is settled and 2 years and 9
months of our annuity Depend I have saved on this business to the
U. S. full 150 fathom of cable The 1/3$9 of the cargoes of the Independent Jupiter and Newport was not receipts for so that on account
of the ignorance or neglect of Mr Clark this was a dead loss to the U. S.
and I had no alternative but to give the brig corsair to the Dey He
said the U. S. gave the frigate & great sums to the late one Cap. Smith
in the U. S. Polacre the Dey sailed the 25Q of April having eight guns 9
pounders with 60 men The crew of the late Hassan Bashuw and b l a h
Eisha I ex ect by this time he is well advanced on his passage to Philadelphia $he Sophia is reinforced with the officers and crew of the Skjoldebrand and has 58 men I expect her here daily The Hero Captain
Robertson we have no account of and I suppose said vessel is foundered.

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS

The foregoing list and annexed echedule exhibit in a summary view the mast
correct information attainable of the naval force of Tunis, the species of armed
vessels, the number of their guns and men, and the times of the year they go to
sea, also the increase of the navy the last ten years. * * * But twenty
cruisers have gone out this year ae will be seen by the schedule. These are not
carried out in my columns of total numbers because of preserving the monthly
proportion of cruises.

The cruising ground of the corsairs of this Kingdom haa heretofore been in the
vicinity of Corsica. Sardinia, and Sicily, on the coast of Genoa, Tuscany, Naples,
Calabria, and in the entrance of the Adriatic Sea,- and even as far up as Venice.
But these coasts, havin fallen under the protection of the belligerent powers,
now d o r d no game. t h e i r mode of attack is uniformly boarding. For this
their vessels are peculiarly constructed. Their long latteen yards drop on board
the enemy and afford a safe and easy conveyance for the men who man them for
this purpose. But being always crouded with men, they throw them in from all
points of the rigging and from all quarters of the decks, having their sabres grasped
between their teeth and their loaded pistols in their belts, that they may have the
free use of their hands in scaling the gunnels or netting of their enemy. I n this
mode of attack they are very active and very desperate. Taught by revelation
that war with the Christians will guarantee the salvation of their souls, and
finding so great secular advantages in the observance of this religious duty their
inducements to desperate fighting are very powerful. Proper defence against
them are high nettings with chains sufficiently strong to prevent their being
cut away - buskshot plentifully adminietred from musquets or blunderbusses and lances. But it is always best to keep them a t distance that advantage may
be taken of their ignorance a t manoeuvre. -

(Triplicate)
On the eighth of September last five Tunisian corsairs, carrying nine hundred
and ninety men, landed in the grey of the morning upon the island of St Peters in
the dependence of Sardinia, captured and brought prisoners to Tunis seven
hundred women and children and two hundred and twenty men. The description
given me by the British consul of the barbarous and brutal conduct practised upon
these unfortunate defencelees wretches would shock a savage. The able bodied
men of the island being a t their vintages in the country these people fell a feeble
sacrifice to the merciless assailants. Decrepit age, delicate youth, and helpless
infancy were tumbled head-long from their beds, precipitated down flights of
stairs, shoved out of street windows, driven naked in an undistinguished croud,
without respect to sex or circumstance, through the streets, and crammed promiscuously into the filthy hold of one of their cruisers; in this manner bro't across the
sea, and in this wretched plight goaded with thongs thro' the streets of the city
by their relentless captors; driven to the common auction square, and consigned
to slavery. - The King of Sardinia, distressed 8s he has been on the other hand
by the crimes of the republic, has not hitherto found the ability to redeem them
a t the enormous sum of six hundred and forty thousand dollars, which the Bey
demanded. He hae lately appointed an aged and respectable Count Porcile,
who hss been four times before an ambassador to this court, and who is now
here to negociate the terms of their redemption. He has a t length prevailed on
the Bey to accept the sum of two hundred and seventy thousand dollars, but the
tefms of payment are not yet agreed upon. There is however a prospect of their
release.
The old, the infirm, and the infants, who were unfit for slaves have been obliged
to shift for themselves. They could not find subsistence. Charity dealt her
sparing morsel to them. - They have suffered much; but the consuls severally
contributed something to their relief. I received a letter from the Sardinian
Secretary of State, and another from the Consul General appointed to be charged
with the affairs of all nations who have not a consul established in that Kingdom,
solliciting the good offices of the American Consul in this sffair: the latter seemed
to claim as an obligation, intimating that he had often rendered disinterested
services to Americans in Sardinia. - I gave one hundred dollars.

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1786 TO 1801

When war was declared against France the consul and all his countrymen were
confined in close prison and their property sequestered, notwithstanding a treaty
stipulation that the consul and others of his nation should be allowed one year
after declaration of war to adjust their affairs and depart the Kingdom. * * *
I am a t this moment convinced that i t was with a view of finding pretext for a
war that the bey and his minister laboured with so much perseverance to dragoon
or manoeuvre me into a promise of a regalia of jewela and a cruiser. I t is my
decided opinion that except something shall appear for us before the first of February the die will be cast against us and a sweep made among our merchantmen.
I wish my alarm may prove the child of timidity, but since, from arguments
already given, i t has taken possession of my belief, I cannot forbear my importunity on a subject of so much importance. We owe our peace a t this moment to
to the victory of Lord Nelson.
I submitted my opinion by Captain Geddes that a small cruiser of 18 or 20
guns would be well given. I am still of that opinion in case a force be not sent
out. I have before said that there is no access to these courts without paving the
way with gold or cannon balls. Humanity condemns the policy of putting arms
into the hands of these madmen, but we are not singular in this policy. Besides.
considering the intrigues of our rivals here we ought perhaps to feel no remorse on
this score other than what the danger of those arms being turned against ourselves
should produce. I have also advanced my opinion tllst a respectable armed force
in this sea would be among the best precautions against a predatory war. How
often is the Maxim repeated in America, "To preserve peace be prepared for
war?" But how should $his preparation be productive of its object if the world
are ignorant of it7 * * *
Were I to dictate measures to the United States they would read thus.
"Send
out the stipulated regalia; for being stipulated it is become a debt, - accompany
i t with a respectable force and under our guns make the tender on the legal
principles of a tender, that if refused they should annul the obligation. After this
act of justice is performed, if the President should think proper to offer something
conciliatory, something 'to turn away wrath' let it be done gratuitously, and in
such a manner as not only to confer an obligation, but to impose a sense of it
also. Pray let nobody suspect I am for war: Otherwise. - These measures I
do believe necessary precautions against so serious an evil. - But they will
be attended with expenses.

I have earnestly insisted on the necessity of showing a force in this
sea. - The arguments advanced in favour of the measure accompany this in two letters to Colonel Pickering. If they should coincide
with conclusions you may form from the premises it is ho ed they will
have your support. The atience and submission with w ch we have
suiTered spoliation and ro bery from Algiers have incouraged the insolence and avarice of Tunis. The consequent demands of the Bey I
consider as inadmissible as they are unjust. I t would be degrading
to the United States to yield to them. I have 'ven him no reason to
expect i t so far as it respects the demand of j e ~ c % but
; on the contrary

g

li

have assured him that my government would reject the demand. We
must a t some period dare begin to resist demands of this nature. Why should farther sacrifices be made before we try the experiment of
resistance? Humility invites insult. The greater our concessions
the more accumulated will be the demands upon us. Nothing can be
more absurd than to expect by presents to satisfy the demands of
these marauding and beggarly courts, who have no sense of gratitude,
no sentiments of honour, no respect for justice, no restraint from fear,
and whose avarice is as insatiable as death, - * * * But what
is still more extraordinary and still worse, we have r e d been stupid
enough to engage the friendly mediation of Algiers to o tain a peace
with Tunis, and have sollicited the guarantee of the former for the
goad faith of the latter! This is placing money in the hands of one
highwayman to keep i t out of the hands of his companion, and taking
one horsejockey to guarantee the word and honour of another. The
consequence is we are plundered and disgraced without securing our
object, while our agents have shared the booty. These arrangements
were brought about by a brace of Frenchmen and their Hebrew coadjutors who have been allied and sharers with the regency in the
produce of their agency. * * *
I am more and more convinced that the mode of our negociation
with these regencies must be so reformed as to remove the impressions
that weakness and fear have dictated the measures to which we have
hitherto yielded.
Already have the United States expended more than one hundred
thousand dollars in their nerrociations with Tunis. without securim a
eace. - The stipulated Ggalia and extraordiiry demands of &e
gey, if complied with, will amount to little short of two hundred thousand more. Without this compliance we are threatened with war. - I
do not believe we are much more safe at Algiers. For the least delinquency the government of the United States will be arrainged a t the
tribunal of the otent Dey, and ammerced in damages a frigate or a
74. - One ha'! f of these expenses the United States may place to the
account of French agency. My predecessor here is a slave, and a base
one because a voluntary one, besides being a swindler and a Frenchman.

g

But to return to the subject. America must shew a force in this
sea. National interest, honour, safety demand it. The appearance
of a few frigates would produce what the whole revenue of a country
would not. They would produce impressions of terror and respect.
Without force we are neither safe nor respectable here. Does not
good policy dictate this caution agalnst aggression before we shall be
compelled to the measure to chastise outrage? * * *

Let the government of the United States at least send one ship of war to
convoy out the regalia to Tunis that these people may be persuaded thd
defense grows in our country.

SIR,

Interest was making with the governor of Porto Farina and the
Sappatappa to influence the Bey mto the measure, and the prospect
was considered not wholly desperate though not flattering. I had
assured the Sappatappa that if he would procure a final settlement
and discharge of all demands for any sum short of ninety thousand
dollars he should be entitled to receive ten thousand dollars promptly
in consideration of his good offices. - He seemed much inclined to
the argument.
On the 28': ult. he gave a dinner a t his garden, Present, the English
and Imperial consuls, the Portuguese and Sicilian ambassadors and
the american agent, besides several principal Turks. I n the morning
of this day I took the opportunity to obtain hi decided opinion relative to the cash substrtute. He gave it that the project was not
feasible; said that the Bey had purchased and was purchasing a11 the
ammunition he could procure: that he had sent vessels to Trieste,
Mahon, and Spain for maritime and military stores, such as he expected from America, without being able to procure them. That he
was sending to Gibraltar and England with the same views. That the
delinquency of the United States had occasioned great disappointment,
p&rt.icularlyso a t the present crisis. It had operated to retard and
indeed to defeat plrtns of national defence and enterprize the entire
execution of which de ended on these munitions of war. He was
authorised again to dec are that no sum of money would be considered
an equivalent to that regalia. He hoped, if the timber could not be
procured immediately, for I told him i t was yet growing on the sources
of our rivers, that the guns, ammunition, pitch, tar, rosin, cordage,
and such other articles as are to be found in our magames, would be
forwarded without delay.
It is worthy of remark here that while we were a t dinner a body
of Turks came armed to the garden, and even into the court-yard,
md demanded money, alledging that fh gwe~nment having made
peme with every body had reduced them to famine; but they were
resolved not to starve! This circumstance confirms the opinion heretofore advanced that they must be let loose upon some body.
On the 29" the Portuguese and Sicilian Embassadors embarked
for their respective courts; the former having concluded a peace with
thie regenc for three years, the latter during the present war m
Europe.
raised a new spectre of alarm to my vieion. What
now is to block the corsairs within the straits? What now shall hinder
them from cruising from the cape of Good Hope to the O r h e islands?
England is in a kind of alliance with them - and France wi not op-

pose their outrage against Americans. I resolved therefore once more
to see the Bey and ush if possible the project of a cash payment.
Accordingly on the gurth of July I waited on him a t his palace and
requested him to state what sum of money would satisfy his claims and
cancel all his demands? He laconically answered "No sum whatever, you need not think more of it". He observed that, his minister
had communicated to him my proposals on this subject and had received his instructions to give me a conclusive and h a 1 answer to
them; which he presumed had been done. I said the minister had
made the communication, but as he was daily lessening the number of
his enemies and of course diminishing the necessity of these munitions of war, I hoped he would consider the impediments which
might retard their anival and would prolong the time. He said i t
would be early enough to enter upon this subject after the given time
shall have expired.
I now consider that my ultimatum, agreably to instructions, has
been proposed in a manner best calculated to insure success, but finally
rejected. It remains with the exertions of the United States to preserve the peace. Everything conspires to confirm my suspicion that
the regency does not wish it, and that the commerce of the United
States is marked out as the victim of Tunisian piracy. I thought I
had exhausted the subject of this suspiction in my last letter; but new
evidence appears to support it.

be found in the inclosed list.
The residue of the articles must be provided in the course of the
winter, to be shipped in the Spring. This residue cannot be ascertained until the Hero & Sophia are loaded: But the invoice of the
Hero's original cargo, now inclosed, will give you u pretty just idea of
the bulkey articles which will remain to be transported. The lumber
can be procured in New Hampshire & Maine; a t least the articles
required for Tunis, Colg Thompson of Portsmouth has offered to
procure; and he will do the business faithfully & punctually.

To Secretary of Sate from William Eaton, U. 8. Consul, Tunis

TUNIS64 Dec. 1799 SIR, With infinite satisfaction I have the honor to inform you that
within a few days our affairs have assumed a new and promising
aspect* - Since the departure of Doctor Shaw for America on the
17* Oct. I have paid court to the vanity and avarice (prsdominent
passions) of the Sapatapa: and have a t length persuaded him, what is
undoubtedly true, that he would find his red interest more secure in a
commercial intercourse than in a war with the United States; and that
Americans would be his safest carriers to Spain, where he has opened
an extensive commerce, the ships of all other nations being interrupted either by the belligerent powers of Europe or by the Corsaires
of Algiers - I observed to him that the con&tions of these advantages were known to him; that I had during the short time of my
residence here received propositions from the American Consuls of
Leghorn and Barcelona to introduce a trade here, and also applications from two American Masters of vessels to get them freight here:
in reply to which I had stated to them the articles of our treaty.
Since which I had heard no more on the subject - I t was only
necessary to inform my Countrymen that they were not equally
respected here with other nations to determine them against coming
here let the considerations of individual profit be what they would He now experienced the truth of what I eight months ago declared to
him That an American merchantman would never enter a port of
Tunis, except compelled, until they should be informed that the terms
of our treaty were more favorable The Sapatapa acknowledged a propriety in my observations
expressed an earnest desire to employ Americans as carriers to Spain,
and intimated his opinion, that if the regalia arrived m season, there
would then be no impediment to an arrangement of our affairs more
satisfactorily - He promised to open the subject to the Bey, and
to give i t his support - He entered very candidly into a detail of
the causes which had embarrassed our negociations here, N-hich shall
appear a t large on my journal but which may be reduced here to two
words French intrigue and Jewish inJideEity 7
I saw the Bey this morning, and have h~ promise of forebearance
sixty days - in the mean tune, it is hoped, we may have arrivals
from America - Famin has tried to insinuate that the Government
of the United States have no serious intentions of f u l f l h g their
engagements with Tunis - He has not succeeded - That slave
has been a thorn in m side - But he has now no influence a t
court. The Bey's fami y Physician informed me, a few days since
a t dinner with me, that the extm.ordinary demand for jewels was
actually projected by him, (Fnmin) and stipulated after my arrival
in T u s - That the Sapatapa heasitated to introduce it as i t had
not been stated in any of his former communications and that Famin

1

338

told him not to hessitate - he (Famin) could find document to
support the demand - I have uniformly treated this jremh pirute
with polite attention, taking care to keep the commanding grounds,
till I have finally defeated dl his projects of mischief - And, if
nothing interfere with my present arrangements, have now a flattering
prospect of ultimately terminating our affairs with this regency more
favorably to the interests of the United States and more conformably
to the instructions of the Government.
*Three thine have operated to produce this change of projects at Court.
1 Doc. Shaw'e departure for America. 2 My assuring the Bey of a prospect of
an accommodstion between the United States and the French Republic, and
conwquently an American armed force in this ses. 3 A conviction on the mind
of the Sapatapa that if he make war with U. S. he may as probably loose as
win - and that by cultivating harmony he may avail himself of American enterprize to aid his commercial views

Dr SIR Want of opportunity join'd to an indifferent state of
health, & I may add want of matter worthy yrattention has occasioned
my not renewing the comes ndence I was formerly honor'd with
when in captivity, give me eave a t presnt to solicit a continuance
of that honor, & to transmit for your perusal the most prominent
transactions of this government since my arrival here, wbich since
the adjustment of our afiairs with this Regency for the Sum of 18,000
dollars to the Bashaw for the stipulated stores, detention, & the Brig
Sophia, which it seems had either been promised to him by our Agents
or he had forged the demand, as you have already been inforrn'd by
the Bashaws letter transmitted to you by Mr Ingraharn, there has
nothing worthy notice taken place smce except Comodore Campbells
expedition against this place & the depredations commited by the
Cruisers of this Regency upon the commerce of Nations with whom
they are at Peace & who has paid them considerable sums to insure
the continuance of their friendship. I have transmited a detailed
acct of said expedition & every other political transaction of this
Regency a t difTerent times to Mr OBrien which I presume he has
already informd you of I therefore shall not tire your patience with a
long repetition On my arrival a t Tripoli on the 5" of April I was refused permission
to land & was infom'd that the Bashaw would not receive me as
Consul from the United States as I had not brought the Stipulated
Stores & had positively refused him the Brig which he declared was
promised him by M? OBrien, Mr Bryan MgDonogh who was charged
with our affairs by Ingraham was the messenger employ'd on this
occasion by both parties and in every respect espous'd the cause of
the Bashaw, he was piqued that neither our government nor OBrien
had taken any notice of him for the services he had render'd them &
the crew of the Ship Betsy when here. I therefore thought i t adviseable to secure his interest by a douceur which had the desired effect
as he afterwards proved very usefull to us here & facilitated the
negotiation as much as lay in his power, a t the same time I have
resson to believe that he occasioned the first obstacle & by his influence persuaded the Bsshaw not to give me an audience in order

that I should be necessitated to employ him by that means founding
a plea for a reward he en'oys the entire confidence of the Bashaw &
in tbddition to the medict i assistance he renders hii family, he is his
Excellencys project maker by which means he has amass'd six or
seven thousand dollars in a few years in short Sir he is the Famin of
Tripoli, and altho' it is necessary to treat him with politeness it would
be very improper to entrust the affairs of the United States again to
his guidance as he is certainly le trds humble s e d e u r des eve-nemeds,
& would plead pro, or con, or both, for money his venality is remark'd
by all the Consuls here, & what is very extraordinary he is a t once
both caress'd and despised. On the 6* Mr McDonogh came on board & gave me the Bashaws
demand in writing the substance of which was that if Mr Cathcart
did not promise the Bashaw the brig or fiftty thousand dollars in lieu
of her the Stores Stipulated by treaty & Consular presents that he
would not receive him as Consul from the United States of America
but would declare war against said states in forty days from this
date After a good deal of menacing & huckstering on the part of the
Bashaws Agents, & opposition to his unreasonable demands on mine
I obtain'd an audience on the 7'p when the Bashaw confirm'd what
I was before inform'd by his emissaries, & added a great many invectives against OBrien for denying that he had promised him the
brig & said that he was neither dependent on Alpers or the Grand
Senior and that by declaring war against the United States of America
he would let the world see that he was an Independent Prince and
would be respected as such, I combated his insinuations & unjust
demands but with little success, finding it impossible to treat with
him verbally, I retired & wrote him a letter where in I remonstrated
on the impropriety of his conduct to a Nation that had never injured
him or his subjects, but on the contrary had already paid him a considerable sum to insure his friendship & whose Agent was now prepared to fulfil every Stipulation of the Treaty subsisting between the
two nations, that the Stores were ship'd for Tripoli before I left
America & their not arriving in time was owing to some accident over
which human foresight had no control? that never theless I had no
objections to pay his ExcelYan equivalent in cash for them, provided
he would c o n h e his demand within the bounds of reason and equity the Doctor ex lain'd my letter to the Bashaw who answer'd it in
Arabic a trans ation of which in Italian is as follows -

Of this sum 13,000 dollars shall be paid promptly and for the

from the date of the present. If upon the expiration of the said time
the aforementioned sum is not forthcoming, the Peace shall be broken,
and should the Consul want to leave, he can leave, but if he remains
he shall be a slave. We did not grant time to the first agent and we
have granted to the present Consul a period of six months only out of
s
consideration for the Italian doctor and in compliance with h ~ wish.]
The above proposal I instantly rejected with disdain & returnd to
the Bashaw by the Doctor with the contempt such an unreasonable
demand merited - On the 8'? the Minister of Marine was employ'd
by the Bashaw to negociate with me - this evening I requested him
to inform the Bashaw that I could not comply with his demand that
i t was of no service whatever for us to talk any farther on the subject,
that I was sorry his conduct towards the Umted States would oblige
them to turn the arms against him, which were now employ'd against
our common enemy the French, for he might depend the United
States would never put up with so palpable an imposition - I father
requested him to inform the Bashaw that I would do myself the
honor to wait on him in the morning to hear his ultimatum & if he
did not alter his opinion by that time, that I would sail in the brig
for Tunis & Algiers the first fair wind On the loth the interest of the Minister of Marine & M' Donogh
being previously purchased I agreed to pay his Excellency in full of
all demands from the United States, the sum of ten thousand dollars
for the Stores & eight thousand for the Brig Sophia which I have every
reason to believe was promised to him by Mr OBrien -the contingent
expences amounted to 1500 dollars & the Consular presents which
I procured a t Philadelphia & Algiers cost about 4000 more the whole
amounting to the sum of 23,000 Dollars The Flag of the United States
was saluted with 21 Guns & they ended our Negotiation - I
immediately paid the Bashaw 3500 dollars in cash whch I had drawn
a t Tunis, & gave Bills on Tunis & Algiers for the rest which were duly
honor'd, & I am happy to inform you that nothing has happen'd
since to disturb the harmony subsisting between the United States
& this Regency -

DEPARTMENT

Philad* Jany 11% 1800
SIR, The Brig Sophia arrived with your dispatches the latter end
of August, when the yellow fever had again obliged the public officers
to remove from this city. New York was visited with the same disease a t the same time; and the inhabitants of both cities generally
removed into the country; whereby business was suspended. We
returned hither the beginning of November. Congress assembled in
december, when the treaty 117 August 17971 between the United
States and Tunis was laid before the Senate, with the alterations in
the 11%12%and 14'Q articles to which you and Mr Cathcart agreed.
The Senate having given its advice and consent, the treaty has now
been duly ratified by the President. One of the originals received
from you is herewith returned, with the ratification in due form.
The other destined by you to be returned, will be sent by the next
safe conveyance. - A large ship is loading a t New York with naval
and military stores for Tunis; and the Agent informed me that she
will be ready to sail the first week in February. The residue of the
stipulated stores will be forwarded as fast as they can be provided:
but some are of a nature d S c u l t to procure, and it will take time to
furnish them. They are not articles which are to be found on hand,
like common merchandise, in our sea opt towns; the timber and
planks especially, being of prescribed L e n s i o n s , must be cut and
prepared for the particular service. However, that the Bey might
receive an evidence that the United States will fulfill their stipulations, the large ship above mentioned has been directed to be loaded
with such of the stores required as the City of New York could furnish; the lumber of dimensions as near as possible to those prescribed.
Until the SophiaJ$ arrival, nothing could be done: because i t was
hoped and ex ected that the Bey would consent to substitute money
for stores.
burthen of the latter is enormous. By a calculation
made of their bulk, it appears that they will probably occupy the
space of a t least fifteen thousand barrels. Regularly, none could
have been provided, until the treaty was finally ratified; and this
could not take place until the Senate assembled in december.
Under these circumstances, the Bey will see the impossibility of
sending forward the regalia of maritime and military stores within the
period which he proposed: and unless he is at all events determined to
make war upon us, he will wait such a length of time as will render the
providing and transporting of them practicable. He should also
consider the danger we run of capture by some of the belhgerent
powers; seeing the stores are contraband of war. From that cause
alone, half of them may miscarry.
Your letters of June l q t and 15@were received the lGth of October.
the latter strongly enforces the necessity of forwarding the stores
expeditiously: but it is hoped your apprehensions are too lively, that
war will be the consequence of some delay. A s the Bey would accept
no gt~bstitufefor the stores, he will hardly forfeit them by war rather
than wait a few months longer. I enclose a copy of C a p t W Brien's
list of stores, and of that which you forwarded. Comparing them,
you will see the latter to be materially more burthensome, by the addition of ten tons of cordage, and the greatly increased dimensions of the
planks and timber.

TE~

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS
The importance of sending a naval force into the Mediterranean, to
shew to the Barbary powers our capacity to defend our commerce,
and to annoy them, has repeatedly been urged; and probably the
period is near a t hand when this measure will be practicable. At the
same time its efficacy may be questioned. The Danes and Swedes
have long possessed a naval force vastly superior to what we can exhibit: yet the regencies have often broken their peace with them; and
after a display of frigates and some fighting (as in the case of the Danea
late1 with Tripoli) both of those nations have yielded to the humuliating Lmands of Algiers, Tunis and Tripoli. Whence this contempt of
those two maritime powers? Have these never been in earnest in
joining battle m t h the Corsairs? Or have they wanted spirit or conduct? - The late spirited example of Portugal, when a single ship
of the line destroyed two Tripolitan Corsairs and reduced the Bey to
the very novel condition of purchasing peace of a Christian Power is
encouraging; and should our dserences with France be settled by our
Envoys now a t Paris, and either of the Regencies break their peace
with us, our whole naval force may be sent against them: and consistsmaller ships, brigs and Schooners, no fleet would be
for service on the coast of Barbary: and by their
according to the enclosed list, you will see they
are sufficient to destroy the Corsairs of any one, or of all the three
regencies together. - For you know from the proofs given by
American seamen in our revolution war, that they are not sur awed
in skill and bravery by the seamen of any nation on earth. Anlaltho
it would be neither decent nor prudent for you to boast of our naval
force; yet if the Bey should unfortunately manifest a hostile temper
you can contrive without a direct communication from yourself,
unless he should enquire to let him know the extent and quality of the
naval force we can send into the Mediterranean. He knows and fears
the prowess of the English: and he may be informed that we are their
descendants ;and ship to ship and man to man, are in no thing inferior. Your expressions are, that the Bey requests a cruizer of 18 or 20
guns, and demands a present of jewels. Neither was stipulated or
expected by the United States. - The former we could certainly
furnish, because of our own manufacture. The jewels can only be
obtained in Europe - a t present in England - the amount
enormous.
Your details of the commerce of Tunis are interesting. It would
give employment to all her naval armament, if converted from corsairs
to merchant vessels. And is it not possible to give to a Prince so
enlightned as the present Bey, such ideas of the advantages of a
peaceful commerce as to induce him to attempt the change? Besides,
as the government is hereditary in his family, he will feel an interest
in it, which can have no operation in the military elective regencies.
I n his letter to the President, the Bey e resses his desire that a
solid and lucrative commerce ma be estab hed between us. Our
enterprising merchants would rea dy commence it, were the assured
of protection, and that monopolies of the exports of L s kmgdom
would not prevent their obtaining return car oes. If, for instance,
the 250,000 hides, which you state to be annua y exported by a company, with exclusive privileges, and which the subjects are compelled
to sell to them, a t eleven cents each (amount 27,500 dollars) were not
under a monopoly, they might be exchanged with American mer-

chants for commoditiesl pfobabl of the value of 250,000 dollars. Or

suppose they gave T m s ~ a sugjects

only 25 cents and the Bey 12%
cents for each hide, his subjects would receive $125,000, and his
revenue, instead of ten or fifteen thousand dollars, would on this single
article be increased to upwards of $60,000. - Are these monopohes
irrevocably fixed? It is not presumeable. And cannot a man of the
Bey's good sense, and so ea er after gain be easily e htened on the
subject; and will he not fee himself under strong and asting obligations to the Consul and nation who shall place him in a condition so
advantageous to himself and his subjects? If these ideas are not
the freedom with which he converses with you, will enable
you to close them.

express to you my thanks for the attentions shown to my deputies
Wdliam Eaton & James Leander Cathcart, who were charged to

With respect to the time within which you required that the stipulated stores should be delivered, I have charged Mr Eaton to explain

that of the six months proposed, four had elapsed when your letter

To Jamer Leander Cathcart, U. S. Conrul, Tripoli, from Secretary of State

DEPARTMENT
OF STATE

Philad' Jany 16'P 1800
SIR,By the Sophia, which arrived here the latter end of August, I
received your dispatches. Your negotiation with the Bey of Tripoli
has been conducted in a manner very satisfactory to the President.
The services of Doctor MQDonoghhave been so useful, I have written
him a letter (herewith transmitted) expressing the President's acknowledgements, approving the compensations made to him by you,
and bespeaking his future good offices, should any occasion call for
them.
It is not surprising that Tunis & Tripoli should feel hurt by any
claim of pre-eminence by &em: and from the indignant manner in
which they repel this claim, i t is manifestly impolitic to hold i t up to
view, even if i t exists - (a point at least doubtful -) because its
existence will operate its full effect in our favour, so long as i t shall be
known that we stand well with Algiers. And i t will not be &,
when a fair opportunity shall offer to intimate to the Bey of Tripoli,
that the United States are disposed to treat him with the like respect
and friendship as they do the Chiefs of the two other Regencies.
This seems to be what he expects by this expression in his letter to the
President - "We have consummated the peace, which shall on our
part be unalterable; provided you are willing to treat us as you do
the two other Regencies, without any difference being made between
us." The letter previously adverts to the &culties in the way of
your negotiation, and his resolution not to receive you: But that Dr
MqDonogh's entreaties prevailed; and so, in order to gratify his desire,
and to preserve unaltered the subsisting friendship, the Bey -reed to
accept the s m d sums of ten thousand dollars in lieu of the shpulated
stores, and eight thousand dollars as a substitute for the brig Sophia,
promised by Captain 0 Brien. - I should send you a copy of the
Bey's letter, it the answer of the Rais to you "that the Bey never gave
copies of his letters to any one," did not excite an apprehension that
if i t were laown, i t might give offence: and yet, without a formal
copy, i t seemed proper that you should be acquainted with the
substance of its contents.
Agreeably to your request, Mr Woodsides has received two hundred
dollars on your account, to procure you some supplies, which I expect
he will send in the ship Hero, now nearly loaded, and which is to sail
for Tunis the first week in February. * * * The Sophia carries
this letter: she is loaded with a valuable cargo of stores & merchandize
for Algiers. In the Spring other vessels mth ample c ow, to fulfil
our engagements with Alpers and Tunis will be forwar ed. - The
yellow fever has again visited Philadelphia & New-York, and obliged
the bulk of the inhabitants, as well as the pubhc offices to remove.
This retarded every measure to be taken relative to the states of
Barbary. We did not return 'till the beginning of Noyember.
The merchdize before mentioned, wth the quantxties yet to be
sent to Algiers, is destined to form an exchange for the monies borrowed there to defray the expenses of negotiatiqns with Tunis &
Tripoli, and for charges and obligations incurred m Algiers. It appesrs probable that some of our armed vessels will visit the
Mediterranean in the ensuing spring or summer. I inclose a list of

To Richard O'Brien, U. S. Consul General, Algiers, from Secretary of State

DEPARTMENT

Philad* Jan? 16&."1800
SIR, On the llthof July I received your dispatches by the Polacre
Dey, Captain Smith. Soon after, I desired Mr Humphreys and
another naval architect to examine the vessel, for the purpose of
putting her in tho order which you desired. They examined, and
reported their opinion that the expense of such alterations and repairs
would be much greater than the whole value of the vessel when
completed; and that she was not calculated for such an armed vessel
as you designed to make her. No other suitable vessel immediately
presented: and in August, the yellow fever again prevailing, ob ed
the inhabitants to flee to the country, and suspended business. %he
fever prevailed in like manner, and produced similar effects, in New
York. After this, there was a prospect that one of the public armed
ships, which was taken out of the service, would supply the place of
the Polacre; but upon further enquiry, this vessel also was deemed
inehgible: and the season being then far advanced, i t was concluded
to load the Sophia once more for A1 'ers; and she is now ready to sail,
with a valuable cargo, as by the inc osed invoice and bill of lading. As you mentioned that 500 barrels of powder must be sent, I directed
their being put on board: but the room left for them being insufficient,
only 360 have been shipped. And I think this not unfortunate; that
so necessary a commodity may not be wholly hazarded in a single
bottom. The residue will be shipped in the Spring, with the other
articles contained in your lists; except a few not to be found in the
United States; or not in the quantities required. - Of the spikes of
the specified dimensions, several tons are made, and the several
quantities will in due time be completed.
The delay which takes place in forwarding the stores and goods
you commissioned, wherewith to discharge our debts to the Jews,
will I trust produce no very great inconvenience: Every just claim,
every stipulation, will be provlded for by the shipment in the Spring.
The twenty brass twenty-four pound cannon desired by the Dey,
cannot be procured in the United States, nor probably elsewhere during the present war. But if iron guns of that size, and of the neatest
and best kind, will answer as a substitute, we can furnish them. Our
iron is of a su erior quality, and our founderies now very perfect. The
guns will be 'ght, as well as strong and smooth. If the 24 pounders
are wanted for gallies, they perhaps need not be more than seven feet
long, and weigh about thirty six hundred; perhaps less. By ad*
to
thew length, their weight will necessarily be increased: but if e q h t
feet and a half long, they need not exceed forty hundred weight:
whereas the usual weight of iron 24 pounders is 48 to 50 hundred.
In fact, for every kind of real service, in ships and garrisons, iron guns
of strong metal, and light, are, in the opinion of good judges, superior
to brass. I have said thus much to obviate the common prejudice in
favour of brass guns; seeing we have it not in our power to furnish
them. -

--

I inclose the copy of a paper delivered b Captain Cathcart, in
May 1796 to Mr Barlow, as exhibiting a list ofthe articles required by
the Dey of Algiers for our annuity of maritime and military stores.
But the quantities of the several articles are enormous; and instead of
twelve thousand sequins (21,600 dollars) would cost the United States
three or four times that sum. This was not contemplated when the
treaty with Algiers was ratified. I t is true, the treaty provides that
if the value of the stores annually delivered exceed the twelve thousand sequins, the surplus is to be paid for: But the prices of these
commodities, as estimated a t Algiers, bear no proportion to the sums
they cost the United States, and consequently any surplus adds to our
loss. - By your settlement in February last with the present Dey,
you got rid of the burthensome peace presents, and of the annuity for
two years and nine months: and it is hoped you will, a t least on the
arrival of the next cargo of goods and stores, be able to bring the
annual present within the bounds of moderation. Perhaps the list
inclosed, dictated by the former Dey in his wrath, may not be known
by his successor; or if known, be admitted to be unreasonable. I n
such an event, you will send a list of the reduced articles for the annuity, defining the sizes, as well as uantities, with great precision;
and adding the res ective prices a t giers. - Cutting the oak and
pine planks of one ength, breadth and thickness, wastes a great deal
of timber, and they make bad stowage in a vessel. As the Dey has
cruisers of various sizes, an assortment of planks, varying in all their
dimensions, would be better adapted to his service than the huge
planks hitherto re uired, and more practicable and less expensive for
is very true, if a plank 15 or 18 inches broad will
us to procure. be rated no higher than one of 12 inches, we had better cut off the
surplus timber, to lessen the freight. But as the Algerines allow a
better price for thick than thin planks, so may they distinguish between
broad and narrow ones.
I t would be convenient to receive from you a correct table of Algerine weights and measures compared with those of the United States.
I t is proper that you should know the history of the ship Hero,
which sailed hence more than a year ago laden with planks, masts and
naval stores for Algiers. - In a few days after her departure, springing a leak, she bore away for the West Indies, and arrived a t Jamaica,
where she was obliged to unload and repair. In the Spring, she sailed
thence to proceed on her original voyage: again became leaky; and
so put back to New-York. There she was again unloaded, and underwent a thorough repair. But in the autumn, when ready to load the
third time, i t was found that a great part of her lumber was ruined.
The large oak planks in particular were so decayed as to be fit only for
fuel: and on this account it is fortunate that she returned from Jamaica
to the United States. - This extraordinary circumstance must be
ascribed to the large quantity of the timber on board, shipped, much
of it, while full of sap, heating and fermenting for a time m the hot
climate of the West Indies.
The oak planks and some other parts of the timber being thus
damaged, or ruined, and other portions being, in consequence of your
settlement, no longer required for Algiers, while they would answer
well for our engagements with Tunis; it was judged best to complete
the Hero's cargo with additional lumber (such as could be found a t
New York nearest the requisite dimensions) and other suitable stores,

for Tunis. She is now nearly loaded; and the Agent informs me, will
be ready to sail the first week in February. - The residue of the
stores for Tunis w i l l be provided and shipped as soon as possible.
A plate has been cut for the new passports, such aa you recommended, of but about hdf the present breadth a t the head; and the
parts necessary for the Consuls will be forwarded in the Spring. One entire new passport is inclosed for our inspection. After a series of misfortunes, Mr oseph Donaldson arrived a t
Philadelphia. The ship and cargo with which he sailed from Leghorn,
was seized and condemned by the French a t Cayenne. He went to
Prtmce, hoping to recover the value; but was disappointed. I n the
last summer he sailed again for Europe, where he still is. When he
returns, the bills he drew on London m favor of the Jews, and which
you sent me, w i l l be presented, and payment obtained if practicable.

SIP, I have reserved for a separate letter the President's determination on the subject of the present of jewels demanded by the Bey of
Tunis. In his letter to the President, of which I inclose a copy, you
will see that he persists in his claim; but not in terms so deolsive as
in his conversations with you. Perhaps i t may yet be parried; or a t
least reduced to one half the amount. Since you wrote, you may
have ascertained what other powers, ae well as Spain, have g v e n on
similar occasions. I am aware that the delay is unfavourable: but if
he waits the arrival of the Hero, with her valuable cargo of n a v d and
military stores - an earnest besides that the residue will come - I
hope he will be softened; and that you will either do away this
claim, or reduce it to a small value, m some few of the most conspicuous articles in his list. - You will well consider how this &air
may be best conducted; and act as you shall think most advantageous
for the interest of the United States. I t will not do to bee ourpeace
with Tunis for the value of this present. You suppose the estrmate
to be extravagant: doubtless the articles are set a t the Jew prices;
and that for a much less sum they may be procured in England. If

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS

therefore you are com elled to give the present, secure time enough
to get them from Eng and. Some articles must probably be manufactured for the purpose; and the whole may require a year to be
procured. I n the mean time, as he wants something to be seen, a few
articles most showy may be provided a t Tunis. If he objects to the
proposed delay ;you can answer, that the President felt a confidence,
that, on further reflection upon all circumstances in relation to the
United States, he would relinquish the claim; and therefore did not
give orders to provide the Present.
I su pose the Bey understands French; and therefore, with a copy
of the resident's letter to him in English, I send you a French translation of it, to be presented or not as you judge proper.

DEARSIR, I have received your letters in a complete series as far

as N"0, dated the 14Q of November last, and none later.
Unless Portugal would permit a commercial intercourse with her
American Colony, the Brtlzils, a treaty would seem to be of no great
moment: and your communications clearly indicate that she will
avoid m treaty whatever. - The time however will rapidly advmce, w en she will thinli the United States entitled to more respect
than her conduct now supposes. - I trust the information to be
derived from the Chevalier de Freire will give that court juster ideas
of the importance of this country: and the statements of its own
minister will be duly appreciated.
I have informed you of the sailing of a large ship (the Hero) with a
valuable cargo for Tunis: She was detained a t New York a month
longer than I expected, sailing the beginning of February instead of
January. - The Sophia departed in January with a cargo of gunpowder and merchandize for Algiers, the latter to raise a small supply
of money. - The residue of the stores stipulated for Tunis are preparing to be shipped this Spring, and another vessel with goods &c.
will in about a month sail for Algiers. - I wrote fully to 0 Brien
and Eaton, explainin the causes of the delays which had taken place:
and I persuade myse f if the Hero and Sophia fortunately reach thew
destination, that all will be well. If however, 0 Brien shall have
renewed a pressing call for mon you will have answered his draughts
on the arrangements made by !&r King with the House of Baring, in
London, or Messre Bulkele 's in Lisbon, as you found one or the other
most advantageous. - f t will be desireable, considering the capricious characters of the Barbary Governments, that you should
always exercise your discretion in judging and acting upon thew demands, thro' our Consuls.
The expectation long since formed and so of+n repeated, of two of
?ur fr@ates visiting the European seas and entenng the Medterranean,
is agam disap ointed. - One stout frigate of 44 guns (the Philaddphia, Capt becatur Senior) now nearly ready for sea was destined
for that cruise, with another ship of the same size fitting a t Norfolk:
But the ConsteUution, Truxtun, m a severe en agement of five hours
with the French frigate V-eweance of 54 guns, ost his maimpast, and
wrqs otherwise so much damaged, as to be under the necessity (after
gomg down to Jamalca and not finding the requisite materials) of
returning home to refit: she may be daily expected. - This obliges
Decatur to sail for the Station left by Truxtun, to command the
cruisers in the vicinity of Guadaloupe. - And the Congress frigate,

require the Cheasapeak (the frigate a t Norfolk) to take her place. The Congretw (of the same force with the Constdatwn) was bound,
with the Essez frigate, to the East Indies, to protect our rich commerce in those seas.
I n about a week after their departure, early

two Negroes remained at the place where they ware sold, probably
from choice: - Captain Paddock and the seven others have been

continue to do, until1 their Redemption can be eEected. Neither Captain Paddock or Mr Court say whether the Arabs
had st the date of their letters, demanded any specific sum of money
for these unfortunate people, - from their silence on the subject I
should suppose not. - I t is indeed a very fortunate circumstance,
that so many of them have so speedily, been brought to a place
where they may be considered in safety, for whilst they remarn in

DEARSIR,I have felt much anxiety on account of the delays
which have taken place in the Barbary affairs: but nevertheless I
have reason to believe that all will be well. Letters from Consul
Eaton at Tunis to Feb? lo$received three or four days since, warrant
the expectation. - You wiIi be informed that the Sophia, with a
very valuable cargo, sailed in January [26] for Aleem, and a large
ship [Hero] with timber and naval stores for Tums in Februa
was assured she would be read to sail early in January. - By t ese
vessels I write fully to Cons s 0 Brien & Eaton. - Instead of a
common ship intended for Algiers this Spring, with merchanQze for
re-establishing our funds there, one of our frigates is getting ready to

take in timber and naval and military stores, as well as merchandize. This frigate was originally an East Indiaman, a burthensome vessel
of seven or eight hundred tons. She will of course leave on shore
some of her guns and men: but she will remain well armed and
manned. Her cargo will all be ready by the time she comes round
here from Newport, which will be in ten days or two weeks. Other timber, plank, naval and military stores are reparing for
Tunis, and will shortly be ready for loading. - The tim er and plank
were growing in the woods when we received the definitive arrangements, last autumn, with that regency.
You will have the goodness to communicate this information to
the Consuls Eaton & 0 Brien, by the earliest opportunities. - I
have given the like information, and made the same request to
Mr Smith.

DEPARTMENT
OF STATE
Philadelphia May 1800.
SIB, On the 12th instant were received your letters bearing date
Decr 27.30. & 31. & the first of January last.
Altho' i t would be very desirable that the Tripoline cruisers should
be restrained within the limits which you state, in respect to the boarding of American vessels to examine their passports - viz. that two
men only should enter the vessel; yet you have doubtless acted prudently in submitting to the alteration in your passport required by
Morad Raiz, altho' by the 9'p art,icle of our treaty our commerce is to
be on the footing of that of the most favoured nations - say the
British and Spanish, whose treaties contain that limitation. But
similar stipulations are constantly inserted in the treaties of the
Christian nations of Europe - and never observed by those which
are a t war.
The pretences on which, as you represent them, the Tripoline
cruisers capture and condemn the vessels and cargoes of nations with
which they are a t peace, demonstrate the extreme precariousness of
any existing treaty; and th&tnothing can give effectual and permanent
security to our commerce, but a marine force adequate to the destruction of those cruisers: and from your description of theu number and
qualities, any two of our frigates, with two smaller vessels, would
without, much difficulty, demolish their whole force. Should the
pending negociation with France produce peace between her and the
United States, it will be in the power of the U. States to send-bto the
Mediterranean a naval force sufficient to combat and destroy the
marine of all the Barbary Powers: and should the necessity of the
measure occur, it is to be hoped there will be no hesitation in doing it.
The efficacy and even economy of such a measure have been incontrovertibly proved by Commodore Campbell, with his single ship of the
line, in reducing the Bey of Tripoli to absolute submission; not only
to make peace, but, what is perhaps without example, to r c h e it of
a Christian Power - and that power possessing so sm a marine ss
Portugal.
The bills you mention that you had drawn payable to the order of
Captain Eaton, have never been presented here.

May 2rt@1800
SIRSince the dnte of the enclosed dispatch I heard nothing from the
Bashaw untill the evening of the 25" inst when Siddi Mohammed
Daguize sent me the original in arabic of which the enclosed is a literal
translation. The only conclusion which can be drawn from the
Bashaws proceedings is that he wants a present, & if he does not get
one, he will forge pretences to commit depredations on the property
of our fellow Citizens; His letter to the President will be the means of
keeping him quiet untill he receives an answer provided no unnecessary
delay is made, as he will expect to reap a benefit therefrom? should
government think roper to make him a present, i t will have the desired effect probab y for one year; but not longer, I therefore can see
no alternative but to station some of our Frigates in the Mediterranean, othenvise we will be continually subject to the same insults which
the Imperials Danes Sweeds & Ragusians have already suffer'd, & will
still continue to suffer, if they do not keep a sufficient Naval force in
this Sea to protect their trade; notwithstanding the Danes & Sweeds
have promis'd to pay this Regency fifteen thousand do1l"ench every
three years either in cash or Navd etores st the option of the BashawIt would no doubt be s desir&bleobject for government to be infom'd whether cash or stores would be most acceptable & what might
be the ammount of the Bsshaws expectations, but I think it would be

!
'

357

n very imprudent question for me to ask, lest he should extend them
beyond the probability of their being complied with, i t is therefore in
my opinion much better to let it remain as it is a t the option of the
President, for the truth is, both cash & stores by way of present,
would be equally acceptable for the value of which by conjecture I
refer you to my letter in Cypher.
Farfara informs me that the Bashaw expects to receive an answer
from the President himself, as he always receives the same token of
respect from the chiefs of eve Nation with whom he corresponds?
he likewise has hinted that d ' t o he had i t not in his power to be of
any service to the United States on my arrival at Tripoli, that he
has i t now, & will always use his influence in favor of the United
States, the fact is he has i t in his power to do us much harm, & it is
prudent to be on the best terms with him, for which flfaut l'argent.
I have filed the original letter from the B a b w in this office in

immediately within my sphere Yesterday I red letters from Mr Cathcart dated 25. & 27" May
intimating tl demand made on the U States by the Pacha of Tripoli
for a Regalia equivdent to that of the Bey of Tunis; and accompanying n letter for the department of State, which, it is presumed, contams the demand alluded to.
If further testimony be necessary to inforce n conviction of the
correctness of the conclusion, so often reiterated, that no profusion
of generosity can satisfy these begging thieves we shall. undoubtedly
have that testimony - The Bey of Tunis holds to hw claim for a
m i s e r - I refused to commurucate his message - He gave me
to understand that I would be ordered out of his kingdom - I
intimated to him in return my sense of the Honor he would do me

by such a measure
I will not yield to the claim. Let him send
me away - He dare not make war upon us if the U States use

their proper means to deter him. Without the use of these means
we are considered tributaries - and shall be treated as such Again, I say, our affairs in Barbary have been badly managed Our negotiators have been French Agents, Apostate Amerieaw and
Slam! I dont mean a criminal reflection by this last term - I
have seen a man who exhibited no extraordinmy symptoms of fear
in moving to a battle n-ho trembled in passing a grave yard for fear
of ghosts - & I have seen a man, who, I believe, would not shrink
a t the thunder of a Broadside of a man of war, tremble at the Nod of
a Turban - In the first instance the impressions were made by the
Nurse - In the latter by the Basfinado & chains - All of us,
who have seen Barbary, agree in this point That nothing bzll terror
d l check the insolewe of these demands on our generosity! What has
been done to effect it? What is doing to effect it? Nobody here,
acquainted with our concessions, could be persuaded that we are the
same Americans who, twenty years ago, braved the resentment of
Great Britain, if that fact were not recorded. There is, indeed, no
nation so much humiliated in matt.ers of tribute -And i t is a burlesque
upon every thing manly or political to see nations pouring into the
ports of these kingdoms, which have not of their own produce a single
article of naval material, stores and builders to construct navies to be
employed as pirates against themselves - In this list of hlconsentents
the U States at present have the honor to stand a t the head - Our
whole system of Negociatim must be changed - There is no devinstion in this prediction: But it will be found as true as divinity P d o n , I pray you, Sir, this rhapsody - No American can be cool
and suffer as I do - And say to the Govt of the U. States they must
either send a show of force to the Tunis - or a Slave!
The example of Portugal a t Tripoli, is it not worthy of imitation!

Consul Cathcart is undoubt[ed]ly correct when he states that two of
our Frigates and four of our Gun boats would bring the Bashaw of
Tripolia to terms, but the propriety of his opinion that it would be
best to make him a voluntary present may be questioned if Malta
should revert to its ancient form of Government, what would it avail
us what benefit have we ever experienced from its Constitutional
hatred to Musselmen
Genoa has received a new master sufficiently majesterial i t is
presumed to protect her from Barbary insolence this deprives them
of another considerable resource, all their Booty in the mediteranian is
falling into custody of abler freebooters, the must take it then in
foreign markets it IS not less the interest of a commercial Europe to
point them to america than it is theirs to take that direction, we must
either bribe their avarice or chastise their audacity, veing only
increases their avidity for more we have then the only a ternative to

yield unconditional accord to their elaims or sbrengthen ourselves up
a little and look them out of Countenance, this position a t some period
must be taken, does the present moment forbid it or shall we wait a
little lo er till we have reinforced their navy by our naval and military rega 'a until1 they become formidable to us, when we are unlading
those regalias in their harbours are we not shedding the Blood of our
Countrymen, it is devoutly hoped that the U. S may have the honour,
very easil obtained of setting the first example amongst the tributaries of cTtastizeing the insolence of those lords. If Tripolia persists does not Tripolia invite the experiment and is
not the occasion a good one shew him two or three of our strongest
best built Frigates set life and death before him leave to him the choice,
if he prefers the later give it him, there is nothing impracticable in
the thing the turks are a contemptiable military and at sea lubbem, I
have by accident been three days and two nights in one of their
corsairs a t sea our seamen of the north may give them cent per cent
in numbers odds and meet them on any Ground of war - barely
except boarding. - I t would be well on their return or passage out
that the Frigates visit Tunis I will invite the Sapatapa and a brace
of the Be s Governors to dine in the Commodore, I will point to his
Guns an say see there our execdive power Commissioned to Keep
treaties do these sentiments look hostile they are the only sure
Guarentee of Peace, all rational nature may be adduced to evidence
it, and France besides, it is more strikeingly true in a country where
all respect is denied to every thing but arms. - Consistently with
those sentiments, Therefore the Questions submitted by Consul
Catchart to the Consul Geni OBrian and on which the Opinion of
this Consulate is demanded have received the following answers. QUESTION
I'! Wheather it would not be the Interest of the United
States to make the Bashaw a present to content him at least till
some of our Frigates come into the Mediteranian if in the W a t i v e
to what amount ought the present be made, that is supposing there is
no alternative. ANSWER I should not have intruded my Counsel in any matters
relative to your administration had you not desired it. - The Bashaw of Tripolia has given written documents as evidence of his entire
satisfaction in the presents he has received from the United States as
the condition of a perpetual Peace
Whence then arrises his claims i t is not su%cient that he asserts
a right to be placed on a footing with the other regencies, he may be
Informed that i t is owing to the treachery of french agents, that the
latter have been so liberally paid were this otherwise his claim is
nevertheless inadmissiable being barred by his own Voluntary act, a
Demand therefore of this Last is a t least an infringement upon the
Treatie.
But i t is to be doubted, wheather any extention of the Presidents
Instructions may be construed to a discretion of giveing or even
stipulating additional presents it is a latitude which seems not to
have been intended even in Cases more Imperious than the present it
is a happy Circumstance for us and ought to satisfy the Bashaw that
we are thus Circumscribed - that the Bashaw has condecended to
beg a present will not Warrant us the discretion of giveing To revert to your figure to Captain OBrian that we are sentinah of
an advanced Plquet it is our duty to give an alarm on an Enemies

approach, but by no means to concede one inch of ground which we
are stationed to defend from these premises my opinion may be easily
infered that the Bashaw of Tripola must wait the Answer of the
President of the United States to his demands. and my opinion also
be as easiIy infered that the President will highly approve of your
Conduct in the mode you have adopted to resist or a t least to delay
his claims until1 such answers be received [QUESTIOK]

any of our Vessels be sent in here on any
pretence whatever and their Cargoes condemned how would you
advise me to act after such a violation of our treatie, shall I refuse the
Corsairs of Tripola america Passports or shall I issue them as if
Nothing had happened [ANSWER]Should any eveut of this Kind happen which does not
from any thing to be geathered from your Communications seem
immediately to menace us impelious Circumstances must be yielded
to and the possible provision made for the crews untill the result of
the Government be Known but passports being evidence of the good
understarnding subsisting between the Government of the United
States and the Bashaw of Tripola cannot in truth nor propriety be
granted after that good understanding shall be interrupted besides
thk concession would furnish the Enemie a decoy t o entrap our
Merchantmen and even our Vessels of War a t the same time that it
would shield the Corsairs against reprisals from our ships of war which
might be detacthed on this very duty.
Pasports therefore cannot be given or granted after an overact of
infraction of the Treatie on the part of the Bashaw of Tripolia or his
subjects [QUESTION]
3r.ddo you immagine that the Dey of algiers would send
four or five of his corsairs to demand any american Vessels that might
be captured, and if he would would it not cost the United States more
to fee him than to content the Basham of Tripoh
[ANSWER]
I am of opinion that if the Dey of Algiers would take the
above step that he would succeed but all the letters in the world would
a t most produce only an evil answer mixed with lies and absu~dities If
the United States must see an advocate with his Excellency the
Basbaw of Tripolia and my advice were to infiuence their choice they
would prefer a jrench man to an algerine or a J e w If Joseph Bashaw
the son of a li Bashaw choose to proceed to outrage the President of
the United States, and not Patroon Grandi is to be resorted to for
measures of Indemnity. no doubt redress would be as shure or
secure at his suit as that of our good friend the Dey of algiers the

I am honored with your letter of the 21 ins, advising of the arrival

This Vessel is to go to Algiers with a Cargo - but not a full cargo,
for she may have an opportunity of performing other Service, besides
cclrr ing a Cargo to Algiers, But if she was to take a full crew, there
woufd be no room for any thing on board, except the men, & the
necessary provisions - You must therefore make arrangements for
encreasing the present crew, to just 130 Persons, including the commander and every soul on board - You must cause an estimate to
be made of the Provisions necessary for 130 souls for six months and apply to Cap$ Gill for the difference between that quantity, &
what you have already on board. If he has not enough of any particular article on hand - he must apply to George Harrison Esqr Navy
Agent, who will procure the deficiency. I t must be understood, that
you are to leave Port with this quantity, and of course, you must
before sailing re lace what mny be consumed in Port. To prevent
confusion, i t w d be best at once to apply for 7 months supply of
every thing but Salt meat - the men should be fed on fresh whde they
remain in Port - & Ms Harrison will take arrangements for having
them so supplied.

as soon aa possible - This is a bad season to remain a t Phila? & I

If you are not detained for the cargo, I shall expect you will be ready
to sail in one Fortnight a t latest from the receipt of this.
You seem to have so many Seamen, Landsmen & Boys, that you
will want few or no Marines. I presume i t will be best to make up
your deficiency of men, with able seamen; but remember, that you
are only to have 130 souls on board

OF STATE
Washington July 24th 1800

SIR,The duplicate of your K*160 and the first of 161 and 162 were
received on the 29q of June
The proposition made by the minister of Sweden for employing in
the Mediterranean a number of frigates, in concert between the
United States, Sweden and Denmark for the purpose of protecting
their commerce, has been laid before the President.
He is far from being pleased with the state of our affairs with the
Barbary powers; but he conceives that the engagements of the United
States, tho' unreasonab1 burthensome, ought to be performed. He
is not satisfied that in t i e existing state of those engagements, good
faith will permit us to unite with other powers, in appointmg, in concert
with them, convoys for their and our trade. There is indeed cause to
apprehend that the Barbary powers or so* of them, will break their
treaties with us, and recommence hostilitm on our commerce. In
such an event the United States will be a t perfect libert , and will be
well disposed, to make any reasonable arrangements wit Sweden and
Denmark for the purposes mentioned in the note of the Swedish
Minister.

Untll the differences between the United States and fiance shall be
so far accommodated as that actual hostilities shall cease between
them, to station American frigates in the Mediterranean would be a
hazard, to which our infant navy ought not perhaps to be exposed.

SIB, The George Washington sails immediately for Algiers with a
cargo according to the invoice a n Q i l l of lading inclosed. The cargo
I hope will reach you in good order and in time for the purposes of our
government .
The Sophia Capt Smith has arrived and has brought letters from
yourself and from Consul Eaton. Another vessel for the Mediterranean will I hope sail in a short time with such further articles as
may be necessary.
I find it diflicult from the papers in this department to ascertain
the precise state of our accounts uith the Barb
powers. I shall be
much obliged to you and to Consuls Eaton & athcart to make out
a perfect and complete stabment if you have it in your power to do
so, showing the claims of the different regencies and the produce and
application of every cargo which has arrived, and exhibiting also with
precision the present state of their demands.
I t is very much to be wished that a sum in specie could be fixed on
for the annuities instead of the specific articles now called for. It
would simplify the accounts and greatly ease the United States. The
sum of thrrty thousand dollars which you mention, would certainly
be more desrreable than the present annuity to Algiers. It is very
much the wish of our government to preserve its peace with the
Mediterranean powers and to perform all its engagements but the
burthensome caprices of the Barbary Sovereigns cannot always be
submitted to. I t will very much tend to secure the preservation of
peace and the punctuality of the payment to commute the annuity
to a sum in specie.
I will mention to the President who is now in Mtwsachusetts the
proposition for sending to Algiers a man to make powder.
I am Sir,&c kc.

SIR! You will receive herewith a Pass port from the Set? of State -a

and a letter from the Secretary o State to Rich* O'Brien, Consul
General of the United States, at Algiers.

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1785 TO 1801

You will proceed with the @ Washington, without delay, to Algiers - where you will deliver the cargo taken on board a t Phila*, to
the order of Rich$ OBrien, the Consul General.
I t may be proper for you to touch a t Gibraltar, Tangiers or C/ad'nto learn whether any of the Barbary powers, are committing hostilities
against the Vessels of the U: States. This is not expected to be the
case, but i t is possible, and by being informed, you will be guarded.
Should i t be the case, i t will become your duty to give to American
Vessels, & Citizens, all the protection in your power, on your passage
to Algiers as well as on your return - but your cargo belng valuable,
it will be proper that you should not go much out of your way, until
that is delivered. The Dey of Algiers, no doubt continues Friendly
to the U States.
You should on your arrival before Algiers, send an Officer on shore
with the letter to M: OBrien, whose advice you will follow on the subject of saluting the city, and every other matter, not degrading to
yourself, or the flag of the U: States. By our Treaty with Algiers, they are to salute our Vessels of war
with 22 guns, which is to be returned with the same number of Guns.
I t is said to be a custom, to give them a barrel of Common Powder for
every gun they lire. M' OBrien, can inform you, on this subject.
It might be well for you to receive from the Delaware a t New CastEle,
22 barrels Powder, for this purpose, in case they should be required.
If you can see Cap: Smith of the Brig Sophia, he will be able to
give you useful information respecting Algiers.
While you lay before that city, keep up the strictest discipline, &
the most Warlike appearance to make the best impressions of our
discipline & power - and try to keep up a good understanding between
the Citizens and your Officers & Crew.
The danger of the Plague & other reasons, however, should induce
you to get away from that place, as soon as possible - You will learn
in the Mediterranean whether on your return, it is Peace or War,
between America & France, & act accordingly - Your crew is too
small to admit of your remaining in the Mediterranean -after passing
Gibraltar, direct your course for N. York, you will arrive a t a season
when you can not get to Phila+;but if the War continues with France,
which you must presume, if you do not hear, from good authority,
the Contrary! you may spend as much time as your Provisions d l
admit, in cmsmg about Cayenne, Curricoa & the Havanna Lest you should not have the General Instructions, for your conduct on a cruise - they are now enclosed - also an act respecting the
Slave Trade, the object being to annihilate that Trade, & an act,
respecting Salvage.

SIR At the hour of departure, of our Post Boat for Tariffa, I
receive by Express from Mogodore, advice of Capt Paddock and
five of the Seamen of the Oswego, having sailed from that Port for
Lisbon on the 2@Ins; - one Man was left because he was ill of a
Fever & Ague; the other being an Irishman, declined accompanying
Captq Paddock; and put himself under protection of the Britlsh Vice
Consul a t Mogodore. - With this I have the honour to transmit
the Account MessrWourt & C-end mo of their disbursements on
this occasion up to the 2'J Inst, amounting to one thousand three
hundred twenty two dollars & three tenths, comprehending passage
money & provisions, calculated to be sufficient for the Voyage, and
during the Quarant.ine a t Lisbon. - These charges run high, but
such is the case with all matters, especially of a Public Nature, happening in this Country. I have still more & more to regret, that all the Crew of the Oswego,
did not reach Mogodore a t the same time; of the four who remained
a t the wreck, we have only yet heard of one, - John Hill, - who (by
a letter from himself) appears unfortunately to have fallen into the
hands of a Jew a t Illea, a Town considerably beyond the limits of
Muley Solimans acknowledged Sovereignty, who demands one hundred and sixty dollars being paid there for his release, which cannot
be complied with, for there can be no security of the mone reaching,

ships these people are doubtless exposed to, but I am equaly well
persuaded that yielding to exhorbitant terms of redemption readily,
IS but to expose us to endless encreased demands; and that every
Christian falling in the power of those rapacious wretches a t a future
time, would experience additional cruel treatment, and certain detention, with the view of enhancing the sum of their redemption. I have much satisfaction in acquainting you that the P l v u e since

SIR, The Anna Maria sails immediately for Tunis with a cargo
which I hope will reach you in good order. I send you a co y of the
invoice, bill of lading and charter party. Your letters by r Shaw
and by the Hero have been received. The President has, but with
very much reluctance consented to direct the purchase of the jewels.
The exorbitant and unwarrantable demands of the Barbary powers sit
very uneasy on us and are submitted to with difficulty. For the jewels
merely we are unwilling to go to war, and thus lose the benefit of the
heavy expenses already incurred. But this system of heavy exaction
must not be continued. You must persevere in your endeavours so
long as you may safely do so, to avoid entirely or diminish this demand.
I t may be that Mr [Rufus] King may find more difliculty or delay in
obtaining the jewels, and on that account as well as others i t is probably most adviseable to suspend any actual promise on this subject
as long as possible.
The residue of the stores will be prepared and expedited as soon as
can be done.

Government of the United States does not send said Bashaw of
Tripolia a present before March next that the Corsairs of Tripolia will
have orders to send in all The americans the[y] meet and a pretence
will not be wanting to Condemn Vessels and Cargoes The minister of tho marines of Algiers declared to me a few day4

observed to the dey that. you the Captain or I the Consul had no o r d m

demand. that without the orders of the U S. we could not do any
such thing. that we haveing no orders we could make no responsibility that. you could not. protect his property against the Portugeese
or Neapolitans. that your orders was to return to the United States
and you could only defend your ship against french Corsairs - agreeable to the orders of your government. That. the dey did not seem
satisfy'd with these explanations That shortly after I repeated nearly
The Same objections on this business. to the Algerine Prime minister
On the 26''' Ultimo The dey sent for me and the British Consul. and
asked me if I was still determined. not to acquise in Makeing responsibility & Carrying his Ambasador & Presents. I again repeated. all
the arguments. which I made Use of on the 18''' Ultimo & added as
this Vessel was a government One $9 we haveing no fixed Peace or
treatie with the Italian States or with The Grand Signior that this
Ship of the U S & Crew would. be in a Very singular Prediciament. in
going to Constantionople on the business. of the Regency we haveing
no Ambasador or Consul at these places. The dey Ans* Pasionatly
that these were all excuses that other nations had rendered Algiers the
like favours. but that if The British Consul. would promise faithfully
that a British Ship of war would come and go to the levant on this
Mission That under this Consideration he would. let the american
Ship return to her Count . The British Consul John Falcons Esqr
promised and assured the ey. in My presence that as Lord Keith had
promised to Send a ship of war on this business that. said Ship might
be daily expected. The dey observed he would wait A few dayes.
before he would fully determine. to See if The British Ship would
anive The dey. remained undetermined until the 3q ins: when
arrived at Algiers from Mahon a British Ship of war of 24 Guns. Sent
by the orders of Lord Keith intentionally to Carry the ambassdor
and presents of Algiers to Constantionople - This business Seemed
finished & Setled. in order that the British Shi of war would proceed
on the business. but from the 4''' ins5 to this ate. The dey Ministry
& Sundry Persons of influence. started Many difliculties relative to
the Mission of the regency going in the British Ship and finally
Objected. to go - when this Morning the dey Came to town from hls
Country Seat, and at. 10 A M Sent for me. and told me without Any
alternative. That the U S Ship Should do him The favour to Carry his
Ambasador & presents to Constantionople. that if this favour or
demand was not Complyed with, that he no longer holds to his friendship with the united States, On My declareing that the[y] I or the
Captain of The U S. Ship had no orders. and Could not Justify, ourselves to our government to, acquise. The dey got Very angry and
declared that. he considered every thing we did say or Could say - to
be excuses. not to do him The favour he required - and that if This
favour was not acquised to. he Knew. what to do. that other nations
frequently did it. and he Could see no reason or Motive which should
prevent me, on the part of the United States acquiseing to This
request, I again repeated to the dey that I, or the Captain could make
no responsibility on the part of the U S - That we Could not think
his property Safe under the American flag from. The Capture of his
Enemies - That the Ship Sailed DzlU or heavy - that it was war
time. a thousand Wculties would happen. The dey hastily observed
that Qbd was great. That. all was on his head. that all diilticulties
would be surmounted. I again declared that. I or the Captain had no
orders. which would in any respects Justify ourselves. to acquise -

The dey said he would Justify Us & that the Ship Should go perforce,

rejected the British ship - And that On this account. he would
insist that this request should. be acquised to The dey said he would send his Bag to the marine to be hoisted a t

sorrow on account of his determination & withdrew - went and
explained to the prime Minister all that had pased or was said on this

that the deyg mind was so positively fixed & determined on this affair
that there would be no alternative but to Comply - to prevent

Main. that. said ship agreeable to our laws was out of Commission
and would not be Considered as a Public Ship of the U S - that the

To Secretary of the Bavy from Captain William Bainbridge, U. S. Navy

ALGIERS,
10th Oct. 1800.
SIR, I wrote you on the 25th ult. informing that the arbitrary
Dey of Algiers had made a demand, that the United States ship
George Washington under my command, should carry his presents to
the Grand Signior at Constantino le.
By my letter of the 25th you d s e e the responsibility this Regency
considers the United States at on this embassy, although forced into
it by the power of the Regency. Every effort that was possible to
suggest, has been attempted by Consul O'Brien and myself to obviate
my going.
An English ship of war arrived here and offered to ca
the embassy ; but her they wollld not accept, supposing they woul be under
some obligations to the British.
The light that this Regency looks on the United States is exactly
this: you pay me tribute, by that you become my slaves, and them
I have a right to order as I please. Did the United States know the
easy access of this barbarous coast called Barba , the weakness of
thelr garrisons, and the effeminacy of their peop e, I am sure they
would not be long tributary to so pitiful a race of infidels.
Inclosed you have the letter of Richard O'Brien, Esq. Consul
General, of the 9th of October, to me on the business of this embassy;

"B

7

WARS WITH BARBARY POWEES

379

my answer, and fiis reply, by which you will see that I have no choice
in acting, but am governed by the tyrosts here.
Consul O'Brien and myself had a very warm dispute with the Dey
and Minister of Marine, (which was very near causing a declaration
of war) respecting hoisting the mission flag; the Consul and myself
insisted that if the Dev forced us to go, to wear our own flags, or if i t
was meant as a compliment to the Minister of Marine to hoist it a t
the fore-topmast head; but no arguments would avail, their despotic
will must be complied with: the Minister of Marine, came on board
with his admiral, and several Algerine captains, who went into the
main-top, and hauled down the American pennant, and hoisted
the Algerine mission flag.
Had we 10 or 12 frigates and sloops in those seas, I am well convinced in my own mind that we should not experience those mortifying degradations that must be cutting to every American who possesses
an independent spirit.
This forced crulse compelled by the Dey, will cost 14 or 16 thor~sand
dollars in expenses for pay and provisions, and after effected will
have no tendency to promote the interest of the United States with
this Regency; it is not in the nature of those people to regard any
favors done to them by a Christian nation.
I hope Sir, you will consider the very unpieasant situation that I
was fixed in, having no alternative but compliance or war,-the fears
of slavery for myself and 131 under my command, was the least
alarming to me; but a valuable commerce in those seas, that would
fall a sacrifice to the pirates of this port on account of our not having
cruisers ad'rrcent to protect it.
I sincerdy hope on my return from the Levant that I shall see some
of our frigates off Algiers; it is my candid opinion that in no part of
the world there is more need to shew them than in the Mediterranean
sea.
It is the opinion of Consul O'Brien, should any accident happen to
the Washington, against the interest of Algiers, by whatever cause it
may be, the Algerine cruisers will immediately capture our vessels,
unless they are prevented by our cruisers being in these seas. I
candidly believe, on the safety of the embassy in the ship under my
command, hangs the preservation of our peace with Barbary.

SIR I have Stated to you a narrative of facts. relative to the dey
and regency demanding. perforce that The U S. Ship George Washingbm
under your Command in the port. (and in the power. of a faahless
people) - Should proceed to Constantionople with the Ambasador
and presents of This regency and return to Algiers.
The Consequence of a positive rqfissal would be war made immediatly
by This regency on the United States. the S h p under your Command
would be detained. and detention & Slavery would be the fate of
yourself officers and crew The Vessels property and Citizens of The
united States would be Captured & Condemned in this City of bondage. The innocent would Suffer - not for the guilty, but for those
that had no orders to Act to preveni this Calamity. but of Viewing
The evih Chuse the least. by acquising to the forced demand by Sir
proceeding with the ship under your Command to Constantionople
with the Ambasador & presents of Algiers. & returning. you will
first extricate yourself officers Crew and ship of [from] Algiers. you
will by This Means Save the Peace of The United States. it is what
all other nations at peace with this regency. has done a t times as s
favour to Algiers. and is what Occasionally must be done by those
that intends to keep theire Pence. i t is Customary & Circumstanced
as the United States is, at resent. in Arrears. in debt no funds $9 in
fact no Credit. there is no afternative in My opinion but to Acquise and, in So doing, I am convinced you are (considering d difficulties)
acting for the best. for the present interests of the United States
I shall observe to you Sir that. The U S. made theire peace in Sept.
1795 - that The Regency got impatient on acct of the Cash stipulations not comeing forward a t this time Mr Bmlow & Donddson
thought proper without orders to Stipulate a 34 Gun frigate to preserve our affairs. The government of The U S ap roved their
e U S. had
Conduct and made good The stipulation. a t this time
not paid the Cash for the peace. or had not Sent f o n d The Stores
Stipulated, it is true our Citizens 100 were as yet in Algiers but the
number is greater a t present in the power of a despotic government
bound by no treatie or equity. dumb to reason and fully deterrmned
to renounce his friendship with the United States under all these
Circumstances. and evils which should happen in Case of a positive
refusal to the demand of the dey & Regency I have to demand of you
in the name of The U S, that you will consider thespurport of this
letter. and I think you will see the necessity of acqulseing to do-the
forced favour required of you & hCby The dey & regency of Algiers.

CHARLES
LEE Esq?
Secretary of State Protempore
SIRGive me leave to inform you that on the 15'5 ins* arrived a
Tripline Cruiser of 18 Guns commanded by Raiz Amor Shelli in
company with the brig Catharine James Carpenter Master belonging
to Minturn & Champlin of & from New York with a cargo of Sugar
Coffee Pimento Beef Whalebone & Logwood valued at 50,000 dollars
bound to Leghorn which was clear'd the same day after a great deal
of trouble &z had permission to sail the first fair wind - On the
evening of the same day Ciddi Mohammed Daguize who a t present
acts as Minister of Forelgn Affairs, sent for me, and inform'd me that
the Bashaw desired him to let me know that he had deliver'd up this
vessel & cargo in consequence of his having wrote to the President of
the United States that he would wait his answer before he would take
any measures whatever against the U S as he was in great expectation that the President would prefer giving h i a sti ulated sum
annually to making him arbitrary resents which probab y would not
content him & the President wo d not be able to determine what
sum would be necessary to maintain our Peace - I answer'd that
the Bashaw having now a valuable prize within his grasp was in my
opinion a very improper tima for Negotiation as an Agent leas acquainted with the Barbary States would probably be intimidated to
act in a manner very unjustifiable & to make agreements which would
never be rhtified by the government under whom he acts; that nevertheless I found it my duty to request him to inform the Bashaw, that
if be had form'd the most distant ides that ever the government of
the U S would pay him an annuity he might erase i t from his memory,
for that not only the President & government of the U S but the meanest of our Citizens would expend their last dollar and lose their last
drop of blood before they would consent to become tributary to the
Regency of Tripoli; That I would wait upon his Excel? in the morning & inform him verbally what I had now requested him to communicate in my name; we discoursed for above two hours during
which time the purport of my dispatches of lwt May was discuss'd
and produced the same effect as I absolutely refused to enter into any
negoclation whatever untill I receiv'd the Presidents answer to the
Bashaws letter accompanied with fresh instructions On the 16thI waited on the Bashawnincompany with Capt"arpenter to demand satisfaction for the Insult our flag had suffer'd in
having one of our vessels brought in here without any visible cause
her papers & passport being in perfect order & likewise to demand
restitution of property plunder'd from the brig, "The Bashaw answer'd
that he had not given any orders to th.6 Raiz. to bring @ American
vessels that he had broke him & disrmss'd hun from his service &
then gave orders to the Minister of the Marine to have overy arficle
that was plunder'd from the Brig return'd -

P

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS
The Bashaw then commenced thus! Consul their is no Nation I
wish lpore to be a t Peace with than yours: but all Nations pay me &
so must the Americans; I answer'd we have already paid you all we
owe you & are nothing in arrears, He answerd that for the Peace we
had paid him it was true, but to maintain the Peace we had given
him nothing, I obse1-v'd trhat the terms of our Treaty were to pay
him the stipulated stores cash &t in full of all demands for ever BE
then repeated nearly to the same effect as is contain'd in my dispatch
of the 12''' of M a y which to avoid repition I forbear inserting The Bashaw then observ'd that we had given a great deal to Algiers
& Tunis & that the Portu uese Captain had inform'd him that when
he pass'd Algiers the midd e of last month that he had seen an American Frigate m the Bay which he supposed had brought more presents
to the Dey; why do they ne lect me in their donations, let them give
me a stipulated sum annua y & I will be reasonable as to the ammount - In answer to the first I replied that it was true that one
of our Frigates was a t Algiers being one of a Squadron of three 44
Gun ships & some smaller vessels which were appointed to protect
our commerce in the Mediterranean, but whether they had presents
on board for the Regency of Algiers or not I could not inform him,
that some of them would have been a t Tripoli before now had I nof
inform'd them that they had better stay away untill the spring
upon acct of the badness of this road which renders i t very unsafe
a t this season" And in answer to his proposal of an annuity I replied
with some warmth exactly what I had requested Daguize to inform
him of in my name yesterday evening - Well then replied the
Bashaw let your government give me a sum of money & I will be
content - but paid I will be one way or other, "I now desire you to
inform your government that I will wait Six months for an Answer
to my letter to the President, that if i t does not arrive in that period
and ~f i t was not satisfactory if i t did arrive "tbat I will declare war
in form against the United States, inform your government said
he how I have serv'd the Sweeds who concluded their treaty since
yours let them know that the French English & Spanish have always
sent me presents from time to time to preserve their Peace & that
if they do not do the same I will order my Cruisers to bring their vessels
in whenever they can find them, he then turn'd to Daguize and told
him to explain to Captcq Carpenter what he had inform'd me (they
both speaking french) and added that he did not wish to make it a
private affair between the Consul and him and desired him to make
it publick as be wish'd the whole world to know it. He then told
Daguize to tell the Ca
that he hoped the United States would
neglect him as six or ei&t vessels of the value of his would ammount
to a much larger sum than ever he expected to get from the United
States for remaining a t Peace; besides says he I have a great desire
to have some Captains like you here to learn me to speak english I answer'd that it was absolutely impossible for to receive answers
to the letters which he desired me to write by CapQ Carpenter in six
months as it would be nearly that time before he would get home
upon acct of the winter Season & tbat I expected his Excellency
would wait untill the answers arrived let that period be long or short
& observ'd that none but those who held a correspondence with the
devil could determine whether he would be content with the Presidents
answer or not as neither the President nor myself knew what would
content him I therefore requested him to inform me explicitly what

7

B

was his expectations To the first he answer'd I will not only wait
for answers from your President but I will now detain the Brig &
write to him again; but I expect when he sends his answers that the[y]
will be such as will empower you to conclude with me immediately if
they are not I will capture your vessels - And as you have frequently inform'd me that your instructions does not authorize you
to give me a dollar I will therefore not inform you what I expect
untdl you are empower'd to negociate with me; but you may inform
your President that if he is disposed to pay me for my friendship I
will be moderate in my demands.
The Bashaw then rose from his seat & went out of the room leaving
me to make what comment I thought proper upon his extraordinary
conduct.
On the 17" Ciddi Mohammed Daguize sent for me & inform'd
me that the Bashaw had changed his mind & will not write to the
President as he says he has wrote already and that i t is not compatible
with his honor & dignity (which the Lord confound) to write again
before he receiv's an answer to his last The Brig having arted one of her cables in a gale of wind I had a
great deal of troub e to procure her an Anchor in the height of the
gale I was obliged to carry i t on board myself a t nine oClock a t night
and being very anxious for her departure will only take time to
observe that if the Presidents answer t.o the Bashaw and my instructions are not accompanied by two of our largest Frigates I probably
may be reduced to the humibating necessity of agreeing to terms vfry
repugnant to my feelings in order to prevent our Citizens from belng
brought into a captivity the horrors of which is easier to imagine
than describe If on the contra.ry a force sufficient is sent to enable us to act
with energy and to repel the Bashaws unjust claims with the indignation they merit our flag will in future be as much respected as the
British & French are if not we will be continually exposed to the
unwarrantable depredations of these Pirates whose insolence is incorrigible & who values existing treaty's no longer than the[y] are subservient to their interests This is the period that our national character ought to be establish'd with t h s Regency a well timed energy will without doubt
intimidate both the rest Bashaw & his successors from daring to
insult our Flag -whge too gre8t.a condescension will seem to indicate
that he may commit depredat~onsupon our commerce with impunity Whatever manner the wisdom of government adopts to settle this
affair i t is absolutely necessary to make the greatest dispatch & I

SALEM,
Dec. 11.
On Thursday arrived a t this port, the shi Brutw, William Brown,
commander, in 34 days from Gibraltm, and orty from Algiers. Cspt.
Brown informs - that the United States frigate George Washington,
capt. Bainbridge, sailed for Constantinople the 19th October, having
on board the Ageripe general of marine, and suite, with presents, kc,
for the Grand Seigmor. The Dey of Algiers by force cmpeUed captain

Bainbridge to perform this service, and threatened in case of refusal
war to the United States, and slavery to the officers and crew of the
George U-ushingtm. The Dey also ins'ited, that the ship Brutus
captain Brown, should unlade and go t o the isle of Rhodes, for a cargo
of Turks - no pay or freight to be dowed - but the voyage to be
considered as a favor granted b the United States. Through the
influence of the American ~ o n s Mr.
d O'Brien, and the ship's being
private property, and having a perishable cargo on board, she was
excused from this service. Captain B. embraced this favorable moment, fearing a further requisition, and quit Algiers, October 25.
Capt. B. brought dispatches to the Secretary of State, containing the
particulars of this extraordinary affair. Mr. O'Brien, the Consul,
and capt. Bainbridge had remonstrated, but were obliged to comply,
to prevent a more serious difficulty. Two days out from Algiers,
captain Brown was brought to by the British brig Carmelia; the Lieutenant of which informed that she was bound for Egypt, with &patches from Lord Keith; and that his lordship, with the fleet and
transports under his command, was destined for Egypt. On arriving
at Gibraltar no one was permitted to land from the B&u.s, because
she was from the Barbary coast - but an American, a resident there,
came along side, and informed, That the French marched into Leghorn
on the 10th of October, agreeably to the stipulation of the treaty with
the Emperor; that the inhabitants were much exasperated a t the
measure, and that i t had excited considerable commotion in that
unfortunate city.
The day the BWus arrived at Gibraltar, an American ship, owned
by Murray and Mumford, of New York, sailed, and was captured
by some Spanish gun boats in a few hours - she had previously been
boarded by the same boats, and cautioned against entering Gibraltar,
it being declared in a state of blockade by hls catholic majesty. She
however did enter and sell her cargo of flour; she was carried to Algesiras, and would probably be condemned. The gentleman also
informed, that the plague a t Cadiz continued its ravages, and that i t
had spread into the interior of Spain; that i t was at Malaga; and that
in consequence the English at Gibraltar were very strict in their quaran tine regulations.
The next day captah B, took advantage of the convoy of two frigates, which had under their protection 38 transports, most of them
full of troops, bound for Lisbon - before they got through the Gut,
a westerly wind s p m g up, which obliged the whole fleet to put into
the ba of Tutean, on the Barbary coast - found there, seven sail
of the h e , and 46 transports with more troops. Next day was joined
by Lord Keith, with four more sail of the line, and a number of frigates.
The fleet all that day and night were busily employed in watering,
not b e i i able to procure a supply at Gibraltar owing to the dry season,
Next day sailed with part of the fleet for Lisbon, leaving Lord Keith
with the residue, and most all the troops, a t Tutean Bay, from whence
it was conjectured that he was to sail for Egypt.
Captain Brown left
the fleet that night.
While at Algiers capt. B. procured the following information:
Skdch of Algerine Spoliations fm the last two years.
27 Sail Neapolitans, Sicilians and Maltese, having British Passports
from Lord Keith; vessels and cargoes condemned; crews, 215 condemned to slavery, claimed by the English, and not given up.

with France.
The Spanish Consul was 35 days in chains on account of the French
taking the brig Barshaw. Spain returned the brig and crew to Algiers,
accompanied with resents to the amount of 60,000 dollars - which
released the poor 8onsul
Look out! United st%& of America! or you will share the fate of the
Swedes a t Tripoli: - the Danes a t Tunis - and of many other Nations at Algiers.
The United States should immediately have six stout frigates in
the Mediterranean, to keep Roguers in awe. Should any accident happen to the George Washington, in her passage to or from Constantinople
the government of the U. States will be obliged to reimburse the Dey
all damages he may sustain thereby, or his most Potent Majesty
will order his corsairs to c a ~ t u r eAmerican vessels.
Among the presents seni to the Grand Seignor were one hundred
black slaves, 50 of them females -lyons, tygers, leopards, ostritches,
kc. &c. valued a t several millions of dollars. Captain Bainbridge was
obliged to hoist the Standard of Algiers a t his main-top-gallant-mastheast, instead of the American Pendant!
Tbe George Washington sailed on the 19th of October, upon her new
voyage, and may return to this country possibly in Jd next. She
had carried out to the dlgerine Government large suppges of stares,
which were received on acco~mtof the annual stipulated payments
from the United States. The English had offered a frigate for this
purpose, but the Dey did not like to trust them, for fear they would
secure the treasure to themselves, as there had been a serious misunderstanding with them. - Several Danish vessels were forcibly
taken into possession, and ordered for the Isle of Rbodes upon a simlar business with the Washington. The English Consul was a t first refused a reception a t Algiers, but
was finally permitted to remain there.
Notwithstanding the treatment Capt. Bainbridge received from the
Dey, the American Consul, and flag is more respected there than m y
of the European nations. The Algerines observed to capt. Bainbndge,
that he ought to consider i t a great mark of the dey's favour, to go
upon his Majesty's special business to the Grand Se~gnior- adding,
that i t was an honour he would confer on very few others. There &re
about 2,300 European slaves in Algiers - some of them from the
first families in Europe. The place appears very strong, but 6 or 8

[29 October 18001
Protest of James L. Cathcart, U. 6. Consul, Tripoli
To ALL WHOMIT DOTE OR MAY CONCERN
KNOWYE BY THEBEPRESENTS
that I James Lea' Cathcart Agent & Consul
for the United Staters of America in and for the City & Regency of Tripoli in
Barbary, finding just cause to complain of the conduct of Jusef Baahaw supreme
Commandant of mid City & Regency of Tripoli & his Ministers - towards the
Government & Citizens of the said U. S. of America and conceiving it my duty to
protest against said conduct Now know ye That I Do hereby Protest against said
Jueef Bashaw supreme Commandant of mid City & Regency and against his
Ministem & Counsellors, in behalf of the Government of said U S of America,
myself & fellow Citizens, for the followin reasons. To Wit FIRST:
Be i t known that an the I?*? of i u g u & 1799 said Jusef Bashaw supreme
Commandant of the Regency of Tripoli a t the instigation of Morad Raiz Admiral
of the Cruisers of this Regency, refused to receive the printed Passports iesued by
the Consul of the U S of America in this Regency in obedience to his orders from
government, thereby claiming a superiority or preference to the Regency's of
Algiers & Tunis he being duly infom'd that the a i d Psssports were accepted in
the same form by the Chiefs of the mid Regency's; And in order, as ia my firm belief
to have a pretext to send the Merchant vessels belonging to the Citizem of the
U 8,into this Port for examination said Admiral Morad having publickly declared
thst he would go to Sea with the v e w k under hie command without any Pasaport
from this O&ce if the[y] were not modiied to his likeing and worded similar to
the Passports of the British, And the mid Jusef Baghaw on application being made
by the wid Consul of the U S refuseing to exert his authority is s clear & sufficient
evidence that he was accessary to the insolent demand of said Morad or more
properly speaking that mid Morad acted if not by his orders a t least with his
tacit consent thereby forcing the mid Consul of the U S to deviate from hie
instructions and to submit from imperious neceesity to a humiliation incompatible
with the honor & dignity of the Nation he hss the honor to represent.
SECOND:Be it known That in the month of October 1799 said James Lear
Cathcart Consul for the U, S, of America in this Regency having recQ several bales
of CIoth to dispose of, that Baid Jusef Bashaw sent the Broker Leon Farfara to
the Consular home requesting said Consul to give him the.preference in the Bale of
said Cloth promising to pa for the m e like any other ~ndividualand as cloths
I knowing how be had lerv'd the late Venitian
were sold of the u m e
& Swedish Consuls on s similar occasion, sent Baid Leon Fsrfara to inform him
that the cloth was not mine and that I expected to be paid immediately in order

392

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1'386 TO 1801

to be enabled to make a remitance to my correspondent which he the said Bashaw
promised to do; I therefore confideing in his promise which I was taught to believe
was sacred to all true Mussulmen & more especially to a Prince of the August
family of Caramanly did deliver unto him Sundry pieces of cloth to the value of
Five thousand seven hundred & eighty Seven Yuslichs current coin of this Regenc
which a t that time was worth Spanish dollars two thousand three hundred
fourteen & 80 cents, two Yuslichs & one half being then equal to one dollar silver
but a t prest, the coin of this Regency having depreciated owing to the great quantity of alloy mix'd in the coinage a dollar passes for three Yuslichs which makes a
difference of one fifth part or 20
That I have repeatedly demanded the above
sum & have always been put o f l io;m
:
time to time with promises until the 2F
da of September 1800 when some Oil belonging to said Bashaw being selling a t
pubick vendue I sent my Drogornan to purchase a barrel for the use of my house
value about eighteen doll* which the Hasmadar refused to give unto him unless
I eent themoney to pay for it first; I sent the Drogoman immediately to the Bashaw
to know the reason who repeated the same words saying the Oil was not his but
belonged to the Crew of the Cruisers that if I wanted Oil that I must first send the
Caah; I immediately sent for Farfara who had acted as Broker in the sale of the
Cloth & desired him to demand a positive answer from the Bashaw whether he
intended t o pay me or not, that I was resolved to be kept no longer in suspense &
offer'd t o b k e the money a t the present value which is only 1929 dollars in full
of all demands; the Bashaw sent the same answer, which he had sent above fifty
times before; that he would pay me but that a t present i t was not convenient and
desired Leon Farfara t o inform me that if I had a mind I might take one of the
Swedish prizes for my money which I declined knowing that he having a quantity
of prize and other goods on hand for exportation, that he would probably force me
to take a cargo of a i d goods to Leghorn or else where, thereby exposing the U, S
to become responeible for said goods or their value should any accident happen to
mid vessel in the same manner as the claim originated upon Sweden which was
the firat & principal cause of the present war; I therefore have deem'd i t more
expedient to entirely lose the fore mentioned sum than t o run a risque which
probably might envolve my Country in a War And as i t appears from the above detail that said Bashaw never intends to pay
me the above sum in cash according to agreement notwithstanding I have his
receipt or promiseary note under the great seal of this Regency and I having
waited above one year for the payment of the said sum without eflect, I therefore
debit the U S the a i d sum in my Ace, current leaving the government of said
U S to make the said claim a National claim; no individual being bound to be
responsible for the arbitrary acts of the chiefs of the Barbary States, a t the same
time making myself responsible to the U S for said sum or any part thereof which
may be recover'd from said Jusef Bashaw hereafter THIRD:Be i t known That in the months of May September & October 1800,
That the said Jusef Bashaw supreme Commandant of the said Regency of Tripoli
having made certain demands upon the United States in direct violation of the
109 Article of the Treaty existing between the U S of America & the Regency of
Tripoli, which the Consul of the U S resident here found incompatible with the
honor & inter& of the Nation he re resents to comply with, That said Jusef
Baahaw in direct violation of the 12'9 Article of the said existing Treaty Did
ublickly declare that he would only wait untill he receives answers from the
reeident of the U S of America which if not satisfactory that he would then
declare War against said United States as is more full explain'd in my dispatches
to government copy's of which were forwarded to our 8onsuls a t Algiera and Tunis;
Article of said treaty that the
And whereat3 it is particularly specified in the
Money & presents demanded by the Bey or Bsshaw of Tripoli is a full and satisfactory consideration on his part & on the part of his Subjects for a i d treaty of perpetual Peace & Friendship & that no pretence of any Periodical tribute or farther
payment is ever to be made by either party, And said Bashaw of Tripoli havin
acknowledged the receipt of the money & presents stipulated by said Treaty;
find myself justifiable both to God and my Country in having refused to comply
with the mid Bashaws unjust demands u n said United States of America
And whereas it is stipulated in the IF! K i c l e of the foresaid Treaty that in case
any diepute arising from a violation of any of the articles of eaid Treaty no a p
shall be made to arms nor shall War be declared on any pretence whatever:
if the Consul residing a t the place where the dispute shall happen, shall not be
able to settle the same an amicable reference shall be made to the mutual Friend
of both parties the Dey of Algiers; the parties thereby engageing to abide by his
decision; And He by virture of his signature to the said Treaty having engaged for
himself & his eucceesors to declare the justice of the case according to the true

interpretation of the said treaty and to use all the meam in his power to enforce
the observance of the same.
Now KNOW ALL MEN BY THESE PRESENTS, That I Jamee Lear Cathcart Conaul
for the U S of America in said Regency of Tripoli Do protest and Declare that the
demands made by the Bashaw of Tripoli upon the United S t a h of America are of
such a nature that I cannot settle the dispute arising therefrom ; and that I conceive
that I should not only be deviating from my official duty but likewise acting aa an
accomplice and in conjunction with a i d bashaw of Tripoli to treat our good
friends the Dey and Divan of Algiera with indignity and disrespect was I to refrain
from making the foresaid amicable reference; I therefore in Virtue of these Presents
Do make the foresaid amicable reference transmiting the whole to the Consul genl
of the U S of America a t Algiers who is posseas'd of every information relative to
the state of our affairs in this Regency having rec4 duplicates of my diapatches for
the governement of the U S a t the same time leaving it a t the discretion of the
Consul genl of the U S a t Algiers for the time being to take such measures as he in
his judgment may think most likely to promote the interests of the U S and to
maintain the peace of our Country with this Regency upon honorable and equitable
terms
FOURTH: BE IT KNOWN that on the 25"f
September 1800 that &bizAmor
Shelli commander of a Tripoline Cruiser of 18 Guns captured the American brig
Catharine James Carpenter Master of & from Newyork & bound to Leghorn
valued a t 50,000 dollars or thereabouts, that said veasel was kept in possession of
the subjects of Tripoli untill the 15% of October in the evening and was then
deliver'd up to the Consul of the U S in consequence of the Bashaw of Tripoli
having wrote a letter to the President of the U S the purport of which being dready
known needs no repetition, and that said vessel was exposed to much loss & peril
as appears by the Master of said Brig his Protest already forwarded to our Consul
genl a t Algiers & that said brig was plunder'd of effects valued by mid Master
James Carpenter a t 397 hard dollars whereof was recover'd to the value of 180
dollars the value of 217 dolt being irrecoverably lost; notwithstanding the Bashaw
had given positive orders to Hamet Raiz or Minister of the Marine to cause every
article that could be found to be restored to their lawfull owner: Yet said Raiz
of the Marine did not comply with the Bashaws orders (& he being the Bashaws
Brother in b w it waa out of my power to compel him) but on the contrary prevaricated from day to day from the 16'h to the 219 of October with an intent no doubt
to share the spoils with the foresaid Raiz Amor Shellie and on the night of the 219
ins! sent Ibram Farfara to inform me that if the Brig did not aail by day light in the
morning that the Port would be embargoed & gave me to understand that if I did
not promise to pay him anchorage for said brig that she would be detain'd untill the
embargo should be taken off this demand I absolutely refused to comply wlth On the 22* a t day light I order'd the Brig t o get under way & could not get the
Pilot to go onboard untill said Ibrnm Farfara paid the e i z of the Marine five
dollars & 75 cents Anchorage which notwithstanding ~t belng an unjust demand I
complied with sooner than have the Brig detain'd one day longer
I therefore for the fore said reasons & for each of the aforementioned arbitrary
acts Do Protest against the foresaid Jusef Bashaw supreme Commandant of the
Regency of Tripoli in Barbary and against his Ministers & C o u n d o r s - but
more especially against said Mornd Raiz Admirbl of the Cruisers of this Regency
for being the cause of my altering the National Passports of the United States
of America & against said Hamet, Raia or Minister of the Marine for the ressons
before mentioned as well as for falsely imiduously & slanderously ssserting in
my presence 6: in the presence of Ca
Carpenter that the Consul genl of the
U S Rich4 OBrien it the Broker or E k k e r of a i d U f3 Micaiah Cohen B ~ r i
had inform'd him when he was last a t Algeirs that the government of the U S
had done paid to the house of Bacri & CQone hundred thouaand dollars for their
influence thereby irritateing the said Jusef Bashaw against the government &
Citizens of the said U S of America as the said Jusef Bsahsw seemingly gave
credit to the falsehood of mid Hamet Raiz & emphatically said that the Government of the United States had treated an Algerine Jew better & with more
liberality than they had the said Beshaw of Tripoli notwithstandin I gave the
direct lie without ceremony or hesitation to said Hamet & told the 8sshaw that
I wonder'd how he could give credit to EO barefaced a falsehood for even had the
U S given the above mentioned sum the party concern'd would be the last people
in the world to divul e the aame it not comporting either with their honor or
interest eapeciay to Bamet U i z who was not only an Enemy to tbe U. S but
likewise to his ExceIlency the Baahaw of Tripoli he having by his false ~nsinuations
endeavor'd to persuade the Bashaw to annul the Treaty of Peace 8: Amity a t
present subsisting between the mid tT S & this Regency to the prejudice of his

character honor & dignity whom word & signature I had always supposed ta
have been inviolably sacred: and that aaid Jusef Bashaw in answer to the above
said you say that Hamet Rail; lies and I eay he tells truth, thereby discrediting
11 I had said & giveing full credit to the imposition of said Hemet, Raiz or Minister
of the Marine
NOWKNOW ALL MEN That for the reasons afore assign'd that I James Leaf
Cathcart Agent & Consul for the U S of America in the Regency of Tripoli having
h e w n sufficient cause to enter this Protest against the aaid J u d Brrshaw aupreme
Commandant of the Regency of Tripoli his afore mentioned Minister & Counsellors; That I do by these presents most solemnly Proteet against the conduct of
said Jusef Bashaw his aforeasid Ministers & Counsellors as being unjust & in
direct violation of the lot? and 129 Articles of the existing Treaty between the
U, S, of America & the said Regency of Tripoli; And I James Lear Cathcart
Do further declare that the dispute arising from the violation of wid T m t y is
of such a nature that I cannot adjust the said before I receive express instructions
from the President of the United States of America or until1 our good Friends
the Dey B Divan of Algiers shall decide upon the judice of the case accordin
to the true interpretation of the existing Treaty between the U S of America
this Regency: And that I do hereby make an Amicable reference to our good
Friends the Dey and Divan of the Regency of Algiers prorniseing in the name of
the United States of America to abide by their decision agreeable to the true
meaning of the stipulation contain'd in the 12+ Article of the treaty of Peace
& city concluded between said U S of America & the Regency of Tripo1i.b~

the reigning Dey of Algiers Mustapha Baahaw whom God preserve
Now I James Lear Cathcart Agent C Consul of the U S of America conceiving
it my duty so to do, Do now transmit this said protest to the Chancery of the
United States at Tunis in order that it may be there duly reg~ster'd & from
thence forwarded to the Consul general of the U S of America a t Algiera in order
to prevent as much as depends upon me any appeal being made to arms leaving
the conducting of the whole affair entirely a t the discretion of the Consul genl of

TRIPOLI
IN BARBARY
NoOtF 1'* 1800
SIR By the dispatches which I have had the honor to forward to
the Department of State since last April you will be inform'd that
the Bashaw of Tripoli has annul'd the 10'P and 12" Articles of the

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS

395

Treaty between the United S t a h and this Regency I therefore on
the 29'." of October protested again~this conduct & forwarded the
protest to Consul gent OBrien a t &em in order that he might make
an Amicable reference to the most poted Dey of Algiers who I hope
on this occasion will not prove himself to be impotent for I assure
you I doubt very much whether ever he will interfere in o w favor
or not & in my opinion he ought not to be too much relied on. It
would be of no use to send you a copy of the protest & Reference at
present even had I time to copy it, as their is no knowing what effect
~twill have upon our affairs, I therefore have requested M: OBrien to
Register the said in the Chancery of the U S a-t Algiers & to forward
i t to the Department of State via Lisbon when he naturally will
inform you of the result In the present state of our affairs I could not find myself justifiable
in doing otherwise for in the 10* Article of the Treaty it is particularly
specified that the Money & presents demanded by the Bey or Bashaw
of Tripoli is a full and satisfactory consideration on his part & on the
part of his subjects for said treaty of erpetual peace & Friendship &
that no pretense of any periodical tri ute or farther payment is ever
to be made by either party & said Bashaw of Tripoli having acknowledged the receipt of the money and presents stipulated by Treaty I
found it highly improper to comply with any demands upon the U S
of America, And in the 12" article of the foresaid treaty i t is stipulated
that in case of any dispute arising from a violation of any of the
Articles of the said treaty, that no appeal shall be made to n m s nor
shall War be declared on any pretence whatever; But if the Consul
residing a t the place where the dispute shall happen, shall not be able
to settle the same an Amicable reference shall be made to the friend of
both parties the Dey of Algiers the parties thereby engaging to abide
by his decision & he by virtue of his signature to the said treaty having
engaged for himself and his successors to declare the justice of the
csse according to the true interpretation of the said treaty & to use all
the means in his power to enforce the observance of the same & said
treaty being ratified by the present Dey of Algiers it was my inevitable
duty to act as I have done, i t being entirely out of m power to settle
the dispute arising from the violation of the said Artic es of our Treaty,
it amounting to nothin less than making the U S of America tributary
to Tripoli which can e done by none but the government of the
United States; I have nevertheless submitted the whole to the decision
of the Consul gen !of the U S a t Algiers & left the manner of conducting
the reference entirely a t his discretion & hope that he will act in such
a manner as will promote the honor and interest pf our Country Should no reference be made to the Dey of Alfgers by us in the first
instance the United States would have been reduced to the following
humiliating & very embarrassing situation The Bashaw of Tripoli declares that he will capture our vessels if
we do not comply with his unjust demands, it is natural to suppose
that the Citizens of the United States w i l l defend themselves and not
pusillanimously surrender the vesels & cargoes entrusted to their
care without a struggle, The Government of the U S will probably
think proper to Chastize his arrogance & destroy his Cruisers where
ever the[y] shall be found, "Then would the Bashaw of Tripoli meanly
seek a subterfuge by making s reference to Algiers &tho he has disavow'd & in a great measure annul'd the whole of the Treaty aud how

g

T

%

396

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1786 TO 1801

do we know that if no reference is made by us, but our good Friend
the most Potent Dey of Algiers will insist upon our indemnifying the
Bashaw of Tripoli for the Cruisers which may be destroy'd by the
United States and in case of refusal declare War against us in virtue
of the stipulation contain'd in the 129b article of said treaty which
positively says no appeal shall be made to arms and al'tho this proceeding would be in every respect unjust, as the Bashaw of Tripoli is
the Agressor & not the President of the United States, nevertheless I
say it is possible and things of as dark a nature have already taken
place In my dispatches of last May I inform'd the Secretary of State
that probably 10,000 dollars would satisfy the Bashaw, at present
his ideas are much enlarged in consequence of his having captured
fourteen sail of Sweeds as you will be inform'd by the enclosed list
and if a force is not sent sufficient to intimidate him to compliance
thrice that sum will not be sufficient, as he has determined to establish
the following system from which he is resolved not to swerve unless
by force of Arms His revenues not being equal to his expenditures he is determined
to be at War either with the Danes Swedes or U S alternately to which
is to be added the Batavian Republic when a general eace takes place
in Europe He is now at war with the Swedes from w om he demands
to the amrnt of dollars 260 thousand for Peace & the ransom of 131
of their prisoners which he expects to conclude about March or April.
the United States are destined to be the next victim and that it has
been premeditated since before the departure of the Sophia will
evidently appear by the purport of my dispatches of April 1799 & the
Secretary of States answer to them dated the 15thof Jan? 1800 * * *
Thus Sir have I given you a particular acct of the Bashaws intentions, which points out the necessity of sending a sufficient force into
this Sea to repel the Bashaws demand in the first instance if not Sir
we will be subject to the above mentioned impositions & others will
ate of the same nature every two or three years which probably
be the means of conducting as many of our fellow Citizens into
as their are now unfortunate Sweeds and ultimately the
States will be obliged to take the measure I recommend to
them to take a t present become tributary to Tripoli and consequently
to Tunis or renounce the whole trade of the Mediterranean I t occurs to me that the reason why the Bashaw would not inform
me what were his expectations, is in order that he may have an opportunit to make an exorbitant demand upon us, even should he wait
un the Presidents answer arrives if unaccom anied with force, and
to declare War t r t us if I find it impossib e to comply with his
demands; I there ore conceive it my duty to alarm our commerce &
put them upon their guard, and being convinced that I have done
thing in my power to evade the impending danger; I leave the
res t to the will of the most high and should anything happen hereafter over which human rudence or foresight could have had no controd; I trust that I shafbe justifiable both to God and my Country
in having taken the above measures which at least will lessen the
Calamity if not entirely remove it The said plan of the Bashaws o erations may be depended on, &
have already been forwarded to t e Courts of Sweden Denmark &
Holland by their representatives and is the production of the same
villainous project maker that was the occasion of the demand upon

SIR,on the 13" ult. a corsaire of 22 g m s and 130 men, p~opertyof
the Bey's prime minister, received my passport, uith a destmation, as
was supposed, against Sweedes; but was in port until the arrival of a
sweedish frigate with regalia on the 22g From appearances I ap rehend his destination is changed against Americans. The Bey snBhis
minister were very particular in demanding of the chivalier Tornquin, sweedish Ambassador and Commander of their naval force in
the Mediterranean, whether he had fallen in with Ameriam; their
courses; whether armed; how manned; what size? kc. &c. Sundry
corsaires are now fitting out. A combination of circumstances s q gest the suspicion that their game is A ~ & M ! We are a t t h s
moment the only delinquents; every other tributary nation having
w i t h the space of six months laid their humiliations a t the feet of
this Bey. A detail of which shall hereafter be given: it is foreign to
the purpose of this letter. Our delays of payment of our peace stipulations are extremely unfavorable: they put too much to hazard.
The commerce of the United States in the Mediterranean, Mr Appleton a t Leghorn says, is nearly equal to that of all other carrying
nations.

I was at the palace this morning and yesterday. Says the Bey "What am I to deduce from all your assurances of punctuaIity on the
part of your Government?" I answered. Your Excellency will
have the goodness to believe that when the information of our definite
arrangements was recieved in the United States the stores which we
have stipulated as the condition of peace with you were growing on
our mountains, at the sources of our rivers - "Am I to suppose
then" said He "that your guns and your powder, cornprized in that
stipulation were growin on your mountains? You find no dif6culty
in discharging pour obfigations with Algiers. Do you suppose me
less able than Algiers to compel the punctual observance of treaties?"
By no means, s a d I, if we have been more attentive to Algiers than
to you it is not because we consider you less respectable but more just
than Al@ers. "We must make an end of compliment" said he, "It
would p v e me pain to affront you: but facts justify the conclusion

said he. What shall be done? I asked, shall we make war upon the

not be surprized if I reserve to myself the srtme previlege." Permit

menace I ought to know it for my government in giving passports
to your cruisers. "In this" said he, "you will use your own discretion.
If you give them it is an evidence that you are a t peace with me. If
you refuse them I have nothing serious to apprehend from it." Cutting reply; to which I made no rejoinder - I could draw not
direct from him. I do not know whether to sound an alarm or st'
to say AU is well! But, I venture to repeat, if something do not
appear soon to my relief I shall shortly be compelled, instead of
ordinary communications, to make my monthly reports of American
slaves.

I cannot but subjoin, it is the dictate of duty inforced by the
constant dread I suffer of seeing our seamen slaves here, that except

war from these licensed pirates Eztrads from postscripts presumably added to this letter

Is it not somewhat humiliating that the k t United States ship of
war which ever entered the Mediterranean should be pressed into the
service of a pirate? I am this moment informed, though not officially
that the George Washington has recieved a destination from "Patron
Grandi" to Constantinople - A prodigious distortion of treaty
grant - And, if true, I should suppose, would require strong reasons
to justify it - What may not be his danger in an empire where the
United States are not known - ?

I reclaim this packet to insert an extract of a letter this moment
recieved from M' OBrien, as follows - verbatim. [Here was quoted
letter to William Eaton, U. S. Consul, Tunis, from Richard O'Brien,
U. S. Consul General, Algiers, dated 19 October 1800, with the fol-

lowing notation made by William Eaton:]
Genius of My Country! How art thou prostrate! Hast thou not
yet one son whose soul revolts, whose nerves convulse, blood vessels
burst, and heart indignant swells a t thoughts of such debasement!
Shade of Washington! Behold thy orphan'd sword hang on a
slave - A voluntary slave, and serve a prate!
I never thought to find a corner of t h s slanderous world where
baseness and American were wedded - But here we are the by
word of derision; quoted as precedents of baseness - even by a Dane!
Shall Tunis also lift his thievish arm, smite our scarred cheek, then
bid us kiss the rod! This is the price of peace! But if we will have
peace a t such a price, recall me, and send a slave, accustomed to
abasement, to represent the nation - And furnish ships of war, and
funds and slaves to his support, and Our immortal shame History shall tell that The United States first volunteer'd a shi
war, eqmpt, a carrier for a pirate - I t is written - Nothing ut
blood can blot the impression out - Frankly I own, I would have lost
the peace, and been empaled myself rather than yielded this concession - Will nothing rouse my country".

SIR,Since sending off my dispatches yesterday I have recieved
information from Tripoli through a correct channel but not official,
that an American vessel, laden with sugar and coffee, has been carried
in by the corsaires of that regency; but has been released, and taken
her departure for Leghorn. And that the Bashaw has demanded of
our Consul, Mr Cathcart, as a condition of continuing pacific, an
a n n d tribute; and has granted siz months for an answer I had a long interview a t the palace this morning The Bey has
promised to wait one month for the arrival of the Anna Mariu. And,
I believe, I have gained the minister. There is therefore a reasonable
prospect that my projects will succeed to divert the expedition now
fitting out. No great reliance however can be laced upon assurances
which a diamond ring or a snufF-box may invaEdate [SDA. CL, Tunis, Vol. 1, July 1797-Dec. 1800.1

On board the U. S. SHIPof WAR
George T47ashington in the Port
of Constantinople 17 Novr 1800.
SIR I arrived here, on the 11 Inst, after a Passage of 23 days, we
came to anchor a t the lower end of the City of Constante 10 oClock
a t Night; in the morns: our Colours were hoisted a t the Mizzen, &
the Mission flag a t the Main. Shortly after three officers successively, came from the Grand Signior, to know what Ship we were, &
what Colours were them we had hoisted, Answered American frigate
& Colours. They said they knew no such place as America, we then
told them the new World, by that name they had some distant ideas
of us. after these enquiries we got under Weigh & came in the Harbour
of Constantinople, in entering of which I saluted the Grand S i o r s
Palace with 21 Guns.
The Captain of the Port came on board & brought us to anchor,
since which peiiod we have been discharging the Algerine Cargo C?
have this moment finished.
I cannot at present give the least information respecting my departure from this place; for the Algerine Ambassador will not have
his audience with the Grand Signior until1 the Captain Bashaw arrives from Egypt, whom I am told may be expected in 20 days; This
being a forced voyage at the risque of our Peace with AIgiers, you
must suppose that many humiliating occurrences will happen. I
shall endeavour as much as lies in my power, consistently to preserve
the Peace, but should a demand be made by their Ambassador, of the
Frigate's remaining 5 or 6 Months in this place, I shall consider myself justifiable in not complying to so long a time, a refusal may be
attended with threatnings of War which I candidly believe will never
be put in execution, would 6 of our Frigates appear before Algiers.
A list of their whole Marine force, I had the honor of enclosing you,
from that place, you there can see the pitiful force of the All powerjd
Algiers, to which is to be added, they have but only two Ports on
their whole Coast.
Believe me Sir, my information of that Country is so correct, that
I do not hesitate in saying, that 6 or 8 frigates in the Mediterranean
Sea, would give us more permanent security, than any Treaty that
can be made with the States of Barbary.
I brought letters of recommendation from the Consuls a t Algiers,
to the different Ambassadors here: I have waited on two of them,
the Earl of Elgin, the English Ambasr who received me politely, but
made no offers of public services, the other was the Baron de Huslech
the Danish Ambr who was polite & has offered his services to the
U. S. flag in the most friendly terms.
As yet I have met with no difficulty - In this Government almost
every public Concern is transacted thro' the Captain Bashaw who is
absent; I shall endeavour to make the flag of the U. S. appear as respectable as my present situation can admit. & also shall obtain epem useful
information for my government that my weak Capacity d l allow.
I have to assure you that my services are entmely devoted to the
will & interest of my Country.
Nov 19 yesterday Lord Elgin offered his services to the U. S. flag in
this Port in a friendly Manner [NA. SDA. Disp. Spain, Vol. 5, 1799-1806.1

NQ31. Duplicate.

TUNIS8. Dec. 1800
SIR, On the 25. ult. after having dispatched duplicates of my
letters from 1* to 16'P it was intimated to me that there was an
American ship in the road of Porto-farina. Instantly I sent off an
express to enquire for facts. On the 27'.h recd a note from Cap+Co&,
of the Anna Maria, informing me that he had been ten dnys in the
road without being able to communicate with the shore by reason of
the weather which was extremely bad. On the 28" I asked a boat
of the Bey to board her, which he said should be ready on the 30".
Accordingly, on the 30, I embarked at Tunis, in an open boat, and
arrived on board, ten leagues, at eight in the evening of the same day.
On the morning following Dec. 1st had the honor of recieving your
letter of 3OthAugust covenng an invoice and bill of the ship's lading Yesterday I returned to Tunis. Such part of the cargo as was between
decks was chiefly discharged before I left the ship. The quality of the
articles are acknowledged to be good; but i t is objected that the
plank and the oars are too shod - and the Government affect to be
dissatisfied that the keels, guns and powder are not come forward. I
believe the facts to be - the Government is dissatisfied that any thing
hm come f o r w a ~ d . If this opinion require evidence I consider i t
sufEcient to state that the United States are the on1 nation which
have at this moment a rich ungwtrded commerce in the editerrmean,
and that the Barbary regencies are Pirdes. I take to myself the merit
of having once more a t least suspended an expedition, which was
prepared for us. But we are yet defecient, and I am not without
apprehension that this deficiency will be resorted as a pretext for

h

surprizing our marchantmen - in which case they might do us
incalculable mischief. These are considerations which, it is supposed, should compel exertions to fulfil our obligations with this
regency.

A few days ago t.he Sapatapa sent a message to inform me that
The Beylique had need of thR American ship to go to MarseiUes. I
answered him that she was for charter. Three days were consumed
on the subject. I put him in mind of his promise of lo* of April last.
He resorted to the example of the [George] Wmhington a t Algiers and talked of force. I informed him that the affair of the Washington
had been mis-stated a t Tunis; that he was originally destined to
Consbntinople, after having delivered his cargo a t Algiers, to open
the door of negociation with the Sublime Porte; and that i t was considered a fortunate circumstance a t that instant that the Dey of
AJgiers had an Embassy to the Porte. Had this been otherwise, i t
is most probable, our Agent at Algiers would have asked i t as a favor
of the Dey to have assisted the project by sending some one of his
distinguished officers of government to introduce the American messenger As to force, if he thought suitable to exert i t in detaining the
ship to be loaded in his ports i t would be d s o necessary to use the
same means to conduct her to the port of destination; otherwise, put
what he would on board, I would order her to America, and leave the
event to be settled between my government and his. This position
I maintained in decided, though not irritating, language until a t
length he came to oEer a freight of four thousand dollars, and perquisites to the Captain, for the voyage. To these terms I thought
better to consent than to hazard the consequence of refusd, treaty
being dtogether in favor of the minister and accordingly made my
report to Captain Coffin, who says he should have five thousand
dollars at least for the voyage. I have not concluded the terms with
him; b u t am inclined to think he will finally accept those
eed with
the Sapatapa: If, otherwise, the U. S. should make a s m sacrifice
they have the satisfactory reflection that no dishonorable concessions
have been yielded to this government. I t is presumed the convention
with France, copy of which I have seen, will remove all legal impediments to this voyage, and annul the bonds of Captain C o 5 not to
enter a port of France: If not the constraint of thm Prince will have
the same effect. * * *

Circular letter to the U. S. Agents and Consuls in Europe from James Leandar
Catbcart, U. S. Consul, Tripoli

To the Agents and Consuls of the United States of America residing
in the different Ports of France, Spain, Portugal, Italy, the Barbary
States and British Garrisons in the Mediterranean and to all others
whom it doth or may concern.
GENTLEMEN,
I had the honor to inform you in my circular of the
12': of November 1800, that certain unjust demands having been
made by the Bashaw of Tripoli upon the United States of America
which I found it my duty to repel; that said Bashaw had publickly
snnounced in an official manner that he would declare War a ainst
the United States of America in six months to commence from t e 224
day of October 1800, if his demands which he purposely, made in an
evasive and indeterminate manner, were not complied with. I
further informed you that i t would be unsafe for our Merchant
Vessels to trade in the Mediterranean or it's vicinity after the 22q
day of March 1801, as these faithless People generally commit depredations before the time or Period allowed is expired. I likewise
informed you that I did not conclude in virtue of his promise that our
Vessels m g h t remain in the Mediterranean until1 the month of March,

I

but in consequence of this Regency being a t war with Sweden and the
Season of the Year.
I have now therefore to observe that a treaty of Peace and Amdy
having been concluded between his Majesty of Sweden and this
Regenc on this day the 3e of January 1801, i t is now no longer safe
for the erchant Vessels of said Un. St. of America to remain in these
seas or it's vicinity as the Swedes have made the following conditions
in consequence of their having 131 of their subjects in bondage, Viz.
They have agreed to pay Drs. 250,000 including all expences for
peace and the ransom of their captives, and 20,000 DoUars annually
m consequence of their being permitted to load here 3000 Tons of
Salt annually, and as I have every reason to suppose the same terms
will be demanded from the Un. St. of America m d that our fellow
citizens will be captured in order to ensure our compliance with the
aaid degrading, humiliating and dishonorable terms; I find i t my duty
to request you to take such measures as will most effectually prevent
any of our Vessels from trading on this Sea until1 you are advised
officially by me or either of our consuls at Algiers or Tunis that this
disagreable affair is terminated which from it's nature will require
much time as it extends to making the United States tributary to
Tripoli and must first be authorised by a particular act of the Legislature. I therefore request the above mentioned Agents and Consuls of the Un. St. of America and all others whom it doth or ma
concern to communicate the contents of this circular Letter to a 1
Merchants and Maslers of Vessels belonging to the United States, in
order that they may withdraw their property immediately from these
Seas and that our Mariners ma fly the impending danger. I likewise request them to make the etter circular and to transmit copies
of i t along the respective coasts of their residence and likewise to the
Department of State and wherever they may imagine that it will be
most likely to mswer the desired effect, as I have from hence but few
opportunities.
In testimony of the absolute necessity of using the &foresaid
precaution before i t should be too late, I hereunto subscribe
my name and a& the seal of my Office.

Frigate Thetis on the 24'b of December - On the 2"g ins-eutenant
Colonel Tornquist his Swedish Majesty's Envoy extraordinary concluded a peace between the Kingdom of Sweden and this Regency
upon the following terms, Videlicet

d

Dollars

To be paid for the Peace & ransom of 131 Captives- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 240,000 Contingent expences at leaat ------------------------------------ 10,000
250,000

Colonel Tornquist has engaged that the Kingdom of Sweden shall
pay unto the Regency of Tnpoli asnually the sum of 20,000 dollars in
cash in consequence of having permission to load fifteen ships of 200
tons burthen each a t Suarez generally pronounced Zoara, the Bashaw
gives the salt gratis the Swedes are to pay the expences of embarking
the said which will not be t d i n g The particulars of the agreement were that in consequence of the
above concessions, that the Bashaw would permit the Captives to
embark immediately & that the Ambassador should pawn his honor
that the cash should be brought here in six months or in less if possible that the Consul Mr Bohrstrom was to remain here & to exercise
the duty's of his Office as formerly, & with his household to enjoy
the same immunities as before the Wax commenced
On the 2"9 ins$ in the evening the Banners of Sweden were hoisted
by the Bashaws request upon the Danish house and a temporary fla
staff was prepared in order that the customary salute should be fire
next day - When a eace takes place with any nation i t is customary for the ditE3 Consu s to congratulate the Bashaw upon the event;
you may judge with what a grace I perform'd a ceremony so repugn ~ to tmy feelings, but it was necessary; I accordingly waited upon
his Excellency in company with the Danish Consul Swedish ex-ConBUI Mr Bohrstrom and others, after congratulation perfumation fumition & drinking of Coffee & Sherbet were over commenced the folf?w[ingl litigation "I hare concluded a peace with the Swedes (commenced the Bashaw) & I am certain the King of Sweden is sensible
that I was forced to declare war against his nation contrary to my
inclination, for had my demands been satisfied in the first instance, I
should not have captured their Ships & enslaved their people; some
nations added he (meaning the United States) have used me very
ill, the[y] look upon me as nothing, they have recourse to Algiers for
all things; I should be glad to know whch is thought most of a t Constantinople; I could easily have solved that doubt, by saying that the
Dey of Algiers had lately sent presents to the Grand Segnior to the
arnrnount of a million of dollars which were owerful arguments in
his favor; but as the conversation was generaf I did not concieve it
incumbent on me to answer his prologue any more than the rest of
the company; in fact I could say nothing but what I have communicated already - "The Bashaw observing my silence directed his discourse to me & ask'd me if I understood the Arabic & Turkish languages I answer'd that 1 had a trifling knowledge of them,
them so miserably that I never made an7 use of them,
his Excellency & ministers all spoke Itahan, "pray says
what was the present De of Algiera in the re= of Mohammed
Bashaw, I answer'd that e was a person very much respected in

Consequence of his being the cousin of H a s a n Bashaw, but had no
post whatever? and pray what was Hman Bashaw a t that time,
"first he was Vikelharche of the Marine & afterwards was made prime
Minister & treasurer in Algiers he wlas stiled the Hasnagi - The
Bashaw turn'd up his nose with visible signs of contempt and was
going to proceed when a person inform'd him that a piece of timber
was not to be found in the whole Regency large enough to make a
fiag st& for the Swedes, unless the[y] took one of the Cruisers spars,
"it is a, diflicult thing says t h Son of Aly B&w
to get to get a flag
staff put up when i t once comes down, when the American flag st&
comes down i t will take a great deal of grease (meaning money) to
get it up again;the danish flag staff is broke I hear & wants mending
with a new one, he smiled a ghastly grin and said after all what is
twenty thousand dollars a year for a Christian nation to pay that has
such vast resources "had I enough to live on, I would not trouble
myself with Cruisers, d'tho my subjects wishes War, because it is to
their advantage? how many Raizes (added he) have I that knows the
way to the great sea. Admiral Morad answer'd about twenty," their
not being I believe one capable but himself without his accompanying
them shews that the Bashaw & his Officerspays no great regard to
truth) well replied his Excellency I will find them vessels," in Tripoli
Consul we are all hungry, &c if we are not provided for we soon get
sick & peevish - As the Bashaw spoke in metaphors, I answer'd
him in the same manner by saying that when the Chief Physician
prescribed the medicine I should have no objection to administer the
dose, but untill then T muid say nothing upon the subject, "take care
answer'd the Bashaw that the medicine does not come to late, & if i t
comes in time that i t will not be strong enough Thus ended this audience, I should not be so minute in defailing
the circumstances was it not necessary in order that government
should be enabled to draw the fight conclusion from such materials
as I have in my power to furnish them with, which from the above
tls well as every other observation which I have been able to make,
seems to me to be exactly what I have already communicated to the
Department of State in mine of the 18'b of October and 1%of November already forwarded in Quadruplicates, with this addition that the
Bashaw having now establish'd a permanent annuity which has been
his grand scheme ever since he usurp'd the throne of Tripoli, that i t
places us next upon the list of depredations & gives some colour to his
demands, as it IS a known maxim in the Barbary States that when
one nation makes a concession the others must likewise or repel the
demand by force of Arms, which cannot so well be done when a
number of our fellow Citizens are in capeivit ; under this conviction
I have alarm'd our commerce, & d our severafConsuls in Europe does
their duty b next mwch we shad not have a vessel in the mediterranean, sensib e that this is the only ma to lessen the calamity, for
much better is i t for us to lose our tra e in the medjterranean for a
few months than to have our vessels captvred &.Cltizens enslaved
which would work the same effect besides ~mpedemgthe operations
of Government & probably would in some measure be the means of
forceing us to comply with the humiliating and degrading terms which
Sweden has already in consequence of having one hundred $ thirty
one of her subjects in slavery The Danes are exactly in the same situation as the United States
except this difference; the Bashaw has demanded from Denmark an

f

1

408

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1785 TO 1801

annuity of 20,000 dollars & from the United States he has made no
specific demand, indeed he could not as I repel'd the idea of our
becomeing tributary with indignation, but a t present his ernissarys &
every other person of intelligence in Tripoli knows that on those terms
alone Sweden Denmark America & Holland will be able to maintain
their peace with this Regency Comodore Koefoed who commands a danish squadron in this sea in
consequence of the truce expiring between Denmark & Tunis I believe
in Februaq, is expected here very soon, if he acts with energy i t will
give security to us I hope until1 measures are adopted by government,
but if Denmark concludes upon the same terms that Sweden has, the
same week our flag staff comes down, unless the Dey of Algiers interferes with uncommon energy, N-hich from the tenor of Mr OBriens
communications I have not the least reason to expect, but before
anything can be effected here I imagine i t will be necessary to ask
permission from the most Potent Dey of Algiers in consequence of
the stipulation contain'd in the 12th article of our Treaty with this
Regency as is more fully explain'd in my former communications: I
a m convinced that this step is necessary, notwithstanding the Dey of
Algiers has never interfered in favor of the United States since my
arrival a t Tripoli, * * * * * *
The Bashaw has evidently betray'd his real character in the above
negotiation, & has given s a c i e n t proof of his cowardice, "this will
poult out the expediency of sending a suf6cient force into the mediterranean with the greatest dispatch in order to prevent the U S from
sharing the same fate as the Danes a t Tunis & Swedes a t Tripoli "I have effected every thing possible to be done by an individual to
preseme my Countrys peace upon honorable & equitable terms & to
this instant has not made one concession; but what can remonstrance
avail where their is no justice to be obtain'd but by force of arms &
no friendship exists but what is ins ired by hopes of gain. I shall
endeavor to temporize with the Bas aw & if possible gain time until
I receive instructions from government which if not accompanied
with force will only prepare the way for exorbitant demands, which
the Bashaw expects will be equal to what is given by Sweden, & if
we pay this Regency 20,000 dollars pr annum this year, you may
depend that the next we will be obliged to pay Tunis 30,000 & Algiers
40,000 a t least, notwithtanding the stipulataon for 3000 Tons of salt
annually being made merely as a blind in order to prevent the other
Regency's from increasing their demands upon Sweden, but I am in
doubt whether i t will answer the desired effect -

Before I conclude, I am under the necessity of observing that my
situation is peculiarly disagreeable; I have not onl the peace of my
nation to maintain but the influence & intrigues o the whole Sanhedrim of Algiers & Tripoli also to counteract, unsupported by government, not having receiv'd but one letter from the Department of
State in two years, neither have I heard from our minister a t Lisbon
since the 8'4 of last April, add to this that my instructions are merely
answers to some questions which I ask'd before m departure and
are couch'd in such terms as will not authorize my ta ing one decisive
measure unless first approved by a man who has done nothin (this
two years past) but wnte nonsense dictated by the perfidious ews at
Algiers, & who has not taken one step to enforce our treaty by that

Regency since my arrival a t Tripoli, the whole of his communications
being s complicated chaos of contradiction misrepresentation ignorance & duplicity mixt together with rocks shoals anchors cables masts
rigging & a thousand other absurdities which would puzzle La
Lewis or any one else to understand; the only article in which he as
been consistant is in demonstrating a desire of throwing the whole
of our affairs both a t Tunis & Tripoh into the hands of the pusillanimous jews as they are a t Algiers & of writing unintelligible metaphors
no more to the purpose than the proverbs of the inimitable Cervantes
de Saavedras auxiliary Hero Sancho Panca were I request you Sir to take my situation into serious consideration,
& to represent our &airs with this Regency to the President &
government in such a manner that more attention may be paid to
them than has been heretofore, that the existing abuses may be
reform'd as soon as circumstances will admit, or that otherwise the
President will please to appoint some person more adequate to the
task imposed upon me than I am; for I find that I cannot under
existing circumstances remain longer here, unless I should be base
enough to become the Agent of the Bashaw of Tripoli & his friends
in Algiers, and theirby betray the honor & interest of my Country &
act in a menner inconsistant with the dignity anuex'd to my character
as the representative of a free independent & magnanimous nation;
& unless very great alterations indeed are made in our arrangements
as i t is impossible to serve both God and Mammon On the 26'? of December Citizen Billon ratified the Truce concluded
on the 26" of November between the French Republic and this
Regency, the terms differs from the terms obtaiu'd a t Algiers & Tunis
but very little "the Bashaw is very much affraid of the French in
consequence of the eastern provinces of this Regency (Bengasse &
Derna) being ve much disaffected, & he is apprehensive that they
would join the x e n c h of Alexandria should they contemplate the
conquest of this Regency, "if our treaty with France is founded on
the Basis of our treaty of 1778 the puting in execution the 8* article
would be of great service to our interests here; for so long as the french
holds Alexandria it is the interest of the Bashaw of Tripoli to make
every reasonable concession to that Republic, otherwise his eastern
provinces are irrecoverably lost to him & his successors" Government will determine upon the propriety of the measure - * * * * * *
The original of which this is a duplicate was enclosed by his Danish
Ma'estys Consul genl here to their Agent a t Malta to be forwarded
to huro e & from thence to America by the f i s t conveyance, this
goes enc osed to Mr Eaton a t Tunis.

Washington. and is detained a t Constantionople were Chiefly the most
rich and h t men of this Regency. these considerations must induce
this Regency to acquise to the demands of the Grand Signior - but
one of Greater Magnitude is that Lord Keith with the British fleet
and 21 thous? troopes is a t the Island of Rhodes. The Captain
Bashaw - and fleet with 30 thousand turbs will shortly leave Constantionople to Join Lord Keith. 20 - or 30 Thousand Turks is at
Jaffa - or Joppa these united. will rondevouse a t Rhodes. and a.11
proceed and make an attack on alexandria. ;to such great forces the
french would be obliged to capitulate after t h dl would Visit Algers
and Tunis. rob and plunder and destroy those Governments. and leave
tributary Bashaw? in Each place subservant to. the orders. and influence of the Grand Signior This consideration has struck this
regency. with Terror. and obliged Them to acquise, Such Sir is My
Ideas If the Grand Signior Keeps his station. The more he finds that
Algiers hes given way The more ho will expect. The Grc S i o r
has not much money. i t is an article he much wants. Algiers has
every thing he could wish for, and of course after a.U this. all
treaties of the Christian powers should be first made with the Grand
Signior. and under his gaurentee if not. we are at the mercy and
ca rice of every Petty Pirate of Barbary - and the Grand Signior
not admit. The 3 Eastern States of Barbary to be a t peace with
any nation but agreeable to his interest and orders - france will never
again seek a peace with these 3 piratical States. when the[y] conclude
with the Grand Signior. Theb] will oblige him to make and gaurentee.
for algiers Tunis and Tripolia - under these considerations we have
no time to loose in sending an ambasador to Constantionople. (The
dey requires it) and we should with him send tm7o of our largest
frigates in Gra.nd Order. it will give the Eastern world an Idea of
what might be expected in a few years from the Western world and
you will see fully the necesity. and faire prospects. by The important
communications and information which Caps Bainbridge wdl give
you - a peace once made with the Grand Signior is a peace of duration and Stability. and of great political and Commercial advanteges
to the United States. i t will not be on so Capricious a plan as our
peace with the Barbary States. which is as much to be depended on
as The winds in the Variable Lattitudes. The same time as the
lar e nations or ships breaks the ice we can foilow with Ease. This
I B ould suppose would be our policy. The same time the dey will
make a haw1 to repay him. for his present losses- I hope we shall not
be the Victim: we are nearly 2 5 years in arrears no funds has a valuable
and ungaurded Commerce in this Sea - we are.Threatened by all
Barbary. Therefore we should act with E n e w e make good our
stipulations and annuities hare Consular funds. not to be depending

COPY
James Leander Cathcart Consul for the United States of America
in the regency of Tripolia unto his Exelency Jusef Bashaw supreme
Commandant of the regency of Tripolia in Barbary - Health,
Peace, & Prosperity
Your Exelency having communicated verbally to me your intention
of declareing War against the United States on the 9" & 16 inst, that
immediately you had resolv'd to take the necessary measures for so
doing, if thew Consul did not give you assurances, that the said
States would enter into seperate negotiations, & agree to the following
demands, without soliciting the interferance of the Dey of Algiers;
whose Guarantee of the subsisting treaty between the United States
of America, & this Regency your Exelency declar'd to be null & void,
& your Exelency having authenticated said declaration by the most
solemn Oaths & imprecations, which since having been reechoed by
your Commissioner Cidi Hammet Daguize, & Broker Leon Farfara,
gives me reason to think your Exelency is sinceere.
That your Exelencys likewise demands the sum of dollars 225,000,
as the price of said seperate peace, and an anuity of twenty thousand
to perpetuate the same.
Your Exelency likewise declard, that if the President of the U S
of America was dispos'd to treat with vou, without the interfeerance
of Algiers, that you would become moderate in your demands, .but
not till then. I haveing explaind to your Exelency the impossibility
of my countenancing any such demands against said Stabs, or entering
into any discussion whatever respecting them, much less agreeing
thereto, a repitition a t present is unnescesary, nevertheless I deem it
expedient once more to inform your Exelenc , that the alteration in
the treaty can be made by none but the resident of the United
States, by & with the consent of the Senate, & that the demand for
Cash for which your Exelency has not been able to assign any reason,
must be authorm'd by an act of the whole Legislative body of Our
Country the result therefore depends upon them alone, & will take
much time to determine. That nevertheless to evade as much as
depended upon the consequences of a destructive Wa?, the 1ssue.of
which to booth parties being uncertain, I would enter lnto a negoclation with your Exelency, to procure time for you to state your demands
to the President of the U S of America, & to receive answers from
him. which from the great distance between Our Country, & the time
an affair of such im ortance would take in discuss~on,elghteen
Months waa absolub y necessary. Your Exelency answer'd that

J

rovided I would pay you for that time, you would write to the
$resident of the United States L wait s sufficient time for his answer
to arive.
After various discussions on the 16P Ins*the following arrangement
obtain'd the consent of both parties, viz your Exelenc did romise to
state your demands to his Exelency the President of t e U of America, by Letter, & to Wait the term of eighteen months from the date
thereof for his answer, in consequence of your receiving from the
Consul of the United States of America a t Tripolia, the sum of 20,000
dollars in bills upon Algiers a Tischera, of two thousand dollars for
Cloth, purchas'd from me but not paid for, & presents which Had
Mahammet Lasore brought from Algiers; which last agreement I o
agree to fulfill, but no other whatever
I do further declare that on his Exelency the Bsshaw's sending me
his Letters in Quadruplicates, & promiseing to give me a rec't for the
articles I shall deliver to him, specify'g that he will make no further
demands upon the United States during the Limmited period of
eighteen months, that I will immediately deliver to him the above
mentioned bills, Tischera & presents.
In testimony of the above, I have hereunto subscribed my name &

Letters of Novr 1800 and Jan7 1801 of the State of our affairs with this
Regency, I have now to add that all hopes of accomodation has subsided, I therefore request ou to detain all Merchant Vessels Navegating under the Flag of the States in Port and by no me- to permit
any of them to Sail unless under Convo as I am convinced that the
Bashaw of Tripoli will commence ~ o s t g st against the U. States of
America in less than Sixty Days from t e date hereof, and I am
persuaded he has made his demands upon the U. States for no other
reason than to have an unjust Excuse for Capturing our Vessels and
Inslavin our fellow Citizens, the[yj being of such a nature that none
but the $resident of the U. S. by and with the Consent of the Senate
can agree to, and I having offered him the Sum of 30.000 Doll@merely
to state his demands, and to waite untill answers arrive from the
President which he has refused to accept, a s&cient Proof that his

Suggestions and comments concerning United Statea Ships of War, by whom not
indicated, but presumably by someone in the ofice of Secretary of the Bavy

I t will probably be some time before it may be determined where
the six Frigates to be kept in constant service, shall be employed.
The Chesa eak[e]
The Genl reene
The Jnq Adums dZ
The E'ssex - three of the 13 frigates to be retained - are now
in the ports of the U States, & without Crews of course laying a t fittle
Expense - nothing seems to be necessary to be done for the present,
with res ect to these Ships, but to let them remain as they are.
But tge Frigates Preddonf & CmteUatiOn are also in port - and
with full Crews on board. The Crews of both Vessels have several
Months to serve. Mr Stoddert takes the Liberty of suggesting, that
they shall be immediately discharged - I t wjll save considerable
expense - and some uneasiness on board, for nothing is more dkagreeable to a Sailor than to be kept long on board of Ship in port.
If it should be determined hereafter, that either or both these
frigates should be employed, there will be no difficulty in procuring
Crews for them, without expense, for the Men receive no bounty (The advances made being always deducted out of their pay -) &
without d e l ~ y . The Men are so fond of the Public Service, that
there is never any difficulty in getting any Number wanted. By this
Arrangement too - The Ships should they be ordered on dlstant
service, will have crews havin 12 Months to serve - We can only
enlist for 12 Months - ~houfdthey be sent to the Mediterranean
with the present crews, the Mens time will be out, so as to oblige the
return of the Ships in a little time after arriving there. As to the
Ships to be sold - some are already in port - as fast as others arrive
they can be stripped of their Men, & remain in port a t little expense,
until a sale is ordered. But the Connedicul one of these Ships ~snow
st New London, with a full crew on board prepared to sail for
Batavia - She might turn over her Crew gt Promions to the Gem1

proceed to 3!f atavia - or the crew might be discharged, if it should
not be thought necessary to send a Ship to Batavia - and the princi-

SIR,The A [AlgerineJ corsrrirs is as yet all in port - and waits the

On the 15 Ins: I sent to the Dey requesting he would permit a 24
letter to be wrote by his orders to the Bashaw of Tripolia, he answg
thnt his letter has certainly gone safe and would answer the desired
effect. April the 5* this morning a t 8 a. m. the prime Minister of
m e r s sent a Choux or Constable to me to inform me that the
Americans was in arrears in their annuities nearly 3 ears. That what
has been sent lately - is very trifleing and thnt t e Dey is not well
pleased a t this neglect or detention. I answQy my Droguman to
ve my best respects to the prime Minister to inform him that in our
Cst settlement we arranged the annuities for 2 years and 9 months,
that 1 year was considered by the U. S. to be obmitted, that we had
bmughf sundry stores since {in the Sophia and [George] Washington)
which were not counted. That great commissions of Timber m d other
articles were wrote for or ordered by the Regency on the annuities,
that these articles I ex-pected were preparing in the U S to be shipt
for Algiers that our rivers were froze^ until Marcb and thnt by this
time I expected said articles were shipt and would of course come forward sufficient to ans' all the requisite stipulations on the part of the
U. S. which were due to the Regency
The prime Minister observed that we were much in arrears more
so than is customary to admit any Nation. That he hoped shortly
these requisite articles on the rtnnuities would soon arrive at Algiers,
that they were the chain of our friendship with this Regency - this
looks squally -

To Secretary of State from William Eaton, U. S. Consul, Tunis

Despatch NQ35.
TUNIS109 April 1801
Sm, The dispatches herewith inclosed Tom the C d of fha United
States at Tripoli seem to me of so muc consequence to the safety
and interests of our maritime and commercial citizens, and, in the
event, to the revenue of the government, that I not only feel myself
justifiable but constrained b duty to use extraordinary means to
communicate them to the Apartment of State: I have therefore
chartered a Regusee brig to proceed direct1 with them to the United
Stakes on conditions expressed in a trans ated co y of the charter
party, herewith inclosed. I prefer this flag as least Eable to be turned
out of its course; and I dispatch the vessel in ballast to prevent all
possible annoyance. The expense of this expedient bears so small a
proportion to the interests it aims to secure that I cannot doubt it
will recieve the President's approbation: I t is now more than nine
months since the alarm passed through this office from Mr Cathcart;
it would seem some fatality must have intercepted it in its passage
to America: possibly Mr OBrien's construction of the cause of the
Bashaw's demand may have betrayed Government into a security.
Facts are now indubitable. The Bashaws corsaires are actually out
and fitting out against Americans - And the Agent of our Government a t Tripoli is taking measures for the safety of himself and family.
I have advised him not to give his passports to the corsaires except
the Bashaw will explicitly declare they are not destined against
Americans; and, in case of refusal of such explicit declaration, to
make haste to get himself and family to Tunis. I advance this
counsel because it is become a stratagem of these Bashaws to decoy
their game with Consular Passports; and because, in caw of war,
Mr Cathcarts remaing in the hands of Tripoli would tend rather to
embarrass than to assist any measures Government should take to
reestablish the peace. The Bashaw demands, as a condition of sparing
us, Two hundred and twenty five thowand ddlars, prompt payment,
and Twent five thowand annually: Terms to which the Swedes
have agreel and which will be demanded of the Danes. But if our
Government yield these terms to the Bashaw of Tripoli it will be
absolutely necessary to make provisions for a requisition of double
the amount for the Bey of Turns. Algiers also will be to be respected
according to rank. If the United States will have a free commerce
in this sea they must defend it: There is no alternative. The restless
spirit of these marauders cannot be restrained. Here is not, at this
moment, a vessel on the Mediterranean except American which they
can touch. The king of the Two Sicilies has strictly prohibited any
of his vessels going to sea - Spain is embargoed by a dread of the
English - Denmark and Sweden are infriendship with the regencies ainst the French they dare not cruise - And England is in
iance with them. Our commerce is rich; it is defenceless: these
are good causes of war. Five days ago the Bey of Tunis let me know
that he wanted a number of 24 pound iron guns to mount castle
batteries; and desired his friend, the Presi&ent of the United States,
wouLd send them to him: his object in calling me to the palace was,
through me, to make this communic'tttion to the President. After
three hours discussion I decidedly refused to write the President on
the subject: but believed, if the Bey would propose to change the

I

i

%

431

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS

guns, due to him by treaty, for larger calibers, and if t h o s e r h y i
not already left America, the President would have no d culty m
making the exchange. The Bey thought it very hard that the United
States gave f ' ates to the Dey of Algiers to indemnify him for delays;
but that himse ,who had waited four years for his treaty stipulations,
could not prevail on the Agent of that Government to state h s demand
s on the same consideration:
'Or a
He wou d write the President himself. I refused to write, because,
I find, when these Bashaws prevail on a Consul to state a demand to
his Government they consider it as an assumpsit. I shall recieve
the Bey's letter tomorrow - and give it a passage in this express.
I t may be considered as the prelude to outrage - In this way the
rupture with Denmark had its origin - But here is no immediate
danger, I believe. It is to be hoped, however, the President will
return an answer: i t will be flattering to the Bey. I t was one article
evance on the part of the Danes that the King did not answer
his etter directly - This Hi hwayman is much the most GentleOf
manlike of the three. He sel om robs a man without first creating
a pretext. He has some ideas of justice and not wholly destitute of
a sense of shame. He is vain of the notions of integrity and honor
which he imagines the nations accord to him - and m this point he
is vulnerable - I state these observations that the President ma
form an answer on them. While we me in difEculty with ~ r i p 0 5
i t seems to me a good policy to be on good terms with Tunis: But if
Govt should think differently; and, in lieu of a ship with presents,
will consign to me a transport with h e thowand Marines, between
twenty and thirty eight years of age, native Americans, and properly
officered,under convoy of a 44 gun frigate, I pledge myself to surprize
Porto farina and destroy the Beys arsenal. Again, I repeat, something
must be done: And, we must dtimately rely alone on the strength of
our own arm. Wh should we be any longer amused by the smk of
Jewish perfidy in ATgiers? * * *
This may serve as a caution against passing any thing through
Algiers which may indicate coercion against the Bashaw of Tripoli I t gives me pain to present these facts. I would willingly suppose
them the effect of a blind confidence, had not so many demonstrat~ons
offered to evince the perfidy of the Jews, and did not OBrien nevertheless persist in his attachment to them. He alleges for his reason
that Government affords him no adequate support and he is consequently compelled to this resort - If true i t 1s hoped Government
will remidy that difficulty - * * *

Gentlemen, from the Lieutenan& thirty six & from the midshipmen

SIR, When I last wrote you on the 18" U l t ~I transmitted Copy of

advising the great appearance there was of the Bashaws acting in a
hostile manner - a g m t the United States, his predictions have been

I have just reeaiveBfmm Richg OBrien Esqr Consul at 4 e r s dated
5 Inst$,as there are several of our vessels now in the Mediterranean,
I am under great apprehensions that some may have ere now fallen
into their hands, which will prove a most distressing circumstance,
and occasion a great difficulty to bring them to terms. I sincerely
hope a few Frigates are now on the way for these Seas a Small force
would be SufEicient to block the Tripoly Cmizers in their Ports, and
obhge them to admit of conciliatory measures, indeed there should
alwa s be some on this Station, for the Protection of our Navegation,
whic up the Mediterranean is very extensive, and must till then be
constantly exposed to the Caprice of all the Barbary Powers: - I
never expected they would have remained so long on a good footing
with the U. S. for scarcely a Year passes without some one or other of
them making depredations on the Commerce of Denmark & Sweden.
I have been particularly attentive in dispatching Copies of Mr
Obrien's Circular to Gibraltar Csdiz, Corunna Santander, France
Hamburg & London, in order that the Captains of American vessels
may be on their guard, & abstain from going up the Mediterranean
till matters are arranged, as the Tripolitans have I understand only

ATaq Depd I'f May 1801
Your two letters of 24 Ultg have both come to hand - The Essez
being without a Boatewain & Gunner, or having such as Capt Preble
does not approve I did hope that he would have supplied hs ship at
Norfolk on that account I declined ordering the Pett Officers to be
aid off - Lt John Smith is ordered from the Cz 9sapeak to the
$resident & 1 thin day ordered L t Wood to proceed Immr to Norfolk
& there meet the Essex. which ship Capf Bainhridge will Command.
Much very much is to be done towards putting the Nav in a situation
that ma conduce to its Respectibility While I Act. I s all feel myself
under o ligatiom for your aid & advice No Mention being made of the Rnival of the Provisions from New
York & fearing some Misfortune has happened to the vewll from the
late terrible Weather, f yesterday ordered a farther supply to be
sent - The Philadd+hauled out on Wedenesday & would soon be
manned - The Essez will leave New York this day or tomorrow
she had all her Crew, those of the Conmdicut were turned over to
her - The Enterprize I expect will sail before the 5" lnst she has been
ddayed by getting New Masts -

I am favoured with yours of 26'P UltQCapt Decater had an idea
that the DecLining to proceed on the proposed Expedition might effect
his Reputation In t b he is mistaken - H a m g ordered Capt S.
Barron for that service, I could not without introducing an appearance
of uncertainty [in] the duties of this Department, make the Charge a
Second time - Once done I have written Capt Decatur I t must not
be undone - He will have full time now to adjust all his private
affairs The high opinion entertained in this Department of Capt Campbell
added to your Recommendation makes me extremel anxious to
retain him in service bud howl - Had he remained ifaster Commandant, It might be done thus - The ships to be imployed are
divided into two s uadrons - I am disposed to give a Master Commandant to each ommodore & trust Congress for approbation - I
have thought of
us Talbot (now of the Unided Stafes) for one
squadron and I co d wish Capt Campbell for the other perhaps he
would agree to hold his present Commission & accept the Pay &
Emoluments of Master Commandant Mr Renshaw is retained in service & ordered to actual service - I
shall with dSiculty get thro the arrangement of Midshipmen 1 shall
great with the Captains M
have some with Lieutenants & ve

liberty to inform you that the Articles in the following document
d a m m e r as if imeare blnding upon tho U. S of America in as f
diately signed by the President of the United States of America First - As I have no power to enter into any negotiation either
for the re-estsblishment of Peace between the United States of
America & the Regency of Tripoli or for to settle a truce between
the said powers I consequently can not Q1 will not delegate any to
you; but in order that the doors of accomodation may be ke t open
should the Bashaw propose terms more favourable than t rlose so
long in agitation you will please to forward them to me to Tunis for
my consideration Second
As the Bashaw of Tripoli has pawn'd his honor that no
captures shall be made by his Cruisers until1 after the expiration of
forty days to commence from the declaration of War on the 14'? of
May (exclusive) any Vessel or Vessels that mag be captnred before
that period expires, you will please to claim (in vlrtue of mid promise)
in the name of the United States of America Third - As I have been repeatedly refused the Passports of the
U. S. of America by Morad R m notwithstanding the positive Orders
of tbe Bashaw to give them to me and as their are several more of
which I shall leave a memorandum you will please to receive them
should the[y] be returnd, before the Cruisers of this Regency sails

the house is a t your disposal entirely, but I could wish you would
permit Citizen Severe Nodi to reside in i t in preference to any otgher
in consequence of his politeness in furnishing me with the Vessel to
depart in Fifth - The allowance given to the American Citizens that were
in captivity at Algiers was to each Captain eight dollars pr month
to each Mate & supercargo Six & to each manner three and three
quarters, and to each a change of cloaths you will please to give them
the same, sllould any be captured which is hardly probable, & you
will please to advance to each Captain a t your own discretion to the
ammount of fifty dollars each upon their private note specifying that
they will refund said sum to me shoulcl it not be allowed by government I shall endeavor to leave funds here if possible; if not you will

United States that you did for the subjects of Sweden tbe United
States will in like manner indemnify you for any loss you may sustain, a t the same time I request you to reduce the risque as much as
circumstances will permit It is presumed the Captains & Officers will behave in such a manner
as not to abuse the confidence you place in them should it be otherwise the mode of procedure is left a t your own discretion as I am
certain you have too much humanity to permit the innocent to suffer
for tho culpable Seventh - Small presents may be given occasionly to guardians to
procure rest from labor & to o b t a i ~as~ good treatment as possible for

Nq 6 - Triplicate
SIR- The followiug is a Journal of occurences since the date of my
dispatches forwarded direct to America by our Consul a t Tunis On April the 199 I received a packet from Mc Eaton st Tunis
which came enclosed to Mf Nissen containing letters from Messs
Smith and Obrien, from the former of the lot? of November & 4* of
Februaq in which I am inform'd that several of mg dispatches have
been forwarded to the Department of State;Mr Smth communicates
to me his entire approbabon of the manner in which I had conducted
our affairs & says the steps which I had informd him I should take
seem'd well calculnted to avert any impending danger untU I should
receive instructions from the President & observes that untill we have
a suÂ£6cient force in the Mediterranean to protect our commerce we
must give money in order to prevent the ruin of our commerce &
capture of our fellow Citizens, and hopes that government are fully
sensible of the expediency of sending some strong Frigates into the
mediterranean and that some are already on their way in which
ho e I 'oin him most cordially Mf Smith acknowledges the receipt of
a &cdar but adds that by h. last letter from A1 'em Consul OBrien
gives him hopes that the steps he has taken a t &em (of which you
are informd - I having forwarded Mr OBriens letters to me in my
dispatch No 3 of this year) will have been sufficient to avert for the
present the Bashaws menaces - The letters from Consul OBrien
were dated the 31" of December (which I have alrendy forwarded
in triplicates some observations on the back thereof excepted which
I did not before receive & are of no consequence whatever) 19* of
January & 2'J and 20+ of February, "On the back of his letter of the
199 of January is wrote the following paragraph "this letter under
cover to Consul Eaton and unsealed is for him to peruse and to inform
me that it is so far as Tunis proceeding upon his Journe
the same time I will thank Consul Eaton to ask Azu ru IfTripolia,
by this
conveyance that he received the Deys latter for the Bashaw of Tripoh
as i t ~9 orderd to be there given to the Algerine Vikd whom is to
forward it 05cirrlly to the Son of Aly Bashaw - "If any such letter
has really arrived here it has been kept
rofound secret from me,
notwithstandii I have made every posslb e en u k y and the result
shews that it has either never arrived or the ~ d a has
w despised its
contents; in either case the effect produced is the same - I had
recommended to Mr OBrien to forward the Deys letter to Mr Eaton
in Order to have it translated by Mr Adamson who translated the
alteration in our Treaty which I presume was 8 more m er conveye ecretcrrg a t
ance than the one alluded to Mr OBrien had bribed

Algiers very properly in order thst he might write more forcible; his
forwarding the letter in the manner I had advised could have been
attended with no dBculty; enclosed is the duplicate of his letter of
the 8 of February and in his of the 20" he acknowledges several of
my communications & informs me of his having received intelligence
of the copys which he forwarded having arived a t Alicant wherein
he informs the Consuls that the precaution I have taken is necessa
this in my opinion indicates thnt he placed no great co&dence in xi
promises of the most impotent Dey of Algiers, a t the same time he
expresses his expectation that the presents he has forwarded and the
Deys letters to tbe Bashaw will give a temporary security to our
~fiairsuntil1 our Frigates arrive in this sea, and adds that without
them & cash we cannot hold to our moorings in which opinion I perfectly wincide with him "He likewise observes that by making such
extraordinary co~cessionsta Tripoli will be the means of the other
R e g e n c ~incre
their demands upon us (to which ve me-leape
to add that by our urning aod sinking a few of their &isem it mll
not only be of service to us here but will in a great measure prevent
Tunis & &en+ from breaking with us, for I assure you none of them
hting; theIy] are only calculated to plunder) which I
am
are certain0 ~ 5 2 4be the case, for my ideas on this subject I refer you to
my correspondence with Mr OBnen which I presume he has forwarded to the Department of State and my dispatches since last
May - Mr OBrien informs me thnt the Swedish Consul a t Algiers
has wrote very pressingly to Sweden to prevent his King from ratifying Mr Tornquists agreement & says he is coddent that the Son of
Aly Bashaw will never get the stipuIatd cash & annuity, the Danish
Consul here has informd me that the Danes will never pay the annuit that Comodore Koefoed would have been here with a Ship of
the &e and some Frigates Ion ago to adjust this affair had i t not
been for their disturbance wi& Great Bntain which has been unfortunats for us, for I had arranged our affairs in such a manner that
the Danes would have adjusted theirs first, which would have
us a respite for several months, in which time no doubt I would ave
received instructions from the President, but their disturbance with
great Britain dersnged nll my plans and made us irnrnediateIy the
object of the Bashaws cupidity - The rest of Mr OBriens communications indicates that no coddence ought to be placed in either
the Dey of Algiers or the Bashaw of Tripoli in which sentiment I
agree with him most sincerely, & will take the libert to make a
triumvirate by adding the Bey of Tunis - Nothing append but
re ititions of what I have dread inform'd you until1 the 25* of April
w en I paid my respects to the nshaw in consequence of the Grand
Bairam or festival which occasioned my sending his Excellency a
letter with a translation in Italian enclosure NQ 1, my motive for so
doing was to counteract n report that Bryan MqDonogh had raised
that I have received orders from government to adjust the affairs of
the United States with the Bashaw, but that I would not through
personal enmity to his Excellency, & to endeavor to prolong the time
untdl I should receive certain intelligence from Malta of m Circulars
havin srrived of which I have forwarded upwards of orty since
last ebruarg On the 30* of April I received an answer from the Bashaw through
the organs of Farfm which infom'd me that he had desired him to

and London On the 9': of May Morad hoisted the coilors of all Nations on board
his Ship in consequence of the Bashaw & his Sons going on board of
some Vessels in the harbor, two Flags of the United States were hoisted
on the fore top mast stay where Prize Collors are hoisted & under the
Neapolitan flag,a nation at actual War with this Regency, I immediately sent my Drogoman to wait untill the Bashaw came on shore and
desired an Audience, the Bashaw answered that he was sea sick, and
desired him to tell me to make my communications to Gddi Mohammed Daguize & he would send me an answer by the same person I
accordingly waited upon him & requested he would ask the Bashsw in
my name whether he was at War with the United States, if he answered
in the afbmative I requested to have leave to embark my family
immediately, if in the negative I demanded that the person who had
dared to insult our Flag without orders should immediately be
punish'd - The Bashaw answered that he had given no orders to
hoist the Flag forward, that as et he was at Peace with the United
States, he than orderd all the ags to be haul'd down immediately,
and desired Ciddi Daguize to inform me that he was determin'd to
settle his affairs with the United States immediately that if we arranged, I should have satisfaction, that if not he would take down our
Flagstaff next day, this seems to me sdlicient evidence that the Flags
were hoisted by the Bashaws Orders - Ciddi Daguize infom'd me
thnt the Bashaws great objection was to the length of time, that if I
would agree to give him the promised cash & presents for eight
months time only that their yet was a probability of adjusting this
affair, I informd him that I should be deceiving the Bashaw was I to
promise him that answers could arrive in that time, & after five
different discussions I told Daguize to inform the Bashaw that I
would give him the presents & cash stipulatsd; for him to state his
demands to the President and to wait one year for his answer, Daguize
made the report and infom'd me that the Bashaw had rejected my
ofler, & was determined upon War u n l w I enterd into a negotiation,
"to alter the Treaty & promise the annuity were stipulated as the only
means of accomodation, that the sum probably might be reduced
considernbly providad we
eed to the said, but if War was declared
that he would ask a much arger sum" I answerd that he might ask
what he pleased but that it was a p w e whether he would get it, and
negatived the whole - In the evening Siddi Daguize sent for the
Danish Consul Mr Nissen, who is intimate with me, and desired him to
try to persuade me to make a spontaneous offer of forty thousand
dollars & the presents for the Bashaw to wait ten months for tho
Presidents answer - but that ho would advise me to try, and that I
might depend upon his influence, I requested Mr Nissen to inform
Daguize that I was aurprized be should send me such a message after
what I had informd him so often in the presence of Fmfara, that if
the peace of the United States depended upon reducing the time to
ten months, that I was ready even to mako that sacrifice, but that i t
was entirely out of m power to increase the sum in cash,let what would
be the consequence;itis N k n returnd $info&

had given orders to take down our Flagstaff in the morning, & Ciddi

Daguize and endeavor'd to settle upon the terms of esterday but
without effect nothing took place but repetitions & ding a War
inevitable I endeavor'd to form a precedent in this Regency, and
demanded and obtained a promise from the Bashaw that no captures
should take place untill forty days after declaration of War; but I do
not believe he is sincere & for that reason have not mentioned this
circumstance in my Circulars, lest it might be the means of g i v 3 my

fellow Citizens a security that does not exist nor ever will un
have three or four of our Frigates stationed constantly in this river of
thieves; but I think we are in no great danger as I have forwarded so
many Circulars since February last, that the fault of our Consuls in
not publishing them or the obstinacy of our mariners in comeing to
sea after receiving information can only be assign'd as reasons for even
a probability of any of our Vessels f a h g into their hands Monday ll*? The remainder of yesterday and part of to day I got
in as many of our passports as possible, their yet remains four whch
I am &raid I will not get, Morad has absolutely refused to give his up,

Tripoli as 'I was convinced the Bnshaw wanted to justify his conduct to

The President from a respect for your character & a desire to secure
to the Public the Services of a gentleman so well qualified for Naval
Commander, is anxious that you should avail yourself of an opportunity now afforded you of being retained under the Peace Establishment act Commodore Dale wants a Captain on board of the President;
and although i t may appear to you to be a retrogade motion, to act
in Subordination to any officer on board the same Vessel with yourself,
I hope when you reflect that there is no intention on the part of
government toward your feelings, you will have no hesitation in
accepting that command. Had you arrived in this country a few
weeks earlier, another arrangement might hare been made for you
which however will s t i l be made after your roturn from the Present
cruise Your reporting yourself to Comodore Dale will be agreeable to me:
your not doing it however will be attended with no circumstance,
prejudicial to yourself [NDA. OSW,Vol. 5, 1801-1802.1
Extract from letter to William Eaton, U. S. Conaul, Tunis, and Richard O'Brien,

DEPARTMENT
O F STATE,Washington, May 20, 1801.
"The proofs which have been given b the Bashaw of Tripoli of
hostile designs against the United States ave, as you will learn from
Commodore Dale, determined the President to send into the Mediterranean a squadron of three frigates and a sloop of war, under the command of that officer. Should war have been declared, or hostilities
commenced, this force will be immediately employed in the defence
and protection of our commerce against the piracies of that regency.
I t is hoped that the contagion will not have spread either to Tunis or
Algiers; but, should one or both of them have followed the perfidious
exam le, their corsairs will bo equal1 repelled and punished.
' ~ %policy
e
of exhibiting a naval orce on the coast of Barbary has
long been urged b yourself and the other consuls. The present
moment is peculiar y favorable for the ex riment, not only as it is
a provision against an immediate danger, ?I ut as we are now a t eace
and amity with all the rest of the world, and as the force emp oyed
would, if a t home, be a t nearly the same expome, with less advantage
to our marinem. The President has, therefore, every reason to expect
the utmost exertions of your prudence and address, in giving the

I

measure an im rossion most advantageous to the chsrscter and
inkrest of the nitod States. I n effecting this object, the means
must be left, in a groat degree, to your knowledge of the local and
other circumstances, which cannot be understood a t this distance.
You will, of come, take due pains to satisfy tho Bey, that the United
States are desirous of maintaining peace with all nations who are
willing to live in peace; that they frave e v e n abundant evidence of
their disposition to cultivate tho frieridship of the Barbary regencies,
and of himself in particular; and that, if the flag of the United States
should be engaged in war with oither of them, it will be a war of
defence and necessity, not of choice or provocation. You will also
give every friendly explanation and assurance, on this occasion, which
may be requisite lor the consuls and agents of other Powers residing
&tTunis.
"You are autholized to inform the Bey of Tunis that a vessel is now
preparing to take in fhe cargo which will complete the regalia due to
him, and that no time will be lost in getting her on her voyage."
(NOTE.-The same was written to Mr. O'Brien, except the lnst
paragraph, with the following addition:
"You will, of course, take due pains to satisfy the Dey that the
United States are desirous of maintaining peace with all nations who
we willing to live in peace; that they have given abundant evidence
of their disposition to cultit-ate the friendship of the Barbary regencies,
and of himself in particular; that they expect from his good faith an
efficacious interposition, according to our treaty with him, for guarantying the treaty with the Bashaw of Tripoli.
"The United Stabs, it appears, will, before you receive this, be
three years in anears to the Dey. Towards making up the deficiency,
the George Washington is under active preparation to carr timber and
other stores, for a t least one annuity. Commodoro Da e is charged
with thirty thousand dollars, which the President hopes the De may
have been induced to accept as a commutation for the stores &e for
another. He has also in chnlge four hundred yrards of cloth and
thirty pieces of h e n for the biennial presont. Sl~ouldyou not have
prevailed on the Deg, and should find it still impossible to prevail on
him to accept the t h t y tilousand dollars in lieu of the stores, without
the application of four, five, or six thousand dollars, you will be suplied with that sum; m d the sum of thirty thousand dollars will then
6 0 made up out of other moneys in the commodore's hands. Should
there be no possibility of inducing tho De to the measure, even with
this aid, the whole sum of thirty thousan dollars is to be retained b
the commodore. The bnlanco for the remaining, or third year,
bo sent as soon as i t can be done, either in stores or money, as may bo
agreod. You are already aware how much both the con~enioncyand
intarest of the United States will be promoted by substituting money
for stores, rating the latter a t thirty thousand dollars, as a permanent
regulation, and wilI take due pains to bring about such a change.
You may find it, perl~nps,nn fugument of some weight with the.Dey
for preferring money to stores, that tho former can always be renutted
with more punctuality, and that, in times of war, such of the latter as
are held to be contraband by the Europoan law of nabons, may be
exposed to captures by which he must be affected as well as tho United
States. I n case you should succeed in the pecuniary commutation
proposed, i t wilI be proper, in d e f i n i i the sum of thirty thousand
dollars, to refer to some standard of welght and fineness in the metal,

that will secure the United States
t arbitrary regulations of the
Dey, and quiet his jealousy, if he s ould have any, of imposition on
the part of the United States. The Spanish dollars now in circulation
may, for example, answer this purpose.
"The pretensions set up against the United States, in the case of
the ship Forficne, for indemnification to the owners of the merchandise
with which she was laden, show the disadvantage of employing our vessels in the freight of Algerine property. You will, therefore, as far as
you can, discourago that branch of trade; and, as far rrs it cannot be
done, will take care to repress all expsctation or claim whatsoever, to
throw on the United States the losses by capture under their flags.
"One sub'ect of equal im rtance and delicacy still romains. The
sending to &nstantmople t e national ship of war the George W d ington, by force, under the Algerine flag, and for such a purpose, has
deeply affected the sensibility, not only of the President, but of the
ople of the United States. Whatever temporary effects it may have
ty is of so serious a nature,
ad favorable to our interests, the ind
that it is not impossible that it may
deemed necessary on a fit
occasion, to revive the sub'ect. Viewing it in this T h t, the President
wishes that nothing may e said or done by you t at may unnecessarily preclude the competent authority from animadverting on that
transaction in any way that a vindication of the national honor may
be thought to prescribe.")

To Captain Richard Dale, U. 6. Navy*,or Ofacer Commending the America Squadron in the Mediterranean, from Samuel Smith for Acting Secretruy of the Hevy

[WAEHINGTON,
D. C.]
ATavDep $0 May 1801
SIR!The United States being at peace with all the world, Congress
assed a Law,during their last session, providing for a Navd Peace
Establishment, by which the President is authorized to keep in mnstant service, a proportion of the Navy of the United States.
Under this authority, he has directed that a squadron, consisting
of the F ' ates Presided, Philadelphia & Essex, & schooner Enterprize shou d be fitted, prepared & manned for a cruise; and relS;Pg,
with the utmost confidence on your knowledge, bravery & &h
reputation as an Officer,he has confided to you the command thereof.
One great object expected from this Squadron is, the instruction
of our young men: so that when their more active services shall herethe honor of
after be required, they may be capable of defen
their Country. I t is parhcularly requisite, that t ey should be
made acquamted with the coasts & Harbours of the Mediterranean,
where their services in all probability will fre uently be required.
Recent accounts received from the Cons of the United States,
employed near the Regencies of Algiers, Tunis & Tripoli, give cause to
fear, that they will attack our commerce, if unprotected, within the
Mediterranean; but particularly such apprehension is justified by
absolute threats on the part of the Be of Tripoli.
Under such circumstances, it is t ought probable, that a small
squadron of well appointed frigates, appearing before their Ports, w i l l
have a tendency to prevent their breakmg the Peace which has been
made & which has subsisted for some years, between them & the
United States. I t is also thou ht that such s Squadron, commanded
by some of our most gallant &cers, known to be stationed in the
Mediterranean, will give confidence to our Merchants, & tend greatly
to increase the commerce of our country within those Seas.
I am therefore instructed by the President to direct, that you proceed with d possible expedition, with the squadron under your command, to the Mediterranean. It will be proper for you to touch a t
Gibraltar & obtain permission from the Governor for depositing Provisions there, for the use of your squadron. I t is not presumed there
will be any refusal; but should he deem it improper, you wdl then
leave a letter with Mr Gavino the American Consul, for the Captain
of the Provision Vessel, that will be sent hereafter, directing him
where to proceed.
On your arrival at Gibraltar you will be able to ascertain whether
all or any of the Barbary Powers, shall have declared War against
the United States. In case all are tranquil, you will water our ships,
O'Brien,
proceed off the Port of Algiers & send to the Consul
whom you will inform that ou have arrived - that the views of
our Government are erfec y friendly - that ou have a letter for
& the Dey - an that you request to see
: or that he send

one year's annuity - and you have on board the Presided, Thirty
l be
thousand Dollars, which i t is hoped & expected Mr OBrien d
able to induce the Regency to receive for another year - the balance
may go, some time hence - But if Mr OBrien cannot induce the Dey
to receive money instead of Stores, you will retain the thirty thousand
dollars, excepting 4 or 5000 Dollars, which on Ma OBrien9srequisition
may (if he should think i t useful to commence with) be given him on
your arrival, & which amount may be replaced, if the Dey shall
afterwards agree to receive the 30,000$ in full for one year's annuity,
out of the 10,000 dollars heareafter mentioned as b e i intended for
the Bey of Tripoli - And the stores will be sent as soon as possible.
When your business is arranged a t Algiers, to your satisfaction, you
will proceed to Tunis & there cause the letters you ca to be delivered

President - the whole or such part thereof as you may have on your
arrival a t Tripoli, & which Mr Cathcart may conceive useful, will
be given the Bey, provided he has conducted himself peaceably

You will be careful not to sollicit the honor of a salute from any of
those Powers; if you do, they d l exact a barrel of Powder for every
gun they fire You will enjoin upon your Officers & men the propriety & the
utility of a proper conduct towards the subjects of all those Powers a ood understanding with them being extremely desireable ghould you find the conduct of the Bey of Tripoli, such as you may

But should you find on your arrival a t Gibraltar that all the
Barbttry Powers, have declared War against the United States, you
will then distribute your force in such manner, as your judgment shall
direct, so as best to protect our commerce & chastise their insolence -

by sidking, burnin or destroying their ships & Vessels wherever you
shall find them. $he better ta enable you to form a just deterrmnation, you are herewith furnished with a correct state of the strength
& situation of each of the Barbary Powers. The principal strength
you will see, is that of Algiers - The force of Tunis & Tripoli are
contemptible, & might be crushed with any one of the Frigates under
your command.
Should Algiers alone have declared War against the United States you d
lcruise off that Port so as effectually to prevent any thing from
going in or coming out, and you will sink burn, or otherwise destroy
their ships 8: Vessels, wherever you find them.
Should the Bey of Tripoli have declared War (as he has threatened)
against the United States - you will then proceed direct to that Port,
where you will lay your s h p s in such a position as efFectually to
prevent an of their Vessels from going in or out. The Essez &
Ederprize $y cruising well on towards Tunis, will have i t in their
power to intercept any vessels which they may have captured, - By
disguising your ships, i t d l be some weeks before they will know that
the Squadron is cruising in the Mediterranean - and give you a fair
chance of punishing them.
If Tunis alone or in concert with Tripoli, should have declared
War against the U States, yon will chastise them in like manner, -by
cruising with the Squadron, from the small Island of Maritimo near
the Island of Sicily, to Ca e Blanco, on the Barbary shore; you may
effectudly prevent the orsairs of either from interrupting our
commerce in the material part of the Mediterranean sea, & may
intercept any Prizes, they may have made Any Prisoners you may take, you will treat with humanity and
attention, and land them on any part of the Barbary shore mcst
convenient to you. This mode will be humane & will shew that we
have no sort of fear, what such men can do -It will also tend to bring
those Powers back to a sense of Justice, which they owe to us. But
you will be careful to select from them, such Christians as may be on
boayd, whom you will treat kindly, and land when convenient on some
Chrptian shore - Should you have occasion, you may accept t h q r
semces.
Upon applications for convoy, when you can afford it, you will
collect as many American Vessels as possible, & not by giving Convoy
to one or two only, expose the rest to capture.
Although our Nation has suffered as much as any other by the abuse
of Neutral rights, & is therefore desirous that these rights should be
more justly defined & efEcaciously protected, yet in the present divided
& wavering state of mind in the Nations interested, we do not think
we ought to go to war, in favor of either opinion: We, therefore,
recommend to you, if s Public armed ship of any Natlon should require
to s e a r ~ h ~ a nMerchant
y
Vessel under your convoy, that you endeavour
to avoid it in a friendly way, by giving every assurance which may be
reguisite & true as to the cargo of such Vessel: but if notwithstanding
thls, the search be insisted on, you are to suffer i t to be done without
resistance by force - but this is not to extend to the armed Vessels
of any of the Barbary Powers, or the Privateers of any Nation, which

6

468 -

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1786 TO 1801

are in no case to be permitted to search a Vessel under your convoy:
not however without every discreet & friendly endeavor, in the c m
of such Privateers, to dissuade them from their attampts, before resort
be had to force.
But in all cases of clashing with the Vessels, O5cers or Subjects of
other Powers, we enjoin on you the most rigorous moderation, conformity to right & reason, & suppression of all passions, which might
lead to the commitment of our Peace or our honor. We shall scrupulously & without indulgence, examine that conduct which shall b m g
us into collision with any other Power -: yet we do not mean that
you are to submit to unequivocal insults or wrongs - : and particularly
you are not to suffer your own ships to be entered - or your men
examined or taken out, a t sea, by any person or power whatsoever;
but to resist such attempt to your uttermost, yielding only to Superior
force, & surrendering, if overcome, your Vessel & men, but never your
men without your Vessel.
In your treatment of the Vessels, Citizens & Subjects of all Nations
a t Peace with us, you will bear in mind, that we are a t Peace & wish
to continue in Peace with all Nations - and that the commander of
a n American squadron, ou h t to be as much distinguished for his
attention & adherence to a the rights of humanity & hospitality, as
by his firmness in support of the honor of his country.
I t is expected that the Port of Gibraltar will be open to your
s uadron. I t is not doubted but that you will be received with hospit a 'ty & friendship in the Spanish Ports of Carthagena, Barcelona
&F the French Port of Toulon - a t Leghorn & Naples, Palermo &
Syracuse - Nor is i t conceived that there will be any obstacle made
to your entering the Ports of Malta, now in possession of the British.
Letters will be written on this subject to our several ministers & to
our consuls in the Mediterranean, & other convenient Ports, to enable
them to give proper explanations, & to enjoin on them the attentions
& Offices they may be able to render the expedition.
A credit will be established for the use of the squadron, a t the
respectable house of J Mackenzie & A Glennie of London: by whom,
your bills (or in case of accident, the Bills of your Successor in command) will be paid. You have three copies of a letter from this
Department to Mess" DeButts & Purviance of Leghorn, directin
them to accept your bills drawn agreably to the direction you w d
receive from the Accountant. - one of which send from Gibraltar the other send as occasion may require - and the third keep to 've
you credit where you may go - M: Gavino American Consu a t

It is ro er to inform you that the credit fixed for you in London, on
which eI! utte & Purviance will draw, to re lace the amount of our

which sum it is expected will be more than sufficient for a squadron
every way so well appointed & provided. The Purser of your ship,
will pay over to the Purser of the other ships, under the requisition of
their respective Commanders, the mor~iesthey may deem necessary
for the use of the ships they command - Perhaps a few thousand
dollars of this credit, may be usefully employed with the Barbary
Regencies; if so, you are a t liberty to make use, a t your discretion, of
four or five thousand dollars, in that way.

Thomas Jefferson, President of the United States of America, to the

GREATAND RESPECTEDFRIEND:
The assurances of friendship
which our consul has given you, and of our sincere desire to cultivate
peace and commerce with your subjects, are faithful expressions of our
dispositions; and you will continuo to find proofs of them in all those
acts of respect and friendly intercourse which are due between nations
standing, as we do, in the relations of peace and amity with each
other.
At the conclusion of our treaty with you, we endeavored to prove
our respect for yourself, and satisfaction a t that event, by such demonstrations as gave you then entire content: and we are disposed to
believe that, in rendering into another language those e ressions in
your letter of the 25th of May last, which seem to imp y purposes
inconsistent with the faith of that transaction, your intentions have
been misconstrued. On this supposition, we renew to you sincerely
assurances of our constant friendship, and that our desire to cultivate
peace and commerce with you remains firm and unabated.
We have found it expedient to detach a squadron of observation
into the Mediterranean sea, to superintend the safety of our commerce
there, and to exercise our seamen in nautical duties. We recommend
them to your hospitality and good offices, should occasion require
their resorting to your harbors. We hope their appearance will give
umbrage to no Power: for, while we mean to rest the safety of our
commerce on the resources of our own strength and bravery in every
sea, we have yet given to this s uadron in strict command to
conduct themselves towards all frien ly Powers with the most perfect
respect and good order; it being the first object of our solicitude to
cherish peace and friendship m t h all nations with whom it can be
held on terms of equality and reciprocity.
I pray God, very great and respected friend, to have you always in
his holy keeping.

that is due to your excellency's dignity and character, and should
recommend the squadron under my command to your hospitality
and good offices. I leave to the consul of the United States the task
of explaining more particularly the friendly dispositions of the United
States towards your excellency, the proofs with which he is charged
of their desire to maintain the treaty between the two Powers, and
the reliance of the President on similar dispositions on your art; for
myself, I only make use of the occnsion to assure your excei?lency of
the sensibility with which I shall experience y o u friendly countenance
and accommodations, and of the sentiments of reverence and exalted
esteem with which
I have the honor to be, your excellency's obedient servant.

To Bufna King, U. 8. Mnister to London, England, from Secretary of State

DEPARTMENT
OF STATE,
Washington 21 May 1801.
SIR:For a considerable time past suspicions have prevailed that a
rupture with the United States was intended by the Bashaw of
Tripoli Of late the alarms and proofs have been such as to impose
on the President the obligation of making immediately the most
effectual provision within his authority for the defence and protection of our Mediterranean commerce m case it should be attacked
from that quarter. At the last session of Congress six frigates were
directed by law to be ke t as a peace establishment. Out of this
force three frigates and
a sloop of war have been equipped and
will sail for the Mediterranean in a few days under the command of
Commodore Dale. Should war have been declared or hostilities be
actually commenced against our trade, tILis force will be employed in
the most effectual m m e r for its safety. Should the means, which
have been or may be employed to obviate the necessity of such an
application of the force, be successful, the squadron after cruising a
sufficient time in the Mediterranean, perhaps, if circumstances should
not render i t unndvisable, as far as the Levant and towards Constantinople, will return to the United States. The expedition will by
this means be not without its use, whatever may be the state of things
on its arrival; It will have the e$mt from which so much advantage
has been promised by our Consuls and others of exhibiting to the
Barbary powers a res ectable specimen of the Naval faculties of the
United Stabs. I t w& exercise our mariners and instruct our officers
in the line of their service, and in a Sea which it may be particularly
useful for them to understand; And as they form a art of the pence
establishment the measure will add but inconsiderab y to the expence
otherwise to be incurred. The United States being now also happily
in Peace and Amit with all the European Powers, the moment IS
more favorable in t a t view of the subject.
The President has thought proper that this earl information and
explanation should be given to you, that being ful y possessed of the
causes and object of the expedition you ma guard aiinst any misconstruction or misrepresentation that may y posslb ~ t be
y attached
to it and moreover prepare the Government where you met to lend
to the Squadron such hospitalities and accommodatiox~sin rts Forte
or elsewhere as opportunities may claim and as it would be imcumbent
on the United States to reciprocate. The friendly disposition felt by

&

the United States towards En land justifies them in their confidence,
that no convenient proof of a &ke disposition will be withheld, and of
this friendly disposition you are authorized and instructed by the
President, on all proper occasions to give the most explicit and cordial
assurances.

[SDA. Dip. Cor., Inst. to Min. Bk 5, 1798-1800.1
to U. a. Consuls listed below, from Secretary of State
DEPARTMENT
OF STATE,Washington, May 91,1801.
SIR: The proofs which have been received of the hostile purposes
of the Bashaw of Tripoli having imposed on the President the obligation of providing immediately for the safety of our Mediterranean
commerce, he has judged proper to send to the coast of Barba a
squadron of three f ates and a sloop of war, under the cornmany of
Commodore Dale. T h e squadron will sail in a v e T few days from
this date. Should war have been declared, or hostihties commenced,
Commodore Dale is instructed to make the most effectual use of his
force for the object to which i t is destined. Should the means employed by our consuls, and those which accompany this expedition,
for obviating such an event, be successful, the squadron, then, after
cruising for some time in the Mediterranean, perhaps, if circumstances should not forbid, into the Levant, and towards Constantinople, will return to the United States. The expedition will, by this
means, be not without its use, whatever may be the state of things on
its arrival. It will have the effect, from which so much advantage
has been promised by our consuls and others, of exhibiting to the
Barbary Powers a naval force from the United States. It will exercise our mariners, and instruct our officers in the line of their service,
and in a sea where, more than any other, their services may be wanted ;
and as they form a part of the peace establishment fked by law, the
measure wdl add but inconsiderably to the expense that would otherwise be incurred. The United States being also happily a t eace with
all the Powers of Europe, the moment is the more favorab e in every
view that can be taken of it.
The President has thought proper that you should be furnished
with the information here I v e n , in order, first, that you may be ready
to &ord every friendly and useful accommodation that occasions may
admit, to the squadron, or any part of it: secondly, that, beingpoaeessed of the objects of the expedition and the considerations which
led to it, you may be able, by proper explanations, to revent its being
misunderstood. The United States persist steadfast y in their desire
of living in peace and friendship with all nations who will permit
them; and on all occasions where assurances to that effect can be
proper, you are authorized to make them in the most satisfactory
manner.

ship (Now in compleat order for Sea,) and presented to you my
r e p t e r of all her materials received and expended, from the moment
of taking the command a t New York, up to her present outfit, together
with the indents for stores in every department for an expedition of
twelve months, with my orderly book, form of quartering the crew,
mode of working, reefing, handing, fighting, kc, &c, &c.
I have little to add furthur than to assure you, of my best disposition to render ou any assistance you may require, as to the arrangement for the overnment of the Squadron after its departure from
hence, and to make you acquainted with the qualities of the President,
whoes best trim is two feet difference of draught by the stern, when
she is about one whale down in the water a midships, if more than
one whale is sunk the difference should not be so much by two or
three inches, if less than one whde is in the water as aforesaid, i t
should be a little more.
This ship sails very fast by the wind, large, & before it, especially
if the breeze is fresh, she is lund and good humoured in a gale of wind
a t %a, but as i t seldom blows so hard that such a ship cannot carry
her close reefed Main & Fore top sails when every other sail is handed,
I advise your never heaving her too unless a gale is so violent as to
obhge the taking of those sails in; for certain it is that while ou can
keep steerage wa on a ship by carrying this canvass,she will ow the
sea and go stea ' y along by the wind; and on the contrary if you
heave too and es ecidly under a low sail, there is no vessel but d
fall off more or ess, and by etting in the trough or between two
m o u n t a h of seas, the low sa' will m the hollow get becalmed, and

hence i t is that ships labour and accidents frequently happen, that
might otherwise be avoided by carrying tho canvass I have recommended, which by being more lofty is always full.
In the voilent tempest I experienced in September last, when so
many ships were dismasted and lost, British Men of War as well aa
others; I kept the President under her main & fore topsails close
reefed, and lowered down on the cap, and never lost a rope yarn or
met with the smallest injury, tho' the gale continued an uncommon
length of time.
The officers of this ship are generally well selected, and have been
taught to obey, you will no doubt keep them in similar order by strict
discipline & at the same time show them every sort of Kindness and
respect due to their rank & Stations. I shall now leave you my friend
and proceed to Norfolk, and hurry down the small balance of men
and Stores, that you are to be supplied with; the rest of the stores are
to follow to Gibralter as General Smith writes me, & for the mode of
conveying to you what remains of the 12 months Stores indented for
the President a transport will be taken up to receive them with articles
for the Squadron generally.
Permit me to wish you every success in the expedition you are
about to make, and that you may enjoy health and comfort while
performing it, that I shall again have the pleasure to see you return
at the end of twelve months, to our native Country, & with you
uninjured the finest frigate that ever floated on the waters of this

and from hence I consider there is no manner of risk, as none of the
Tripolitans ever come this length, consequently all that were in this
Quarter, have proceeded on their Voyages, and passed the Gut without any molestation, except two, which are not yet in readiness. The five sailors which I claimed as America.ns (in consequence of
their producing unto me proof of being Citizens of the United States)
that were on Board the English Ketch Albanese, brought into this
Port by pa,rt of her Crew, who rose upon the officers, have not yet
been given up, and as I find from good authority, that tho' they had
not entered on Board that Vessel, as they asserted to me from the
beginning, that they were pressed out of an English Privateer in which
they had engaged to do Duty, and besides that the Chief part of them,
had been concerned in the Mutiny I have resolved, should they in
the end be d e b r e d up to me, through the interference of our Minister
in Madrid, who has claimed them a t my request of the Spanish
Government, to send such of them as remain (for some I understand
have already run off from their confinement) to the United States subject to your order, that they may be Judged by the Lsws of their
Country, which I trust you will approve of, I shall forward you a t

concerned in the Mutiny and that they had entered on board the
Privateer out of which they were pressed. I can procure no alliviation of the rigorous uarantine imposed on
vessels from the U. S. but I am happy to say, have succeeded thro'
our Minister in Madrid, to obtain the revocation of a most unjust order
that was communicated here in the beginning of March last, to exact
from all the Importers of Spanish Colonial Produce by American
Vessels, since the Month of april 1799, the amount of foreign Duties,
which a t the time of Introduction had not been demanded by the
Collector of this Custom house, who i t would appear, did not understand the orders transmitted him, & consequently only recovered the
Same Duties as if the goods were imported by Spanish Vessles.
The sums which different Houses acting as agents for the Americans, were Called upon for, on this Score, amounted to above $65,000.but such powerful motives were alledged, that the Spanish

Thetis where they wish'd me a pleasnnt passage as they supposed to

the Bashaw of Tripoli to the Bey of Tunis, which I r e d & made sail
immediately steering a direct course for Cape Bon when I got out of

our departure landed my dispatch Np 6 at the Citty of Valletta and
24 Circular letters, MF England my correspondent there inform'd me
that a convoy
sail for England & Gibraltar in a few days and
that my dispatch $ letters should he forwarded with the greatest
dispatch. I then shaped our course for the west end of Sicily and on
the 29 inst was boarded by a Tunisian Galiot belonging to the Sahib

an other on board of us, who made me open all our trunks tumbled
all our cloaths, but took nothing from me, but a Damizan of Malaga
wine some fowls vegetables & fruit, but from the vessel they plunder'd
several articles among which was t l ~ eCaptains Octant, Chart, cSt only

SIRAS I find several of my fellow Citizens in this Port who seem

I conceive it my b u t g to inform them through our OfEice of the actual
force of that Regency which was ready to s on the 24" Ultp and of
the Consequences attending the Capture of any of them. First. Should any of our fellow Citizens be unfortunatdy Captured,
they will be Kept as Hostages in order to force our Government to
comply with terms who1 incompatible with the honor and .Interest
of the U: S: and which {am of Opinion our Government wdl mlmt

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1786 TO 1801

Second. If on the Contrary our Fellow Citizens should defeat them
and sink two or three of their Cruisers they will render an essential
Service to their Country, as we shall be enabled thereby to conclude
a Peace with Tripoli upon our own Terms; and the other Regencies
will pfobably be intimidated in some measure from breakmg with us. Thrrd. The Bashaw of Tripoli has pawned all the honor he has that
he will not Capture any of our Vessels, until1 the expiration of forty
Days, to commence from the fourteenth of May; but I am persuaded
that if his Squadron falls in with any of our Vessels even before that
Period expires, that they will Capture them, and if they are valuable
they as certainly will be Condemned; nevertheless I recommend our
Countrymen to act upon the Defensive on1 until the expiration of said
Period; but should the Tripolitans fire the &s t Gun to exert themselves
to the utmost in order to inspire those People with a high Idea of
American intrepidity, and to realize the Idea which I have already
inspired them with "that Americans were a superior Race of Men to
the Castrate" of Naples, and that they would never take any of our
property without its being h t disputed to the utmost
4*!' The actual force of Tripoli ready to sail on the 24'b of May was
first: The Admiral an American Built Vessel, Coppered, Deep Waisted,
Yellow sides, with a white streak, muzzles of Guns red, looks Paltry,
Green Stern, with Flowers festooned above the windows Painted
white, and a White Woman head; heavy Riggin, and looks a t a distance
like a Spaniard: She is Commanded by Peter Lisle (alias) Morad
Raize an English Renegade, mounts 18 nine pounders on her main
Deck, six fours on her Quarter Deck, two Bow Chases, and two
Stern Chases, which are placed in such a manner that the Taffril is
cut down very Low, and 1s a good mark to know the Vessel by; she is
manned with 200 Men, and Carries 28 Guns. - Second a Swedish
built Bark Ship which is fitting out at Malta, and is to carry 150 Men
and 20 Guns 6 Pounders. - A Swedish built Brig which is fitted up
in a hurry and carries 14,4. Pounders and 120 Men, has a great sheer
aft and has the Johannes Von Bork, painted above her Cabbin

T W N IJune
~ , 28,1801.
SIR:On the night of the 18th instant a fire broke out in the Bey's

alace, which, in its progress, consumed fifty thousand stands of arms.
!he second day following, I received a message to wait on the Beg
but was a t that moment confined to my bed with a bilious fever, sd
that it was not till this morning I have been able to go in my carriage
to the palace. The Bey's object in calling on me was to demand of
the Umted States ten thousand stands of a m . I refused to state his
demand. "I have proportioned m loss,J1said he, "among my friends,
and this falls to you to furnish. $ell your Government to send them
without delay." I t is impossiblel said I, to state this claim to my
Government. We have no magazmes of small arms ; the organization
of our national strength is m e r e n t from that of any other nation on
earth. Each citizen carries his own arms, always ready for battle.
When threatened with an invasion, or actually invaded, detachments
from the whole national body are sent, by rotation, to serve in the
field; so that we have no need of standing armies, nor depositories of
arms. It would be an affront to my Government, and an imposition
on the Bey, to state to them this demand, or to flatter him with a
prospect of receiving it. "Send for them to France or England," said
the minister. You are in a much more eligible position to make this
commission to Europe than we are, said I. "If the Bey had any
intention of p u r c h q the asms from Europ~,"said the minister,
"he could do it without your agency. E e did not send for you to ask
your advice, but to order you to communicate his demands to your
Gopernment." And I came here, said I, to m u r e ou that I wilt make
no such communication to my Government. "%he Bey wiU write
himself," said he. If so, it will become my duty to forward his letter;
but, a t the same time, it is equally obligatory on me to let the Bey be
aforehand apprized that he never will receive a single musket from the
United States. I should suppose a sense of decency, if not of gratitude,
would dissuade the Bey from this new extravagant claim. Has he

492

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1786 TO 1801

not, within eighteen months, received two large ship cargoes in
regalia? have we not now another ship laden for him on its passage?
and has he not, within sixty days, demanded cannon extraordinary of
the United States? At this rate, when are our payments to have an
end? "Never," said the minister; "as to the ship you talk of, they are
but the part payment of reg& you have long slnce owed us, as the
condition of peace; the other claims we make are such as we receive
from all friendly nations once every two or three years; i t is an established custom, and you, like others, will be obliged to conform to it."
When we shall have completed the payment of our peace stipulations,
you may never calculate on further donations. I t is by treaty considered as the conditions of a perpetual peace, and any new claims on
your part will be a t least an infraction of the treaty, and will be eo
considered by us. You ma ,therefore, at once, and forever, abandon
the idea of future claims: or I again assure you, in the name of my
Government and country, that the discharge of our treaty obligations
will put an end to our contributions here. "Your contributions, as
you think proper to call them," said the minister, "will never have
an end. If this be the language you think of holding a t this court,
you may prepare yourself to leave t h e country, and. that very soon."
If change of style, on my part, s a d I , be the condition of residence
here, I will leave the Bey's liingdom to-morrow morning. "We will
give you a month," said the minister. I ask but six hours, I replied.
"But you will write?" No. "But it is your duty to write." For
deficiency in duty this is not the place where I am to be questioned.
"I tell you again," continued he, "your peace depends on your compliance with this demand of my master." If so, said I, on me be the
responsibility of breaking the peace. I wish you a good morning.
k v i n g the place, I heard the minister say to one of his colleagues,
"By God, that man is mad! but we shall bring him to terms; never
fear." I do not know how this affair will end. I will not change my
position.

D ~ S I RI,am happy to i[n]form you that the Bills drawn upon t,he

that the King of Sweden has determined to send a squadron against
Tripoli as soon as his sffairs with great Britain are arranged, every
pains has been taken to keep this Intelligance secret, lest it might
arrive a t Tripoli & injure their captives, but I have i t from authority
that precludes the Probability of my being deceived you therefore
may depend upon its truth & I trust d l make use of i t in such a
manner as will be most likely to promote our Interest without Injuring the unfortunate - By the last Posts from London (Via Hambur)

they are actually in the hfedeterranean, the same letters informs us
that (if rumor is to be credited) the government of the United States
have resolved to pay no more subsidy's (they are ashamed of the name
g Tribute, thank God) to the Barbary States, - if Algiers is
inclu ed in this resolve i t will be pulvk fulminans [?] for the nostrils
of the Villanious Sanhedrim & their Patriotic Secretary prudence seems
however to dictate the Necessity of our adjusting our acctq with
Tripoli first, which I hope will be the means of obtainin respect a t
Tunis, if not we must procure it a t the mouth of our annon but
should we break with tho whole of the Barbary States a t once we must
have considerably greater force in this river of Thieves. I purppse
chastizing them one a t a time & propagating reports & pursuemg
measures a t the Ottoman Court which will effectually prevent a
coalition to the detriment of ourinterests, In my last letters I informed
you that I do not merely contemplate to conclude an honorable &
advantageous peace at Tripoli no Sir more must be done, we must
establish a nahonal character in B a r b a q by effecting a revolution in
favor of Hamet the Bashaws Brother who ~sa t T m , for so long as
Joseph Bashaw lives, our commerce mill not be secure, allowing that
we conclude a peace upon our own terms; the first time our frigates
are off their guard or employ'd upon other service his cruisers will capture Americans in retaliation for haveingimposed upon him terms which
he may consider humiliating, not reverting to the cause, and that the
concessions he will certainly be forced to make (If I am empower'd
on the service in conjunction with the Commodore) are merely
Inflicted as a Just punishment for his want of faith & to oblige him
to observe his promises Inviolably Sacred In future - I therefore
request you to give me what Information you are master off upon the
above head, and how far you can engage said Hamet in an expedition
of that nature, should we not succeed in dethroning Joseph Bashaw
his presence on Board of Comodore Truxton would stnke such a
pamc in to 1Js brother which could not fail to be subserverent to our
Interest I need not mention that the greatest secrecy on your Part is
necessary The Ship Venture Cap! Loring of Boston has arrived a t Genoa a
o in twent one days from Lisbon & met with none of the
Tri days
h e quadron ihee mounts twenty Guns - When I tauch'd
few
a t alta I Inform'd Mr England, that our Frigates were actually
arrived & that I was going to Malaga in quest of them, I likewise
requested bim to place every obstacle in the way of the Tripoline ship
that was fiting out there & if cash could procure an entire suspension
of her outfit that I would be responsible for a moderate sum to be
employ'd upon that Service It appears to me that this news has
been made publick upon the arrival of Morad Raiz st Malta, which
Join'd to the reports which had been circulated a t Tripoli & the
Bashaws being inform'd that, I had alarm'd our commerce six months
before the declaration of war took place, has Intimidated the said
Morad & his brother Pirates from cruising to the Westward & that
they will cruise to the Eastward for a month or six weeks & return to
Tripoli & say their are no American Vessels out in consequence of my
precautions, god send this may be the case if Truxton has not arrived
but if he has I could wish it Quite other otherwise - as you In all
probability will hear of his arrival before I shall, please to request him
not to put any confidence in any person whatever a t Tripoli even
should the Bashaw hoist a flag of Truce & by no means go on shore,

In sight of Gibralter, spoke a French Squadron of three sail of the Line
bound for Cadiz if the English will let them; there is not one English
ship of war, a t present a t Gibraltar, on the Arrival of the Squadron
under my command in this port every attention was paid by the
Goverment. - Mr Gavino the Anerican Consul came on board %
I went on shore with him and waited on the Governour who received
me very politely - strange as i t may be to relate, but not the less
true, on my arriva1 here, I found laying a t Anchor here, the high
Admiral of Tripoli, in a ship mounting 26 Nine & six Pounders 260
men - & a Bngg of 16 Guns 160 men he has been out 36 Days, he
says he is not a t war with America, nor has be taken any Vessel he
came in here for water, he is under Quarenthe a t present [word
illegible] I get my Information from the Consul) - he arrived here
the day before the Squadron, what a pitty we did not arrive a few
days sooner for his sake, from every Infermation that I can get here
Tripoli is a t war with America, i t is our Joint opinion that the Admiral
is going to t,he Western Ocean, to capture Americans, i t would have
been a fortunste thing, to have fell in with him at Sea,so fully perswaded
am I that he intends to capture American Vessels that 1 intend to
leave, Caps Barron in the Philadelphia to watch his motions, - that
I s to take him when he goes out, he can Rave no Letter of friendship
from, Mr Cathcart, I understand, that he left Tripoli five or Six days
before the Admiral sailed, this said Admeril is a Scotchman, which
makes him the more to be dreded in our Seas. - I am Very sorry
to say our Barbary affairs look ve gloomy -long before you receive
this, you must have received Mr 0 Sans and the other Consuls, infermations respecting the Business,it is much to be Lemented that the
Government has not paid more attention to the infermation that has
been received from that quarter I am fearful i t will cost the United
States many Thousand Dollars before things are put to rights; there
is ful Employment a t present in the Medeterranian, for all the Frigates
belonging to the United States. - I found on my arrival the Grand
Turk laded with stores for the Bey, of Tunis, she has, been here seven
weeks & a Brigg from Baltimore bound to Triest 5 or 6 weeks all fearful
of being taken by Barbary Powers, I understand there is upwards of
Twenty lor Seventy?] sail of Americans, laying at Barcelona, & Man
in other Ports all fearfull of being taken, you may depend there sha
be nothing wanting on my Pert to render them every possible assistance that Lays in my Power
I intend sailing from this place to morrow there is no time to be lost,
I shall take the &and Turk & the Brigg, with me, - as there is no
warter to be got a t Gibraltar, I dont think i t a good place to deposit
tho stores for the Squadron - Malags will be a more Proper Place. if the Danger is not to greate when the Vessel arrives a t Gibraltar, I
shall leave orders with Mr Gavino res ccting that business
I em happy to Inform ou there is E?'very possible harmony throughout the Squadron. - I gave found Cap! Jss: Barron of much semce
to me he IS an excellent officer - July 3'g I did not get to sea as I
expected, but shall sail to morrow, - this day I have had some conversation with the admiral myself I wint alongside of h i s Vessel, I
told him I was bound for Tripoli & had a letter from the President,
and a present likewise for the Bey, he told me it was very well he said
the Bey of Tripoli was not a t war with America I ask'd him the reason
of Mr Cathcarb leaveing Tripoli he answer'd that i t was his own fault
& said that Mr Cathcart was no friend to america -I ask'd him when

he was going to Tripoli, he said in two or three months, I told him I
would be glad if he would 60 on Board with me, that I wanted to have
some conversation with h m respecting his nation he said no, he did
not like to go on Board with me; I h d there is no depe[n]dsnce to be
put in what he says; nor would he go to M? Gavino's house, so fully
persuaded am I and the rest of the Commanders that he intends to
capture American Vessels, wherever he can find them, I think one of
the ships cannot be better em loyed than watch his motions, and et
hold of him if possible I s h a f proceed with all possible dis atch or
Algiers with the President and the Schooner Enterprize, t e &and
Turk is a heavy sailer & would detain me much Longer than I wish,
I shall give Caps Bainbridge orders to proceed with her with all possible dispatch for Tunis, from there cruise of[Q tripoli, should I not arrive
at Tunis before he is ready to sail from there but a t the same time to
consult with the Two Consuls - I am Informed that Tripoli has six
Cruisers out a t present, - it would be a good thing to get hold of
this Admiral he is a man of Great weight, he is married to the Bashaws
Daughter, I cannot conclude this letter without givein you a description of the Admiral's ship, she formerly belonged to oston She d
carry about 25,OO barrels of flower, the Brigg Sweedish built carries
her Guns on the upper deck, she cannot sail fast, I think the ship ma
sail fast Enough to catch our Merchant Ships, and would do muc
damage to our trade, if he gits in the Western Ocean - which I think
he intends he came in here for water, I hope Barron may be so fortunate as to get hold of him -

present and Commanding a Ship of 26 Guns, nine & six pounders
260 men, likewise a bri g under his command m[o]unting 16 Guns 160
men, he does not say wl ! ere he is bound to, but I have every reason to
beleave that he Intends to capture American Vessels, from that
conviction, and conceive that one of the ships cannot be employd
better, for the Interest of the United States than preventing him frome
making his esca e, - Therefore Sir, I give you orders to Lay of[f]
this port & watc his motions, and (act in such manner as your good
sence will direct) to take him when he comes out keeping in View a t
the same time, to keep such a distance from the Harbour that i t
cannot be called a Blockade, should you be so fortunate as to take
him, after keeping all the Principle Officers you will dispose of the
rest, agreable to orders received from the Secretary of the Navy, the
Vessels you will keep, and proceed with them to Algiers for farther
orders which I shall leave there with Mr Rich'! O'Brian the American
Consul, I have requested Mr Gavino to keep a lookout and know when
he sails he can see from the Rock weather he goes East or West, I
have given him order to dispatch a boat to you to give you Infermation respecting him, if you should see a Boat acoming you will hoist
English colours, should you receive infermation that he is gone to the
Westward, through the Straits mouth, you must follow him, if you
should be certain that he is gone through you must spend two or three
weeks in looking after him, not hearing any thing of him you will
make the best of your way to Algiers - but should he remain in this
Port you will remain as long as he does should you want water you
must get i t a t Tetuan After saying what I have, I leave i t to your own, good Judgement,
being on the spot you will be better able to judge how to act that it is

TANGIER
1P July 1801.SIR At the moment of receiving the honour of your Dispatch of
21* May, transmitted me by Mr Gavino, an opportunity offers for
Algiers [?] which I lay hold of to advise Commodore Dales arrival in
Gibraltar Bay the first of thii month, with the three Frigates under
his orders: - the Enterprise Schooner reached same anchorage on
the 26'? June, and Mr Gavino advises me the whole Squadron proceeded up the Mediteranean on the 4'p Ins; - I beg leave to say,
that this measure of Government, appears to me extremely likely to
be productive of the best consequences in your negotiations with the
Barbary Powers, and I sincerely hope i t wdl prove to be the case. As Commodore Dale met a French Squadron in the Straits, soon
after he passed this Bay, I had an opportunity of seeing his colours,
when reflecting that for some time back the Bntish Ships have chiefly
watered in Tetwn Bay, because of the scarcity at Gibraltar, I thought
it was probable, the Americans might have occasion to do the same;
in consequence of which I wrote the Governour of Tetuan, to say !t
was possible they might touch there, in answer he assured me,. If
they did they would not only be supplied with Water, but also with
every other refreshment they might ask for, and I am persuaded they

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS

509

would meet a similar Friendly reception a t every other Port of this
Empire. - Mr Gavino in his Letter of the 4''' Inst advises a Tripoline
Frigate of 26 Guns 246 Men, and a Brig of 16 Gum 146 Men then
lay in Gibrdtsr Bay, that the Commanders denied having any
authority to capture American Vessels; but I am sorry to say, I do
not believe it. - I understand the King of Sweden has not ratified
the Treaty made in January last with the Tripolines - The Consul
here has been advised so, but not OÂ£Eicidy. The British Consul returned from Court 22 last Month, it appears
he has not been able to obtain a reduction of the Duty on Cattle
exported from this Country for Gibraltar in general, only a special
permission to ship two thousand Head for the use of the Fleet &
Garrieon a t the former rate of five dollars, all others to pay fifteen.
Bulkely has not been able to execute Maley Soliman's Commission for Gun Carriages, which I am very sorry for; His Majesty was
extremoly pleased with my readyness in endeavouring a t obtaining

them. Thank God we continue to enjoy good health thro'out this Empire,
and having now passed the season of usud chief danger, it is to be

hoped we shall not be again visited by that terrible scourge the
Plague, this year. [SDA. CL, Tangier, Vol. 1, 1797-1803.1

LANCASTER
P+July 13'? 1801
SIR Samuel Hughes, Esquire, of Harford County, Masgland bas
made an application to me, on the Subject of a contract for Cannon
with the United States. I t took place in June 1794. As I acted in
relation with the department a t the head of which you are, I con-

sider i t rts most proper & regular to address you, knowing that my
letter can be used, as occasion may require, by the heads of the two
other departments, which were then contained in the Department of

War.

I am not satisfied that I ought to trouble you with any thing upon
this subject without your request, nor without a revision of the
papers or a statement of the matter on the part of the U. S. Mr
Hughes however was so desirous of a line from me, that I promised
to write to you by the mail of this Evening.
The offers for Cannon, which were made in my time, were produced, I think, by circular letters to the principal Iron Masters, and
applications thro the Revenue officers in all the States, where the
Furnaces and iron Masters promised a safe and good contract. I
think that of M' Hughes was the only one, which appeared, for some
time, to be worthy of acceptance. Another with Brown & Francis
followed. Gen! &ox appeared to consider the casting solidly, indispensible. M' Hughes feared the risk & cost. Gen! Knox would not
relax from that part of the obligation. Mr Hughes wished a positive
stipulation to be allowed for it. As the cannon, in either way, must
be bored, and as i t appeared possible, and even probable that the
iron bored out would do to fuse again, I wished the allowance to be
hypothetically stipulated. The discussions between Mr Hughes &
myself were transferd to the war Office, where Gen! &ox concurd
with me in the form of that article of the Contract. Mr Hamilton
happend to come in, & from my recollection, and one of the du licate
contracts shewn me on Saturday, I am of opinion that the fo o w e
words were introduced in conse uence of an appeal by Mr Hq [Hu hes]
to him. "It is further agree%, that if, on experiment, i t sha& be
"found impracticable to make Cannon u on the plan of cast'
them
"solidly they shall be cast in the usua Manner, but with pruce
"head as before specified." The execution of the plan of casting
solidly seems however to put this provision out of question.
Mr Hughes mentions to me a M: Foxall, whom I do not remember
ever to have offered. The idea of casting solidly came, I think, from
the Sec? a t War, & I believe his Notes or letters to me will shew it.
I think Mr Foxall was unlrnown to the Treasum in December 1794
when I declined the Service of procuring supplies for the army &
navy, or rather, I believe, for the navy from its interference with my
revenue duties and from a conviction that it was so contrould and
influenced by two heads of departments, ~ n by
d the Captains, Navy
Agents, &c"hat i t was extremely W c u l t to procure the adoption of

IP

economical & promising measures, and impossible to have them adhered to. A roper head of the naval department appeared to be
the only reme y, but at that time there was no disposition to separate
it from the general business of War affairs, nor did I venture to
suggest it. As my mllicitude about the military and naval supplies was very
great, I think it probable that much d be found on paper to explain
the rise, m d completion of the Contract with Mr Hughes. I, of
course, yield all that I remember, to be explained & controuled by
what is found in writing. I presume that httle of it remains in the
Rerenue Office: Some of the papers may be in your office, and some
in the late MF Francis's office IGAO. KO.12.531.)

under your Command to Barcelona in Spain In going there you will
keep a good lookout, and speak every Vessel you see, ~f you can without looslng too much time to know that they are not American Vewls
captur'd by Tripolian Corsairs or the Said Corsairs - I understand
there is from 25 to thirty sail of American Vessels laying a[t] B&rcelona,
and many more in the other Ports, along the Coast of Spain, in !he
Medeterranean waiting for convoy to see them safe out of the Struts,
on our arrival a t Barcelona, ou will make i t known to William
w&ijs E S ~the
! American consui?there, and the American Commanders,
that you have come to give them Convoy out of the Straits, you will
impress on the minds of the American Commanders, that they must
not loose time in giting thew Vessels ready for sea, I suppose it will
take them 4 or 5 da s to get ready, and you to water your ship &c You will write to t e American Commanders or the Consuls in the
different ports along the Coast, that may have any American Vessels
in them, to hold themselves in readyness to join ou as you goe down
the Coast I suppose Mc W2![i]s will be able, near y, to inform you, the
number of Vessels that is, m the diierent rts waiting for convoy
at any rate you will make your self as wePoacquainted as possible,
the number of American,Vessels that wants convoy, and give them
every protection that is-m your Power, as it is out of my power to
say or know what situation the Vessels may be in, or how many that
may be ready for sea, on your arrival a t Barcelona therefore I leave
you to act, agreable to circumstances and as you find t h g s situated
on your arrival there knowing that you will act for the best for the
Interest of your Country and to the best of your Judgement - You
are to take no Vessels under your convoy but Amencans and should
you be met a t sea by a Pubhck a m $ ship of any of the European
Nations, that may wish to search any shxp, or ships, under your Convoy,
you will then act agreable to the Copy of my Instructions from the
Secretary of the Navy that X ave y ~ uon

When you anive off Gibra tar with the Convoy you will send in
your boat to know from Mr Gavino if he knows what is become of
the Tripolian Admiral if he has reason to think that he has got past
Cap1 Barrwn and gone in the Western Ocean - you will then see the

be no American Vessels there that wants your Protection up the
Mediterranean gou will proceed to algiers from there to Tunis from
Tunis to Tripoli; or rather off Tripoli; it is to let those powers know
that we have a force in those seas - There is no necessity of anchoring at any of those places i t is much better to stand of[f] and on, if
you want to have any Communication with the shore, should there
be American Vessels laying at Gibraltar wanting your protection you
will give it as far as you think i t necessary, but in no case higher up
than Leghorn you are not to understand, that you are to go about
convoying one two or three Vessels the Merchants cannot expect any
thing of the kind when we have objects of more consequence in View,
for the general good of our Country but at the same time it is my
intention, as I well know i t is the intention of the Government of the
United States, that every protection (that is consi[s]tent) by this
Squadron, s h o d be given to the commerce of the United States in
thoes seas - On your arrival off Gibraltar as at first directed should
M' Gavino not be able to give you any infermation respecting the
Admiral you will see the Convoy clear of tbe Straits and act as if you
had returned from Lisbon My Cruising ground will be between Tunis and Tripoli and off
Tripoli, when I want water I shall go to Maltar for it, I t being the
most handy place for that purpose I expect I shall be in Gibraltar
about the middel of October by that time or before the provisions for
the men will be expended - I shall be guided by that altogeather,
when your convo-yng business is over you will be able to form some
Idea where to find me - You may inform Mr Will[i]s that I shall take
Barcelona in my way to Gibraltar As it is Impossible for me to tell how long you -41 be on this Convoy, business nor is it possible for me to foresee what situation you
may be placed in Likewise the Infermation that you may receive
whde you are absent from me, which makes it necessary for you to
deviate from the above order therefore, Sir notwithstanding what I
have said should you find i t necessary to deviate from the above
orders you have my concent so to do alway's keeping in view the
honor and Interest of your Country, and the good of the Service You have nine hundred Dollars on Board your shi , put on board by
the Goverment of the United States for the use o the said ship, but
should you meet with any accident or from any other cause, yo?
should want more money before we meet again - I have a credlt

the business of the present of Jewels has been arranged at as small a
sacrifice as possible - By the last advices from Mr King it is probable that they have before now arrived a t Tunis. If you have saved

the reserved portion consists of, in order that they may now or on a

that we have rec* very ample details from him of his proceedings
with the Bashaw of Tripoli up to the 13" of March, and that we are

on the appearance of danger from Tripoli - We hope that the timely

were put on board to fiU up the Vessel, under the opinion, that they
would bt! acceptable to the Regency & at the same tlme turn out as a
favorable article of Remittance - IT9 2 contains a portion of the
Articles you designed for distribution on the arrival of the Timber,
and No 3 some articles procured for the Bacre's and not sent last year.
These last kticles they rcre to pay for - If on the arrival of the
George U'ashington s t Gibralter it shall be found, that we are at War
with Tunis & at peace with Algiers, the Ship Peace & Plenty which
sails under her Convoy with the last Cargo of the Regalia for Tunis,
is to proceed to Algiers & deliver the Cargo to you. It 1s expected that
the Dey will in that Case be willing to take it a t a favorable Valuation - should he refuse it the Peace & Plenty must proceed to the
nearest & most suitable Neutral Port & gel1 it on Acct of the U States,
but as it consists of articles which are considered by some of the
Beligerent powers as contraband, i t is in no event to be sold in the
port of a power a t War. Tbe President has not yet fixed upon a
suitable character to succeed ou in the office of Consul General;
but his decision will not be de ayed longer than the tune when the

At Anchor in Tunis Bay 19'' Jdy 1801
SIR,My Letter to you of the 3r.dInst from Gibraltar Informs you
the Desternation of the Squadron under my Command from this
place, I had a Tedious passTe of six days to Algiers Owing to head
winds and Calms, on my arnval a t Algiers on the 9* Ins! Mr OBrian
came on Board, before we came to Anchor, the Cap! of the Port came
with him they Prointed out the proper place to anchor the ship Mr
OBrian Informed me that the Dey of Algiers had be[en] complaining
very much of the United States in not making their anual payments
good, and had gone so far, as to say that he would not put up with it
much longer, he was now confident he said, that the Dey would not
speak so big and would pay more attention to what he said, - he
was confident he said, that the arrival of the Presided a t Algiers had
much more weight with the Dey than if the [George] R7ashing60n had
arrived with stores; I think they must be a dam$ sett the whole tribe,
Algereans Tunisians and Tripolians there is nothing that will keep
there avericious minds in any degree of order, and prevent, them from
cornmiting depredations on our commerce whenever thay May think
Proper, but for the United States to keep constantly four or six
Frigates in the Mideterranean, without that, there is never any
security for our commerce Mr OBrian told me he did not think it was
a proper time to mention to the Dey -about receiving thirty Thousand
Dollm in Lieu of stores; he said if it was mentioned at the present the
De would conceive that the [George] Washington was not a Coming
an that Government of the United States ment to fore the money,
by the force of armes, at present the Dey was statisfyed with what he
had been told respecting the Intentions of the President, and i t was
beat to let him remain so (he has got no Corsairs out nor is he a fitting
any out) Mr OBrian said if the [George] Washington was arrived, he
thought with the money and the stores, there might be s prospect of
doeing something he advised me to land the money as i t would be
safe, that he might have it ready when the [George]Washington anived,
to t q what could be done with the Dey, I told him I had no discretionary power respecting the money, and could not land i t without
the intentions of the President being fully carried into effect but if
he wanted 5 or 6 Thousand Dollars he mlght have it, he told me he
would think of it, - I told him I would keep the money on Board,
and when I returned perhaps somet
could be done with it, then to
advantage, he said i t was very well - e took the cloth and Linen on
shore with him, Mr OBrian is not in a good sttlte of health at present,
but he says the arrival of the Squadron m the Mediterranean, he thinks
will make him well a t any rate he could die with much more ease he

should loose no time in gitting there On the morning of the 11%Inst the wind blowing Very fresh f[rom?]
the E N E and a high sea setting in the Bay of &ern, I did not Like
my situation much, then at anchor in 30 Fathoms water; double
reefed the Topsails and made every preparation for GiGng under way
hove short to about 45 fathoms of cable the ship began to drift with
the anchor, a t 6 a. m. found it necessary to cut the cable to save the
Ship a t 8 A. M. Cleared the topsails down, to close Reef them, the
maul and four topsails split to peaces the ship is very bad off for top
Sails - The Bay of Algiers is a bad place for ships to anchor in L
dont think I &alI ever let an anchor go there again - from Algiers I
Proceed for Tunis but had a very Teadious passage owing to the same
cause as before, - 1 arrived in Tunis bay the 17 Ins! Sint a letter
on shore to Mr Eaton, the 18+ he came on board, - The Essez and
ship Grand Turk arrived the same day -from Mr Eatons Infermation,
this Regensy has been much in the same way as Algrers, and the a p
pearance of our ships, will have the same effect on the Great and
M' hty Bey of Tunis ~ s h refer
d you to the Letter of hlr Eaton by the same conveyance
as this; for every Infermation respecting this Regensey who will I am
confident eay every thing that is necessary, he appears to be a very
proper person for 5 Consul a t such a place he seems to feel for the
honor of his Country - In fact from the Letters that I have seen,
none, of them seem to be deficient in that respect, Respecting Mr
Cathcart Consul for Tripoli you must have received his Letters before
you can receive this, Infor
you of his being a t Leghorn, and the
reason, in fact every particu ar respecting Tripoli - from every
Infermation that I can get I dont understand that the Corsairs of
Tripoli has taken any American Vessels, I most sincerely hope that is
the Case, I shall proceed from this to morrow for Tripoli taking the
Enlerprize with me, my spirits will begin to flag if I dont fall in with
some of the Tripolian Corsairs soon - Should Ca Barron, have
been so fortunate, as to have taken the Admiral it wil be a great ste
towards making a peace, on our own terms with the Bey of 'I'ripof
a t any rate I shdl not like to come home without bringing a sample of
those great people with me, I am sorry that I am under the necegsity
of sinding Cap+Bainbridge in the Essex to Barcelona to convoy 25 or
30 sail of American Vessels that is laying there & many more in other
Ports waiting for a convoy to see them Clear of the straits, it is to be
lemented that there was not two or three more Frigates sent out a t
the time those was sent - to have given that rotection to our Cornmerce which is so necessary in those seas, a t e present time - In
five or six weeks I shall be under the necessity of Proceeding to Gibraltar for Provisions I hope the store ship will be sent out in time If Ca 5 Barron Joins me soone, (which I hope he will and bring the

er's boat's crew* he dispatched one of the most distinguished megad- of his Court to cause them to be released and to order his Coast
guards to have particular respect for the Americans - Yesterday
morning I had audiencs a t his Palace, And delivered him your letter
wi!h an ItaIian $anslation. He seemed highly flattered with its
Stlle; but I could &ern some uneasiness in his countenance which he
endeavored to concad, but which discovered itself on my return from
the Palace to the City. A person of confidence a t court, and much in
my friendship, came to advlae me that Tripoli was actually famishing
for bread, $ that she depended alone on tunis for Supplies. He intimated that applications would be immediately made by this Government for my passports of Safe conduct for Several Vessels which were
now taking in thew Cargoes for that place - In order to evade such
an application, And with a view of profiting of this weapon toward
tho enemy, I instantly circulated Among the foreign Agents here
Exhibit A. of the inclosures sending ;at the same time a Copy of the
Bey's prime Minister - I t produced convulsions a t the Palace All
commerce here is monopolized by the Gov*-The chief Commercial
Agent waa sent to my house with a particular request that the blockade
m g h t be so modified as not to effect the interests of this Regency I answered that however desireable such a modifkation in respect to
our friendship with Tunis might be, i t could not be acceded without
defeating the intention of the blockade Tripoli had made war against
us in violation of the most Sacred faith and honor - She ought
previously to have taken into calculation all the possible consequences
of such a Step - And if our friends Suffered a artial and temporaw
inconvenience from the Dispositions we foun ourself compelled to
adopt to punish the outrages of our enemy it was but the commqn
effect of war, and ought not to give umbrage - Some time passed m
discussion. The Agent grew agitated, and said he was authorized to
assure me that Adherence to this position would endanger our pssce
with Tunis. Here I appealed to the good sense of the Bey; observing
that I felt a confidence that he, the Bey, would never so far depart
from the established and acknowledged maxims of war as to demand
of an Agent of a nation a t war passports to furnish the means of
defence and Subsistence to an enemy. He demanded a letter from
me recommending to your Clemency a Vessel laden with wheat already
departed and another on the point of departure for Tripoli - T h
I refused on the General rinciple - He proceeded to menace my
personal Situation. I to1 him I was prepared for 811 events but the
censure of my Government - He demanded "Are you then d e
cided?" Necessarily so. said I - He left my house in a *mostviolent
rage and immediate1 forbade the imbarcking of promions I had
made for the Grand urk, observing as he went out that indemnit
would be claimed of the U. S. for any damages which might res t
from this Step - To which I replied that this would then h m e an
Article of discussion between the two Governments, which, a t the
present crisis, could not be debated. To day I received a Note B. from His Britanic Majeste's Agent To which I answered C.all of which I Submit for your approbation.
Thus, Sir, I have blockaded Tripoli at Tunis without consulting you,
because this, with many other things, the want of time and pressufe
of Affairs let Slip my memory. I trust, however, the emergency mll

justify the expedient. It is certainly the most distressing blow which
a t this moment we have the power of inflecting - & f e n is a weapon
lawfully employed to vex an enemy - I cannot doubt therefore but
this measure will obtaih your approbation and Support. - Tripoli
is in great distress - Her Corsaires are all a t Sea. She is S t , d g
in her Capital; And will be thrown into consternation a t your unexpected appearance. - If this position, which the good providence of
God gives us, can be Sternly held a few months Tripoli will be compelled to ask pence on our. own terms - The object is so desirable
that it soems worth exertions - more especially so as Algiers and
Tunis are looking to t.he issue of this rupture as precedent for their
intercourse with the United Statcs COPY*The boat's crew hnving landed at Xiarsa, site of ant Carthage, an

WASHINGTON
CITY,

Wednesday, November 18, 1801.
Naval Victory
Yesterday captain Sterrct, commander of the schooner Enterprize,
part of the Mediterranean squadron, arrived here, with dispatches
for the Secretary of the Navy.
Captain Sterret is the bearer of dispatches from commodore Dde,
which exhibit a detailed account of the proceedings and situation of
the Mediterranean squadron.
On the 1st of August, the schooncr Enterprize, commanded by
captain Sterret, and carrying 12 SLYpounders and 90 men, bound to
Malta for a supply of water, fell in with a Tripolitan cruizer, being s
ship of 14 six pounders, manned by 80 men.
A t this time the Enterprize bore British colours. Captain Sterret
interrogated the commander of the Tripohtan on the ob'ect of his
cruize. He replied that he came out to cruise after the mericsm;
and that he lamented that he had not come along side of some of
them. Captain Sterret, on this reply, hoisted American, in the room
of British coIours; and dischar ed a volley of musquetry; which the
Tripolitan returned by a partia broadside.-This was the commencement of a hard fought action, which commenced cbt 9 A. M. and
continued for three hours.
Three times, during the action, the Triplitan 8ttarnpted to board
the Enterprize, and was as often repulsed with great sku hter, which
was greatly increased by the effective aid afforded by t e Marines.
Three times, also, the TripoLitan struck her colours, and rte often
treacherous1 renewed the action, with the hope of discrbling the crew
of captain terret, which, as is usual, when the enemy struck her
coloure, crune on deck, end exposed themselves, while thoy gave three
cheers as a mark of victory.

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS

539

When for the third time, this treacherow atfrtck was made, captain
Stemet gave orders to sink the Tripolitan, on which a scene of furious
combat ensued, until the enemy cried for mercy.
Captain Sterret, listening to the voice of humanity, even after such
perfidious conduct, ordered the captain either to come himself, or to
send some of his officers on board the Enterprize. He was informed
that the boat of the Tripolitan was so shattered as to be unfit for use.
He aslred, what security there was, that if he should send his men in
his own boat, they would not be murdered?
After numerous BU plications & protestations the boat was mnt:
a n discovered to be in the most deplorable
The crew of the ~ r i ~ o E t was
state. Out of eighty men, 20 were killed, and 30 wounded. b o n g
the killed were the second lieutenant and Surgeon; and among the
wounded were the Captain and first lieutenant. And so decisive was
the fire of the Enterprize that the Tripolitan was found to be in a most
perilous condition, having received 18 shot between wiud and water.
When we compare this great slaughter, with the fact that not a single
individual of the crew of the Enterprise was in the least degree injured,
we are lost in surprise a t the uncommon good fortune which accompanied our seamen, and a t the superior management of Captain
Sterrett.
All the officers and sailors mnifesbd the truest spirit, and sustained
the g w t e s t efforts during the engagement. All,therefore, are entitled
to encomium for their valour and good conduct. The mariues,
especially, owing to the nearness of the vessels, which were within
pistol shot of each other, were eminently useful.
After administering to the relief of the distresses of the wounded
Tripolitans, and the wants of the crew, Capt. Sterrett ordered the
ship of the enemy to be completely dismantled. Her masts were
accordingly all cut down, and her guns thrown overboard. A spar
was raised, on which was fixed, as a flag, a tattered sail; and in this
condition the ship was dismissed.
On the arrival of the Tripolitan ship at Tripoli, so strong was the
sensations of shame and indignation excited there, that the Bey
ordered the wounded captain to be mounted on a Jock Ass, and
paraded t h o ' the streets as an object of public scorn. After which
he received 500 bastinadoes.
So thunderstruck were the Tripolitans a t this event, and afi the
apprehended destruction of their whole marine force, that the d o r s ,
then employed a t Tripoli on board of cruisers that were fittin out
by the government, all deserted them, and not a man co!dI d be
procured to navigate them.

Opinion that Some force continued here even when P a c e is ebblished, as little dependance can be placed on the whole of them
remaining long on good Terms with any Nation,
The Bashaw of Tripoli is again a t v ~ i a n c with

nations, in conformit to your Instructions. The quarantine s t d continues to be inforced on all Vessels from the
United States, notwithstanding the repeated representations of our
Minister at Madrid for the orders regarding i t to be repealed, or a t

it would have been ortunate if he had taken this place in his passage
as there are five sail of our Vessels here ready to sail, but as they
have all armed & mean to sail tomorrow in Company, I presume we
have nothing to fear for them. The fortunate crisis which you arrived in, joined to the very judicious arrangement of the Squadron under your command seems
well calculated to g v e full security to our commerce, a t this period
we have not lost One Single Ship, we hnve their Admiral in our
power & our operations are not impeded by the contemplation of
having a number of our fellow Citizens in Captivity; We have every
opportunity of inspiring those Barbarians with an Idea that we
have not sued for peace through impressions of fear & that we will
not suffer our Flag to be insulted with impunity. I have no orders from Government. to treat with the Bashtlw
whatever, which I arn very glad of, as it gives us on opportunity of
acting upon the offensive, I beg lcave to suggest for your information
that when you are join'd again by the Essex or P h W l p h i a & should
your Ideas coincide with mine upon the subject; that the cruisers &
prizes belonging to the Bashaw may be easily destroyed in the Night
by the Boats of the Squadron, this would strike the Bashaw with a
panic & would be favourable to our interests in the other Barbary
States. - I should recommend you Sir by no means to trust your
person on shore a t Tripoli, to inform no person that you have either
cash or a letter from the President to the Bashaw on board, to enter
into no negotiation whatever, however delusive appearances may be,
as the Bashaw like Satan only flatters to deceive & is destitute of
every honourable sentiment which digdies the human heart; trust
no person whatever as you may depend that the agents of other
Nations are ashamed of their pusillanimous conduct & will oppose
us in order that the result may justify their own conduct, by our
being reduced to ns humiliating terms as they have reduced themselves to, unwilling that any Nation should enjoy privilidges their
bad conduct has forfeited; should you find it expedient to burn their
Cruisers in Port I should not wonder to hear of the Massncre of
Juseph Bashaw & i t is my unalterable opinion that no treaty ought
ever to be made with Tri oli, until1 its Government are made sensible
of their inferiority, until the Bashaw sues for eace and signs the
treaty with his own hand on board the Co~nmoore's Ship. This is
the period Sir to establish our National character with those pirates,
should we not embrace this opportunity i t is doubtful if ever we have
so favourable a one again, happy, extremely happy shall I be if my
sentiments coincide with yours m our plans of operation, should they
not "Nevertheless you may depend that I will most cordially coincide
with you in every thing which may seem likely to promote the interests of our Count to obtain the end contemplated by Government
in sending a Squa ron into this sea & to maintain the dignity of our
Flag. - I don't expect the Tripoline Admiral will leave G~braltar,
linpp should I be to see him on board the President, he promised to
enricg the Basllaw with the propert of our fellow Citizens, whom he
ht~dthe insolence to stile damn' rebellious Rascals, worse than
French Men, I imagine he was encouraged by his friends Lucas &

proper to send the Schooner for me, I am ready to embark in one

remain untill all our affairs are settled both a t Tripoli & Tunis. Nothing decisive can be done untill we receive fresh instructions from
Government, which I hope & presume will be a positive order to
make no Concessions. - We may expect to receive instructions
from Government in October; but i t is probable that nothing decisive
will be done untiIl after the meeting of Congress ns our Commerce
is perfectly secure & I conceive it

Says that Hostilities having commenced on the part of Tripoli Proceeded from the Conduct of Mr Cathcart [?], on Shore [?], Says every
thing Prejudical to his Character that malice could devise. this letter
drew from Commodore Dale Sundrey Questions Relative to an accommodation between the two Countryes, those Questions not be'
ointedly Answered & the Bashaw Still Continuing to send on boar
Ltters of a Trivial Nature the Commodore has refused to have any
farther communication with him & being inform'd that most of ~ E I
Cruizers were out, determined to continue off this place for Some time
to prevent their prizes geting in, & being in want of Water despatched
the Schooner Enterprize to the Island of Malta for the purpose of
Supplying the President with that article, & on her Passage to that
place met with a Tripolitan Cruizer A ship of Fourteen Guns &
Eighty Men, an action commenced which continued for upward of
three Hours when the Tripolitan was obliged to Strike, having all
three of her masts Shot away. Twenty nine Killed & Thirty wounded.
Lt. Steret Immediately Boarded the Ship and threw overboard, her
Guns Anchors Cables &c &c. and left her an entire Rack, with orders
to the Captain to proceed with his men to the Nearest land. Three
days after this took place we spoke the Ship under a Jurymast, the
Captain inform'dl he was from Tunis & had a few days previous, off
Malta fallen in m t h a French Corvet of twenty-four Guns & had got
damaged in the manner we then Saw him, this appearing to be a
plausible tale Commodore Dale give him a Compass & SuiTer'd him to
proceed on - It is with Pleasure I inform ou that Lt Steret in this
Action did not lose a single man, Either Ki ed or wounded, altho the
Ship attempted three different times to board him, Lt Steret & officers
conduct during this Action deserves the praise of their Country.

70 Men. the Eutineers made their Escape to the Barbeary shores,

Give them any more provisions the Admiral has ofred to sell out

it, this Letter was wrote by the request of the Bey to h o w my Intentions In coming off Tripoli, whether i t was to make war or peace, I
wrote him that my Intentions in the first Instance was friendly but the
act of his Excellency in declaring war against the United States had
put that dispo[si]tion, out of my Power & that I was determined to

I wished to be informed of, as soon as possible, that I might Inform
the President of the United States, and know his Determination
respecting the Business the next Day the Bey sent of[fj a Jew to negotiate for a peace or
Truce, I informed the Jew his Excellency had not Answered my Letter, I told him I was not Inpowerd to make a new Treaty, but if the

water so as not to be under the necessity of Quiting the coast of
Tripoli, to go Into port for water, but on her return back, I found she
brought so Little water, and that little so difficult to get out a t sea I
found that I should be under the necessity to go into port for water I n

After being 18 Days off Tripoli and seeing nothin in that time, but

Nuv: dep, 19 Aug! 1801.
SIR,TO correct certain erroneous opiniom - to introdurn a regular and respectful subordination - and
to establish an energetic Government on board of the
Ships of the United States - I have found it necessary

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS

to adopt, and to send forth the following Instructions,
which you will be pleased to consider as Rules of Conduct to you upon the point8 to which they relate. Ship of the United States, there must be
observed
In
y the Marines, as well as b the Seamen, a
ed Submission
respectful Subordination and an unqua&i
to the orders of the Captain or commanding OfEcer of
such Ship. All persons whatsoever on board, Marines as well as
Seamen, shall cheerfully, promptly and without any
appearance of hesitation, obey every order given by
the Captain or commanding OfEcer: and no person
shall on board presume to object to or in any mamncr or
form question the Propriety of any such order.
The Captain and other Officers of the Ship will consider the Marines as deserving objects of their regard
and attention as the Seamen; and they will not wantonly subject either the one or the other Corps to duties
which do not regularly appertain to their respective
Departments. Seamen are not to be ordered to do the
duty of Sentinels or to perform any of the other appropriate duties of the Marine Corps, and the Marines
are not to be ordered to go aloft or to perform any other
acts of mere Seamanship. To prescribe in detail to the Sea and Marine Officers,
their several and respective Authorities and duties,
with all the proper modifications, would, in practice,
greatly embarrass the Government of a Ship, & would
~nevitablytend to produce endless altercation, and a
consequent confusion, that would be seriously and extensively injurious to the Service. - And hence results
the indispensable necessity of committing, without restriction, the absolute and exclusive command of the
Ship to the Captain, or commanding Officer, who from
every consideration of Public good, and personal responsibility will be zealously interested in the Appearance the g;ood Conduct, the discipline and the happiness
of the Marines as well as of the Seamen. No Gentleman worthy of the honor of commanding
a Ship in the Navy of the United States, will ever be
ca able of an Act so abhorrent to the Principles of an
d o e r as to abuse this eat and important Authority.
If, however, there sho d ever occur, an instance of a
gross abuse of this power - such transgression will
upon a proper representation thereof, be a subject of
serious enquiry in this Department.
Marines before they are attached to a Ship, are under
the Command of the Lieutt Col? Commdt of the Marine
Co s: but after they are so attached, the command of
the 'eut Col? Commdiover them ceases, and from that
moment, the Marines, Officers as well as privates, are
under the command of the Captain or commanding
officer of such Ship. And the Marines so attached to
a Ship are not to be removed from her but by the order
of t b department; nor is any officer of Marines, so

?f

'E

558

hTAVALOPERATIONS FROM 1786 TO 1801
attached to a Ship, to obtain leave of absence upon
furlough, but by the order of the Captain or commandin Officer of such Ship or of this department. If a b a r b e on Board of any Ship of the United
States, should a t any time be desirous of becoming a
Seaman, and the Captain of such ship should be well
satisfied, from his ersonal knowledge of his Merits
that he deserves suc promotion, and also that such an
advancement would contribute to the good of the
Service, he is authorised to make such trapsfer and
promotion, subject, however, to the supemtending
Control & ratification of this Department. An Officer of Mnrines has no rank on Board a Ship of
the United States, over any of the OfiEicers of such
Ship. -

Frigate Essex came safe into our Bay, with Twenty three Sail of
Merchant Vessels principally loaded on the Coast of Catalonia for
different Ports in America, & the North of Europe, Cap! Bainbridge
proceeds the first moment of a favorable Wind, to escort his Convoy
thro' the Gut. By the last accounts from Gibraltar it appears the two Tripolitm
Crulzers remain blocked up by the Frigate Philadelphia, and that the
crews were deserting fast in consequence of having no provisions,
some had been fumshed by the Emperor of Morocco, & probably
more may be sent over to permit them attempting to get out, they
are however so closly watched that it will be a very difficult Matter to
escape tho Vigilence of Cape'Barron The Sickness which last Season raged with such violence a t Cadiz,

To MAJORPERKINS
MAGRA
His lSritanic Majesty'g Agent and Consul General
for the City and Kingdom of Tunis
SIR,I t is a disagreeable task the duty of my public trust imposes on
me to present to you and through you to his Britanic Majesty That a
certain Bryan Mwonough, by birth an Irishman, Physician to the
Bashaw of Tripoli in Barbary, actually charged with the affairs of his
Britanic Majesty in that Regency, has for a long time pursued a system of conduct in that regency hostile to the United States of America;
that he has been notoriously instrumental in stimnlating that Bashaw
to make war against the said United States; and that he is now not
only aiding by his counsel, the measures of offence and aggression
carrying into operation by said Bashaw against said States but is
actually planning and encouraging projects of an attack upon the
American squadron now before Tri oh in direct violation of the treaties
subsisting between his Britanic h ajesty and the Government of the
United States of America. For the support of these articles of charge
I pledge myself. Conduct in a public Agent so injurious to the
interests of my nation, so inconsistent with the faith and friendship
of our two nations, and so derogatory to the honor of the nation he
represents cannot but excite some sensibility an our part, and, I am
persuaded, will not escape investigation and punishment on yours But, what is most remarkable, Mr MFDonough is racticing these
injuries against us in violation of his private faith p&hted to us, a t
least so far as respects his neutrality in all our affairs w ~ t hTripoly, for
a pecuniary c o d e r a t i o n . This precaution, on our part, was taken a t
an early period of our intercourse with Tripoli because it was intimated
to us that this same Mr MqDonough was in the habit of raising a
revenue from the imbroils he had the influence to create between that
Bashaw and Christian nations by afterwards insinuating himself as a
mediator between the parties - You cannot be ignorant, Sir, that
this species of fraud is not uncommon to most of the half renegades we
see here., who from motives of gain, or fugitives from justice, abandon
a christian country & attach themselves to the service of these Barbary princes: I n this class of Speculators Mr MqDonough holds a
distinguished Chnracter.
'I pray you will have the goodness to transmit a copy of this resentment to such of his Britanic Majesty's Ministers as have the uperin-

Sep. 1. 1801 The foregoing is a copy of a remonstrance which I [Wlliam
Eatonl lodged in the British chancery office in Tunis the day of it's
date: which I also forward to the American Minister in London by the
same express which carries this to Gibraltar - Mr Cathcart has
always complained of him (MqDonough) and undoubtedly with good
reason, as a very meddlesome, misch~evouscharacter - But i t was
hardly to be suspected that he would presume so far as to act openly
in his hostilities against the United States - I have thought it my
duty to present h ~ m- Since M: Cathcart's departure from Tripoh,

2QSep. 1801
SIR,Day before yesterday arrived here in six days from Tripoli an
express vessel on her way to Gibraltar with a view of taking on board
and carrying to Tripoli Morad Rais the Tripoline Admiral and the
crews of the two corsaires which are supposed to be blocked in that
port. The vessel charged with this commission bears the following
discri tion - She is a Greek Polacre ship with a prow and her bowsprit ashed to it, her stem head about four or five feet high above i t
turning inward with a shoar from i t to the bowsprit outside. Two
guns pointed forward, one on each side of the foremast. Her quarter
deck raised about two feet above the main deck, running forward
something nearer the main than the mizen mast, with a crab upon i t A camboose house on the starboard side with an arched top, and
four remarkable stantions in front of it. Three streaks of her Bide
have been paid with Turpentine, but, this bein$ worn off, now appear
white. Her stern has four small window holes m it and below them a
carved moulding which has been broken on the larboard side and
mended but not carved; also the stern round moulding on the same

side intirely gone, the other side on - A stern ladder ha
g on one
side. Her forestay is covered with sheep skin with the woo outside Her constructions is long, low, and squat, though in ballast. Her sheer
something round and quick aft. Her stern high, having a reddish
appearance. Her equipage are chiefly Greeks from the Island of
Candid and speak no other language but the modern greek. She has
a pilot on board, a pale, meagre frenchman whose name is Jacques
Cortez, very much of a scoundrel, as you will naturally suppose from
the employ he is in, who speaks french and Italian and, I believe,
Turkish - She has a bill of health signed by Bryan MqDonough and
countersigned by Perkens Magra, british Consul, a t Tripoli and Tunis
She pretends to navigate with Ottoman papers: This may be the case;
but she is actually in the service of the Bashaw of Tripoli aiding and
assisting his offensive operations against the United States, and belng so
employed is liable to capture and condemnation even with or without
the Tripolines on board. I dispatch a polacre ship of my own, C a p
tain John Padwanni, being the only one here I can trust in this enterprize, to carry you this information in hopes that it will inable you to
get possession of the Tripoline Commodore and people. This would
be an event so fatal to the Bashaw of Tripoli that it would a t once
put an end to the war. He can do nothing without the crews of these
two corsaires - They are many of them from the first families of
Tripoli - this circumstance, if they fall into our hands, would excite
an insurrection in his Kingdom and give us the intire command of
terms - To secure this very important object the best method I
concieve, would be to let the greek vessel pass lnto Gibralter unnoticed
and recieve her passengers, to watch her departure and sieze her the
moment she is clear of the port: If she be permitted to pass over to the
Barbary Coast our design will be lost. The crews of these corsaires,
together with officers, are about three hundred and fifty men - I n a
desperate case they would be very apt to attempt boarding you; against
such an assault it IS presumed you are prepared. If you get possession
of the Commodore it is advisable to force from him an order to surrender you his ships - His own is a Boston built vessel of eighteen
nine pounders on her main deck, six fours on her quarter - two bow
and two stern chases - The other a Swedish brig of fourteen four
pounders - When you shall have executed this project proceed off
Tunis and, without making yourself known, give me notice. I will
immediately board you and lay before you a scheme I have projected
to decoy the B d a w of Tripoli into your ship - The prospect of
advantage to our affairs which will result from the success of this interprize seems so practicable and is so promising that I will not entertain a doubt of its taking full effect: I shall feel the utmost anxiety
until I hear of its operation - If you should have need of Captain
Padwanni to bring forward your prisoners, or any other service of
the Govt the ship is a t your disposition - I suppose it is hardly
necessary to caution ou to put your prisoners in irons, provided
ou catch them - Zom? Dale's last letter to me is dated 28. ult.
ft gives nothing interesting. The schooner Enterprize on the 19 Aug.
captured a Tripe corsaire of 14 guns & 80 men after an action of 3
hours - The corsaire had twenty men killed and 30 wounded The schooner nobody hurt - I cannot but repeat, if you get possession of the English renegade, Morad Rais, it d l decide our contest

ON BOARD THE Grand Turk
Road o j Tunis Sep. 6.1801
SIR,The inclosures which I have the honor herewith to forward
will inform Government, as accurately as I have the means, of our
actual position and future prospects in regard to Tripoli-one circumstance only omitted, which is a project in concert between the
rightful Bashaw of Tripoli, now in exile in Tunis, and myself to attack the usurper by land while our operations are going on by sea.These two men are brothers; the younger is on the throne having
expelled the elder about eight or nine years ago - The subjects in
general of the reigning bashaw are very discontented and ripe for
revolt; they want nothing but confidence in the prospect of success:
this confidence may be inspired by assurapces of our determination
to chastise this Bashaw for his outrage agaulst U. S. - The Bey of
Tunis, though prudence will keep hun behind the curtain, I have
strong reasons to believe, will cheerfully prompt the scene: He is in
favor of the elder brother. The Idea of dethroning our enemy and
placing a rightful sovereign in his seat makes a deeper impression on
account of the lasting peace it will produce with that regency, and
the lesson of caution it will teach the other Barbary States - These
are objects which, to me, seem so cleqly within our power that they
ought to command exertions - Havmg begun to coerce Tripoli 16

of State, together with this, will show how freequently we have occasion for dispatch vessels - I dare no! any longer confide in foreigners - it is very dangerous employmg my own on this service
mthout regular papers - I t is hoped these embarrassments will be
removed - If we do not succeed in arresting the English renegade,
I apprehend two or three bomb ketches will be absolutely necessary
before Tripoli - This however is a little out of my sphere of action Full support to our Cormnodore and dispatch in furnishing that support are so obviously necessary that i t seems superiluous to speak

hard - At 11 P M, the wind came from the WestwQ & very foggy lay to thro'
the night in the straits. Captain Barron proposed as we coud not get in Tangiers
to proceed to Tetuan & there deliver the provisions & also to enquire the news,
respecting the crews of the Tripolitan Corsairs, now moored in the Mole of
Gibraltar and dismantled.
At 6 the Philudelphia & Essex being off the rock of Gibraltar, the Philadelphia
made sail for Tetuan, The Essez laid off the rock, made the signal fixed on for
the American Vessels that were there in the bay of Gibraltar bound to the Eastward, and fearful of coming out on account of the Algeziras boats and my intention was only to give them convoy clear of the rock against those privateera

LEGHORN
Septemb: 7:? 1801
SIRWith infinite pleasure I received yours of the 25* Ultp, informing me of the capture of the Tripoline Cruiser [Tripoli], Mr Stemett
has behaved galantly, & has my warmest thanks for having so well
proved by demonstration that the idea I have endeavor'd to inspire
the Tripolines with of the energy of the American character was well
founded; continue Sir in the same line of opperation which you have
so judiciously pointed out, & be confident of a happy result, which in
all probability will not only insure a permanent peace with Tripoli,
but likewise prevent the rest of the Barbary States from imposing
upon us I can't help manifesting my perfect coincidence with M:
Eaton in the manner he has conducted our affairs a t Tunis relative to
the blockade of Tripoli, & would certainly have acted in the same
manner had I been in his place, even had War been the immediate
consequence; "the question a t this moment is" shall we be tributary
to Tripoli, & consequently to Tunis or not; if we act with energy &
perseverance we shall be respected, but the Nations that makes concessions are imposed on continually, & will continue to be treated in
the same degrading & humiliating manner they have been until1 they
adopt the same plans that we have; that is to repel their unjust
demands by force of arms, & I solomnl declare that if a peace could
be procured with the Regency of Tripo i for one hundred Dollars that
i t would be contrary to the interests of the United States to pay it Your idea of bombardin the Town is an excellent one, the eyes of all
Europe is upon your litt e Squadron, & I am certain they d l reflect
honor upon their Country & justify the idea already formed of
American valor & intrepidity
Enclosed I send you some abstracts from Mr Nissen's Letter with
my answers to them, if Mr Ingraham ever goes on board your Ship,
you will please to confine him on Board, to prevent him from insuring
the United States, & to answer for his past conduct - I hope efore
long that you will oblige the Bashaw to hoist a white flag; see Mr
Nissens letter to me & my answer Their is a Swedish built Dogger which navigates under British
colors & trades from Tri oli to Bengasi but is or was commanded by a
Frenchman; This Vesse is coverd by Bryan MgDonogh but is the
property of Murad Raiz the Tripoline Admiral, her motive for being
put under British Colors with a French Commander was in order to
facilitate the forwarding of dispatches from the Court of France to
Alexandria by the way of Bengasi & Derna, where many Vessels loads
upon account of the Bashaw & his Subjects; I should imagine should
you fall in with the Dogger she would be a good prize, the articulars
of her papers you will be able to ascertain by enquiring of %I r Nissen
in whose office they originated - Now Sir a person that would be
guilty of such an act of Treason to his own Natlon in consequence pf
a pecuniary reward, certainly would not hesitate to injure ours m
hopes of ingraciating himself with our enemies, & thereby reaping a
benefit, his venality is well Known by every Consul a t Tripoli
On the 2'3 & 3'9 ins; arrived the Ships Henrietta $ Serpent in 60 days
from Baltimore, & 13 from Gibraltar, they bring us intelligence that
the George Washington, & Chesapeak were a fitting out for the Me&terranean; & that they were boarded by a Lieutenant from the Philadelphia who informed them that the Tripoline Admiral & Consort

that the Philadelphia boarded every thing in the gut, this I suppose

here transcribe an extract from my letter to him of the lo* of July "Comodore Truxton has resign'd. Comodore Dale has taken the

for the iniquity of their Government Their is a probability of Denmark & Sweden shaking offf] the yoke

with the Ships of Sweden which I discouraged, as I have no idea of

When you enter the Bay of Tunis, you discover a Nnrnhr of bays and appearance of inlets between the different mountains & land, the similarity in their
appearance makes it difficult to know the entrance of Tunis. The best marks are,
nearly in the centrc of the great bay of Tunis, you will discover two high rugged,
cli8lted hills or smaU mountains, these make on the left side of the entrance to
Tunis, by steering for this mark you will soon discover Cape Carthage on which
stands an old ruin, resembling an ancient castle near which are several houaea that
are white & EM you approach Cape Carthage you discover several columns of
darkish color which are part of the ruins of the Ancient Carthage, you leave Cape
Carthage on your starboard hand, & when arriving there you see a large fortification & some houses which is called the Goletta 6 guards the narrow passage into
the bason of Tunis, which is 6 or 8 miles in extent to the City of Tunis, but only
navigable for small boats. The best anchorage for a frigate or Ship of War is

in exchange for all the Turks we had, which in number was forty one,
those people being disagreeable on board & Not Knowing what to

To Captsin Richard Dale, U. 6. Bevy, from Clement Humphreys, Algeciras, Spain
(24)
ALGECIRAS,
Sep?bPh 1801.
DEARSIR, A few days after your departure from Gibraltar, I had
the pleasure to receive your favor of the 4+ July. I hope sincerely,
that your cruize to the Eastward, has been attended with happy
consequences to the commerce of the U. States: and it must be very
evident, that the time1 appearance of such formidable Ship's, will,
in future, compell the arbarg Pirabs, as well as those in this neighbourhood, d d y to appreciate the American's; as for the Cruizer's
from hence, few of our Merchant Vessel's escape them.
I presume, that on your return to Gibraltar, you must have been
informed of the misfortune, that hns befel the Speculation's of Mess?
W. & Francis, in the Mediteranean; by the capture of three of their
vessel's, (MoUy, Sophia, & Joseph Wamj,) since that of the Amelia;
nnd of the unfortunate fate, that attended the &folly. The Sophia,
was more lucky, & escaped with the confiscation only of s few Chest's
of Tea, & some Candles: she sailed yesterday afternoon for Malaga.
The Joseph Harry, I am in expectation, will be liberated in the course
of the day; her Cargo, is composed of Carrtzcas Cocoa of a very
superior qualit , which I have recommended Cap: Montieth to sell
here; it wdl yi d a very handsome profit, as it will command 42 hard
Dollars onboard; so that her capture, which at first appeared unfavourable, will, in the event, prove very beneficial.
I m sorry to add, that the Amdia & Cargo, are still in the possession of the Privateersmen, nor has a single vessel here, that has
been captured by the Prench, been released notwithtmdjng the
Exchv of Ratification's, was eBected some time since, at Paris; such
detention, is painful & ruinous, & i t is still more aggravating, as we
have but little hope's of obtaining our enlargement, for tis some time
yet. Cap; Montieths destination was for Barcelona, with instructions
from Mess? W. & Francis, to secure a return Cargo from that place;
which he will be unable to accomplish, unless at a great disadvantage
by procuring the goods in this noighbourhnod: You wiIl tllerefore do
me an essential favour, by informjng me, if the risk from the Tripolian7swould be too great, to hwwd a voyage that way. There are
likewise, several vessel's here, who are in expectation of being freed,
that are bound up the Meditermean; but will not move higher than
M a l q a , untill they are certain of prosecuting their passage, m safety.
Any ~nformationthat you might be pleased to communicate this
way, would be very thankfully received.
CLEM,HUMPHREYS
P. S It was reported here, that the En#erprise, had beat off a Tripolitan ship of 20 guns: be so good as to let me know, the truth of this.

destroying all !he Barbary Vessels you mBy meet with, cruising with
hostile dispositions towards us; and also by recapturing any American
Vessels you may find in their possession. But if Algiers and Tunis
or either .of them, should have joined Tripoli in the Warfare, you
may posslbly find yourseIf too weak to face their United force. In
the Event of such a Junction therefore, I leave it with your discretion
to determine whether t q return immediately home or not - You
will collect such rnformation from Mr Gavino & others, as will enable
you to form a proper declsion upon the Subject. Not knowing whether you may find the Barbary powers in a State
of hostility with us or not, I cannot here rescribe the duration of your
Cruise. If you should find Captain Da e, you wiU obey his Instructions on this Subject: othernise you must determine for yourself, considering, should i t be indispensably necessary that you have libert
to s h y till the latest period for which your Crew is entered, whic
however, I. cannot suppose will be necessary.
To provide amply against every Situation in which you may be
laced, I have deposited a Credit of Â£1500 Sterling with Messn J
ackenzie & A Glennie of London, subject either to your drafts,
Commodore Dale's, or of MesswDe Butts and Purviance of Leghorn,
to obtain reimbursement for any draft you may draw on them or any
necessary Supplies you may procure from them. Should you touch
a t Leghorn you will call on those Gentlemen for any necessary Assist
mce, & deliver them the enclosed Letter.
I enclose two Copies of my Letter to De Butts and Purviance, one
of which you may forw~rdas you may find convenient the other keep
to procure credit to your Bills a t Malta, Minorca 8 cisowhere. You
will find no difficulty in m y of the ports mentioned, in procuring any
necessary supplies.
I have further directed Mf Ludlow to pay over to your purser 1000
dollars in Specie, for defraying small Expences a t Gibraltar, or
wherever else you may go. Should any of the Barbary Powers have made Captives of any of
our Citizens, you will endeavour t h o ' the Swedish Consul, to afford
them usual Relief & comfort; for which purpose you are authorized to
furnish from the Money you will have on board, or from your Credit,
what Sum you may deem necessary. Any Prisoners you may take, you will treat with humanity & attention, and land them on the Barbary Shore. This Mode will be
humane; and %illtend to brirlg those powers back to a Sense of Justice. You will be careful to select from them, such Christians as may
be on board, whom you will treat kindly and land them when convenient on some Christian Shore, or if you should have occasion, you
may accept their Sel-rices. Upon applications for Convoy when you can afford it, you will
collect as many American Vessels as possible, and not by givlng Convo to one or two only, expose the rest to Capture. f o u will wribe to me by every good opporturuty after leaving the

Honor to command, ,about seven Leagues to the Westwg of Malta
fell in with a ship n ed Polacre [the Tripoli] mounting 14 Guns

three Hours, the Corsair had 20 men killed and thirty wounded,
there wss not, a man hurt on Board the Schooner, she is tho only one
that has been seen at sea by the Squadron; on my arrival here I
found the T i p d i n e Admiral had laid up his Vessels and gone home
with the most of his crew, I came down here for Provisions Expecting
to have found the store ship here from America, with stores for the

bound up the Mediterranean, but was going to tuch a t this Place to
Inform themselves respecting the Barbary Powers to h o w if any of
them was at war with the United States, if there was to get convoy
if possible, by some of the ships of the Squadron I have wrote the
Governor of AIgiziras a Letter on the Business a copy of which I
send, you herewith - I m Informed that the King of Spain has
Declaired Gibraltar in a state of Blockade, becaus the English has
Blockaded Cadiz, with a fleet of Line of Battle Ships, js Spain to
take satisfaction on us, by taking our Merchant Vessels, becaus the
English has Blockaded their Port with such a force as they can nither
go in or out, the English can supply Gibraltar, when they please with
any thing the Ganison may want; that is not the Case with Spain, I say if the subjects of Spain is suffered to take our Vessels, that are
bound up the Mediterranean, and stoping a t Gibrdtar for Infermation with their Gun boats and Privatiers, that is Lurking about the
straits, Treating the Crews very Ill after they do take them, those
that they do not think proper to take rob & plunder them of their
necessary stores, - if the citizens, of the United States is suffered to
be treated in this manner by those srndl Gun boats & Privatiers of a
nation that protends to be in friendship; they had much better be
a t open war no court of Justice, agreeable to the Laws of Nations I
think, can say that Gibrdtar is Blockaded at present, ou are the
Best Judge of that, I can not persuad my self that the overnment
of the U S will suffer such proceedings long, Calmly - I shall Dispatch the Ederprize in a few Days for the U. States I shdl represent
it to Government in the strongeat light I can I am told the Governor has a particular Interest in the Privatiers,

GIBRALTAR
BAY,October 4, 1801.
"IInving completed my water on the 21st August, I sailed again.
On the 30th, I brought too a Greek ship from Constantinople and
Smyrna, bound into Tripoli, loaded with beans and merchandise,
and having on board one Tripolitan officer, twenty soldiqrs, foyrteen
merchants, five women, (four of them black.) and one w h t e chdd, all
Tripolitans. I took them a11 on board. I thought this a favorable
opportunit to try to bring about, and settle an exchange of prisoners
with the ey, should his corsairs take any Am~ricans,(I say God
forbid.) I accordingly sent three of the Tripohtans on shore, m a
smnl boat, with a letter to Mr. Nissen, requesting him to make the
conterlts of it known to the Bey. The next day, Mr. Nissen came off
nt the Bey's request, to know if I would make a truce. Mr. Nissen
informed me, that he had told the Bey before he came off, that he could
not, say m y thing to me on that subject, until he had answered m.v
letters on that point. The Bey told him to go off and try; and if I
would, he would then talk to me about the exchange of prisoners and a
peace. My mind was made up on that subject, knowing I had no
orders to make a truce, little was said on that subject. Mr. Nissen
told me, that the Bey mid, that he would not give one American for
all the soldiers, and that only eight of the merchants were his subjects.
He cared very little about any of them. At length the Bey sgreed

14

594

to give three Americans, for twenty-one soldiers, and three for the
eight merchants. Circumstanced as I was, I was under the necessity
to act as I did, namely, to put all on board the Groek ship again, and
permit them to go into port. I wrote to Mr. Nissen, to inform the
Bey, thnt I agreed to the exchange of three Americans for the soldiers,
but I did not consider the merchants as prisoners, nor could I fix on
any thing respecting them, until I knew the determination of my
government, and that the present transaction was not [to] be considered a precedent in any future negotiation. This transaction took
place on the 3d September, the shp's company then very sickly,
ninety-four on the doctor's list, nnd a number more complaining. Not
knowing to what extent the sickness might go, and not having more
than one month's provisions on board, a t eight P. M. I was under the
necessity of coming to a determination to give up the blockade of
Tripoli, and proceed to Gibraltar.
"Mr. Gavino informed me about a month ago, that the Tripolitcm
admiral had laid up his two corsairs hare, and took his passage, with
eight of his officers, on b o d of an English ship bound to Malta,
leaving tbe captain of the brig and twenty men, to take care of the
two vessels, and bring the ship home, if he had an opportunity; sent
the remainder of his men over to Tetuan in boats.
"I think i t necessary that two frigates should remain in those seas
all the winter, under the present circumstances. Tho Philadelphia to
rendezvous a t Saragossa, the south east end of the island of Sicily.
I shall give captain Barron orders to show himself off Tripoli and
Tunis every now and then, to lot those fellows know and see that we
are on the watch for them. The Essex to rendezvous a t Gibraltar
and Algeziras, as may be most convenient, to keep a good look out,

has taken even his ring from his finger from him thus has the object
of his mission been impeded for the present, but the Tripoline Jews
have made him considerable advances, & he proceeds in the same Vessel
for Tangiers in a few days, I have reason to suspect that he has orders
to touch a t Algiers in order to influence the Dey of Algiers to espouse
his master's cause, consequently to our prejudice I therefore submit
to your consideration the utility & propriety of intercepting this
Ambassador, & det.nining him, & his property & Suit, as he 1s our
active enemy in every sense of the Word Tbe Preliminary articles of Poace were sign'd a t London between
France & Great Britain on the first instant, & we were informed of i t

three of them, Every Encurngement is given to the Privatiersmen to
bring into this place Every American Vessel they can capture that is
Bound up the Mediterranean, to see if they can find out if they were
going to touch at Gibmltar, when a Vessel is brought in here, there is
no possibility of her geting nway again, under one month; when the
Governours Privatiers brings in my Vessels, he is the Chief Judge of
the Cause; If there is not a stop put to such nefarious conduct ns is
carried on here at present, towards the Americans there is no knowing
where it will end, particularly as the Owners of the Privatiers and
Privatiersmen, have to pay no damages let them be ever so .mo

suffer the Cap+ to write a Letter to me, to I~Iformme that he was
Brought in Here - I cannot help observing to you Sir that I think
such conduct is a Direct Insult to the United States, and ought to be

Strongest manner that Z can to the Goverment of the nited States The P h W p h i a and &sex is not arrived here, as yet. I have

If the King of Spain thinks he dos England or the Inhabitance of
Gibraltar any Inju b the supposed Blockade he is very much mistdcen, ti. his frienz t i e Americans that is Injured the most by it,

the S t r r b , and Straits Mouth, and as far as Mdaga, when you may
think it necessay. - (untill relesved by some Ship of the next Squadron that is mrmng out) always taking very good care not to be too
long away from Gibraltar, so as to let the two Tripoline Corsairs get
out. You will please to have frequent Communication with Mr
Gavino to know what situation they are in; Algeziras is a much better road thsn Gibraltar to lay in In the Winter Season I dont think
i t will be necessary for you to be much a t Sea; I cannot think there
will be any Danger from TripoIino Corsairs in the Winter Season.
Should you find i t to the contrary you will give every protection in
your power to the Merchant Vessels of the United States that may
come within your notice, also the Sweodish Merchtmen, as the Sweedish Ships of War w i l l do the same towards our Merchant Vessels, but
in no case whatever are you to quit your Station for any length of
time, without you are very sertsin that the two Tripdine, Conairs,
which is now laying a t Gibraltar, with their yards and Topmasta
down, is in such a sutuation that they cannot go to Sea, under a
much longer time than you would be of' your Station - Should you
stand in need of mony for the use of your ship, you will see by the
copy of my Instructions from the Navy Department, which you have
got, the sum and whose Hands the credit is lodged in for the use of
the Squadron. I enclose you a copy of Mr Turners Letter to me on
the Business for your guide, as you cannot obtain money for Bills on
London under 20 or 25 Pr C? loss you w i l l try to make as little as
possible mrve ou - I also Inclose you a copy of a Lctter that I
have received rom Mr King our Minister in London, Informing you
that the King of England, had given Orders to his Minister, to give
orders, to the OEcers of his Garrisons in the Mediterranian, to supply tho Squadron which I have the Honor to command with any
stores that they ma want, out of his Magazins; Should you stand m
need of any kind o stores (that you cannot do without) for the use
of your ship you will apply according1 . After you are releaved you
will make the best of your way to d w York, without ou receive
Orders to the contrary. I have wrote the Secretary o tho Navy
that you are to remaui untill relieved I suppose he will lose no time
in sending a ship for that purpose
After I take my departure
from those Seas (which will be as soon as I go to Algiers and sittle
some Business with Mc OBrien & return back here) you d
lconsider
your sdf under tile Command of Samuel B a m n Esqr - Afterwards
should he deem it necessary to order you of[fl your station, you are
to obay his Orders notwithstanding what I have said in these Orders
should any thing turn up, which it is Impossible for me to see at present, and of such a nature as to make it necessary in your Judgment,
to deviate from any part of tllose Orders, you have my consent so to do

Cibrnlfar Bay Octr 9tP 1801
SIR,On the 4* Ins5 which was the day that I wrote you by the
Enterprize a Very Disagreeable circumstance in its event, took place,
the Particulars, is as follows Viz,
On the 1V Ins+Charles Davis (Seaman) Deserted from the ship by
swiming on shore the 2Ydhe was, apprehended by Mr Cox, Midship
man, and Brought on Board again he was put in Irons below, and a
eentinal put over him The mght following he Bribed the sentinel,
and deserted again by swiming on shore; the 4'" Mr John Trippe and
Edward N. Cox, Midshipmen, being on shore on Liberty, apprehended him again; while Mr Cox went to geat a guard, to put him under
confinement (as the said Deserter would not go with them) he made
use of a Very abusive Language to Mr Trippe and attempted to make
his escape from him, as I am Informed, Ms Trippe wounded him in
two places with his Durk, he was then ut under guard until1 he
should be sent for; the said Deserter to1 the Officer of the Guard
that he was an Englishman and claimed the protection of a, British
subject that he was no Americm; a Surgoon was sont for by the
Officer to examine his wounds, the result was that the wound on the
Brest was Dangerous. - A Boat and an Officer of the ship was sent
for the said Deserter, the Officer of the Guard gave him up When he
was Brought on Board, I requested the Doctt to Examine his wound,^
and report to me his opinion respecting them, he informed me they
were slight and no ways dangerous; I sent for Mr Trippe and gave
him a severe reprimand for his conduct, and Empressed on his mind;
the disagreeable consiquences that would have resulted, had he have
killed the man on shore or if the man should still die with his u-ounds.This circumstance made much nois and discontent on shore, among
the Inhnbitance, the Officer of the Guard wss blamed Very much for
givin the man up on the 6" at 11. A. M. a Master and Commander,
the ommanding Naval Officer at Gibraltar a t the time came on
Board to demand the said Charles Davis as being a British eubject,
and the Chief Judge demanded, that both the officer and the man,
should be sent on shore and given up to the Cival Authority I told
the Officer that I knew of no British subject being on Board the U S.
Ship President, that the said Charles Davis, shiped himself with his
own free will, as an American Citizen, and that I should keep him on
board as such, untill I arrived in America if he lived so Iong; as to my
giving Both him and the Officer up to the Civil authority, for the
Officers transaction on shore, It required some conaideration I told
him I would meet him in one Hours time a t the Chief Justises; he
took his leave and went on shore. - I took the Doctr with me and
w&ed on the Judge and Informed him that from the report made to
me, by my Doctor (as he was present he rnigbt ask him any questions
he thought proper, on the subject) the wounds that the man received
from the Officer was no ways Dangerous, and as the man received
them, when he was a deserter from tho U. S. Ship Presided at the
time, trying to make hie Escape from the OBFrcer, I told him under
such circumstances, I could not think of giving them up. I told him

f

WARS WITfl BARBARY POWERS
he might send a Surgeon on Board to Examine the mans wounds for
the truth of what my DoctF said. - A little altercation took place
between us, a t last he said he would get a Sur&eon to go on board to
Examine the wounds and would act accordmg to the report the
Surgeon made him I t001i my leave of him and came on Board, At
4 P. &I. the Surgeon came on Board to examine the wounds, after he
Examined them he told me the wounds was of no consequence - I
Hoard nothing more of the Busincm while I lay at Gibraltar, but was
treated with great attention On the 20"' the said Charles Davis,
Died. - the inclosed is the doct=report respecting l i s death, I n con&
quence of whidl I have Ordered M: Trippe under confinement that
ho may be trycd by a Court Martial, when an oppertunity offers On the 9* Inst a t 4 P. M. I got under way from Gibraltar and a t
7 d9 came to Anchor in the Bay of Ngeziras found laying here our
store ship from New York captured in the Straits by n Spanish Gunbont privntier and brought in there on the 5* Inst The Captain waa
not perinitted to write or to send a message on shore, I wrote to the
Governor, the Impropriety of detaining a Vessol of the her discription,
on the l6* she was put in my possession 1 lost no time in taking out
what stores that was necessary for the use of the President, and procured stores to put the remainder in to prevent the ship from laying
a t such heavy damage - the other two ships not being there. - 1
saw by the Charter party, the ship was chartered for the sole use of
the U S. I gnve my word and honor to the Governor that the ship
had nothing In but stores for tho use of Squadron, that I had the Honor
to command, I was much mortified afterwards to find that she had
in 150 Bbl" Flower, and 20 Tierces of rice belonging to some Merchants in New York, Such transactions might have a tendency to
bring both me and my Country into disgrace in the Eyes of the people
of this Country particularly in the present Situation of things, - by
puting the above articles in; the ship was brought so much by the
sterne, that she would not sail; the Caps Informed me if the ship had
been in proper trim he was very certain, he would have been here 10
or 12 days sooner. - You will see by the enclosod certificate the
number of drays that she was in my possession and the articles that is
missin. - I t is a painful task for me to Inform you of the sad catastro he, that happened to the cutter (a boat belonging the President)
an the Officers and men that was in her, on the 22* Ins! i t being a
very h e morning I sent her over to Gibraltar with a Letter to Mr
Gavino, requesting him to have the Articles that had been ordered
for the ship, in readyness, as E Expected to be over with the ship in
two or three Days allso to know the news of Gibraltar. - The Boat
left Gibraltar to return back, a t 11. OClock, A. M. by this time the
wind was Blowing ve fresh; by some niss conduct the Boat
oversett and every sole ost but one man, which I have not seen as
yet When I do I shall be able to give you a more particular A C Cthe

enclosed is a list of the Officers and men that mas lost in the Boat, i t is
something surprisin~that the boat was not seen to oversett either
from Algeziras or Gibraltar, as it is not nioro than 5% Miles a Cross,
and tho Accident took place between 2 % 3 oClock. - On this da
I left Algezeras and proceeded for the Bey of Gibraltar a t 9 A.

by the Spanis Gunboats, the wind being to the Eastward, and as I
&d not wish them to loose a good oppertunity of geting through, I
told him, to go and toll the Capto to get underway that I would see

MAYIT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCY,
From your friendly Expressions
towards my Nation, in our last corraspondence, I was willing to hope
that I should not halve had the palnfull task, of addressing your
Excellency again, on so disagreeable a subject ns I conceive the present
to be. - On the 19* Ins; m the Broad da , an Amencan Merchant
Vessel (a Ship) the wind blowing strong rom the Westy* she wss
beating to windward, in standing close in shore to shelter them selves
from the Violence of the Sea, and wind she ap roached one of our
forts a little to the Eastward of the Rock with er colours f l p g a t
the time, the Fort commenced fireirlg a t her, and fired ten shot without
ceasing, the 29d shot killed a man while he was pre aring to get the
Boat out, to go on shore to the Fort, the Vessel was aying too $1 the

killed, I saw the transaction my self from Algeziw, and your Excelency might have seen it from your owne door - I did not say any
thing a t the tlme, becaus I was I n hopes there was no person hurt - I
cannot help observing to your Excellent that I conceive such conducf
more resembles the Savages than a c i d z e d nation
On the 27'P Inst I was beating to windward in this Bay in company
with a Frigate belonging to the Squadron which I have the Honor to
command, and an American, Brigg all with our wlours flying, the
Brig stood within Gun shot, not knowing that they had done rong,
s s they had seen us do i t ; the fort commenced fweing a t her the &st
shot went Just over her, the 29d carried away part of her rudder the
third went within two or three yd? of her, before they could fire again,
the Brig got under my Lee what am I to judge from such conduct,
but that the Officers commanding a t these Forts are perfect Savages
and wish to kill Innocent men for mear sport sake (as I could see a
great number of men about the Batterys at the time) or that they have
orders to act as they do, as f conceive the last transaction, to be a
direct Insult to the Flag of my nation, which I have the honor to command under, a t present, I shall represent i t as such tq His Most
Catholick Ma esty, and my Government, and should a sirmlor circumstance take p ace while I have the Honor to represent my nation in
those Seas I shall return the fire, let the consiquence be what i t may. the whole subject of my complaint your Excellency might have seen
from your own house. -

had not captured any Americans Vessels a t that time, I do not think
they will go to sea this winter - the Adniiral got to Tripoli three days
before the two Ships nrrived of[fl there, he landed Forty Miles to tho
Eastward of Tripoli in a Vessel from Malta he is a man, of no Enterprize, little danger, I think, is to be apprehended from him, he will
think that Cap' Barron is determined to catch him at any ratc, be
must know the ship well by this time, that is the out side of her, I wish
Cap$ Barron had been so fortunate as to have made him acquainted
with the Inside - Sir respecting my acting in concert with the Sweedish Commanders, in annoying the Marine of Tripoli, and mutually
protecting the commerce of the two Nations agalnst its piracy you
could not act wrong in suggesting the mutual ndvantzge, it would be,
to both Nations, i t meet!s with my sincere approbation, and nothing

not had the pleasure as yet of seeing the Sweedish Commander Should
I see 1Lim before I quit those seas, I shall settle a plan of Co-operation
with him, in such a way, that there will be little danger of the Merchant Vessels of either Nation being taken by the Tripoline Corsairs;
Cap? Barron will sail as soon, as he can get his ship ready (which will
be in two or three days) up the Mediterranean, to give convo to all

there I shrtll proceed for the United States touching a t this place on my
way, which I suppose will be about the Latter end of Novr.Should
you wish to write to the U. S. you will please to send your litters to
Mr Gavino - I t is very pleasing to mc, that you should think, that
the Squadron under my command has been so arranged, and conducted, as to have baffled the Intentions, of thc Bey of Tripoli and his
Admiral, I t has been my pride, from the first of my arrival in those
Seas, as well as the Commanders that I have had the Honor to Command, to Empress on the minds of those people, also, the European
Nations, what the Government of the United States can do - and
will do, I hope, when drove to act in a hostile manner - If the Government of the United States will send the force that I have requested
(which is but small) I would be answerable for Tripolis bcing taken
In two da s after the force anived off There - There never was, nor
will there e again, for some time to come so favourable an oppertunity
for the U. S. to Establish a lasting reputation, for its flag in those seas I have not had the pleasure, as yet, of seeing the, Gentleman that you
makc mention of in your letter, when I do you may be assured that I
shall pay him every attention in my power, - the enclosed is a copy
of a Letter that I have sent to the Spanish Commander in Chief a t Ss
Roque - You may do as you think best with it, I cannot suppose
that the King of Spain knows of the disrespect that is paid to our flag
by a number of his OfIicers, If he dos know it & dos not put a stop to it,
we may expect in a Very short time Ve serious consiquences, between
the parties for my part, I shall act as have told the Commander in
Chief in my letter to him, I can never submit to see the flag of my
Country Insulted in that way without resenting it, while I have the

for Algiers after I saw the conro through the Straits but the wind
blowing fresh from the Eastward was under the necessity of Anchoring in the Bay of Gibraltar again; - the 27F UltQthe P h W p h b
arrived from Tunis, nothing new respecting the Tripolines - Doct?
Turner of the Philadelphia, being Very Ill, Cap? Barron put him on
shore at Tunis, to stay with Mr Eaton Expecting it would be of service
to him, but on his return from Tripoli, he found him still so 1ll as
not to be able to go on Board. - the Philadelphia proceeded to Algeziras to tnke her Provisions on Board On the l* Inst a t 8, am. I
made the Signal to the Philadelphia & Essex to know if they were
ready to get under way; they answered ;In two Hours - they would, I got underwa and sent orders to a11 the Merchant Vessels, a t Gibraltar to get unc ferway, the wind still from the Eastward but 1' ht, a t

gave orders to Cap?Bainbridge to see the Merchant Vessels to Malaga,

all possible dispatch that the Merchant Vessels might not be detained
longer than was necessary, water was not to be got a t Algeziras - on

a short time, I thought it best to convene a Court Martial, to Try
Mr Trippe and a Serjeant of Marines, as i t is Very disagreeable,. to
keep men so long under confiniment without bringing them to a tnal,
the result of which I intend to send you herewith rf ready. - To
Morrow evening I shall proceed for Algiers, and from thence to Port
Mahon to know the particulars respecting the Inclosed extract, of a
letter from the Sweedish Consul, a t Alictmt, to Mr Kirkpatrick of this
place, Mr Kirkpatrick Informs me, that a man told him, that the
three Vessels Bought by the Bey of Tripoli's Agent, a t Mahon, was
bou ht to be delivered in Tripoli by the persons that sold them, I
am formed, that one of them mounts 36 Guns, a cruiser taken from
the Spanards by the English, - I am more fearful of his getting
a number or renegados of all Nations into his Service than I am of his
Vessels; Should that be the case, he will be able to keep some of his
corsairs a t Sea in the winter Season, in that case I am fearful that they
will capture some of our merchant Vessels, as i t is Impossible to keep a
number of Merchant ships togeather, in bad weather and long
nights. - I am confident you will see the necessity of sending a
strong force into those seas to protect our commerce, if i t is Intended
by Government, to continue the war with Tripoli, the Bey of Tripoli
is making use of every exertion to get the Dey of Algiers, the Bey of
Tunis and the Emperior of Morocco to join him, and make it a common caus, against the United States, from what I can find out, the
Be of Tunis is willing to do it, how far he will succeed I cannot say,
I s all know more about it when I get to Algiers Peace has not as yet, been proclaimed in Spain but it is daily Expected to take place. -

ESTEEMED
SIR I had the pleasure of receiving on the 39 Instant
yours of the 16th Ult? I am glad to find you are well; ou will have
heard from M' Montgomery that the United States hip the Geo:
Washington Captain Shnw arrived a t Algeirs on the 5* of October
and with snid ship the Peace and Plenty with the last of the stipulation
for Tunis. That the [George] Washington is nearly discharged and
will sail in about 15 or 20 days from this for Tunis and takes under
her convoy the Peme and Plenty.
The arrival of the [George] Wmhingtm has much contributed with
the Knowledge of the 3 Frigates being in this Sea to serve our affaira
and there was no alternative but for said Ship to enter this Port. I t
gives us here security for the present. As I had refused this Regency
the passports &c for the Crews of the two Tripolians from Oran I
did not like to ask the Dey for one for the Ship for Tunis;further
after his not enforcing the guarantee of the Treaty with Tripoly I
thought we had not better trust to H
i passport and further I would
wish to have him and his Ministry both Turkish nnd Jewish know
that we finally would make force to be our passport.
This might not be economy; but Sir it is a t present requisite policy.
I had my fears that the two Tripolian Cruizers a t Gibraltar finding
that we had no Frigate to blockade them and that this Sea was quite
free for them, that as the Gibraltar craft and boats were so frequently
passing from Gibraltar to Oran and returning, that these 30 or 40
men that remained a t Gibraltar in the two Cruizers of Tripoly would
know that the Coast was clear, and that these a t Gibraltar would
Know that these Crews to the number of 250 were a t Oran that the
two Cruizers would push for Ornn and take on board these men and
obtain supplies and be an Enemy in the rear of our two Eastern
Frigates and the President in want of provisions and having a Sickly
Crew could not act, my fears were great on this occnsion. I therefore
intimated to the proper persons here that I daily expected four more
of our Frigates in this Sea, that they would proceed of3 Tunis and
coastways they might get adjacent to Tripoly. This finesse had the
desired effect and they sald 250 were shipped off from Oran on board
of a Ragusean Vessel and sailed from Oran about the 12" of October.
The Essez and Philadelphia were a t Tunis the 25* of Se tember and
fall in with
proceeded for the Coast of T r i p l y where I hope they
the Ragusee with the 25 Tripolians a t all events i t will leave the two
Cruizers at Gibraltar in a sure situation that they can do us no h-,
that if they intend for See to Cruise they must push for Triply or
else Bashaw send them Crews. -

The &and Turk was a t Tunis the 25* of September and afraid to
proceed on account of the Tripoly Cruizers. The Algerine General
of Marine the Dey's Ambassador to the Grand Seiior returned here
the 12th Ulto. This Government has purchased the influence and
friendship of the Captain Bashaw, they have arranged their whole
afairs, got their money and to this date there has arrived 750 Turk
recruits - The Grand Sefior gives to Algiers as presents 4000 recruits
40 Braw Guns 500 Barrels of powder 1000 Quintals of Sulphure 40000
Balls 500 Bales sail Cloth 100 Masts 6000 plank and 1000 Quintals
Ropeyarns, Pitch, Tar and Rosin 1000 Barrels besides Caftans and
valuable presents to the Dey and Ministry. part of those articles we
nrrived here. This I suppose is Turkish Policy to strengthen the
hands of this State, the principal political Redoubt of the Ottoman
Empire - or to lull this Regency into security to plunder them - we
shall see what the French and British will do to alter the System of
Barbary.
Thoy might as usual still see their policy in letting it exist. This
place has been for 19 days occupied fitting out 6 of their large Corsairs
they sailed on the 5+ Instant and before this time are on the Coast
of Spain.
This circumstance and some bad Weather have prevented the discharge of the [George] Washingion If Commodore Dale does not arrive here within a few days we shall
have no prospect of making a cash payment for one years Annuity
in lieu of Stores. But peacable times will give us Articles much
Cheaper on the Annuities. The Ship to Tunis will make 21 Thousnnd

My intentions in coming to this

need of, but more particularly to be fully satisfied respecting the
infermation that I have received of there Having been three Armed
Vessels (Intended as Corsairs) purchaisid in this port b the Bey of

that those Vessels is to be, or has been completly fitted and are to be
maned by Minorcans, and is to sail, or has sailed under English
Colours, and is to claim the protection of that Flag, untill they arrive
a t Tripoli, this is done I am told to deceive the ships of war belonging
to tho United States, should they fall in with any of those that is
cruising in those seas to protect its commerce, and against the Bey of
Tripoli who has wantonly & unjustly Declared war against the
Umted Stabs. Should the above iufirmation be true I am confident that your
excellency will see, that such transactions, is a Violation in a high
degree of the 21" & 24 Articles of the subsisting Treaty, between the
two Nations - I am Very confident (from His Britanic Majesty's,
marked attention to the Squadron which I have the Honor to command in those Seas; in his giving orders to all Commanders of his
Ships of War, and ports in those seas, for the Hospitable reception of
the ships under my command, in the ports of Gibraltar, Minorca, and
Malta, and to be Supplied from his Majestys Magazines, with what
theire necessities may rcquire) that it is his wish that the present good
understanding between tho two Nations should not be disturbed in
that way. - the friendly attentiou that I Iiave mett with a t Gibraltar & Malta the Disposition of the parties has dways been such as
to wish for a perpetual friendship between the two Nations, of which
I am fully persuaded was truly sincere - I am very willing to beleave that your Excellency would not suffer any transaction within the
limits of your Goverment, knowingly to be done, that would tend in
the smallest degree to desturbe that good understanding which subsists between the two Nations a t present. But should any Vessel or Vessels such as I have described have
gone to Sea, or intend going, and should any shi s of the Squadron,
which I have the Honor to Command fall in wit m y of them as I
have given orders accordingIy, I hope the Commanders, and my self,
will be excused for not paying that attention to the British Flag, in

blowing a strong Gale from the Westward, which increased to a

Two of our Cables had been so much worn, as to render them

am in perfect habits of friendship with the Governor of Portofarine
who is to receive it; and as Captain Woods desires to profit of the

any such transaction oing on that I might rest assured that he would
put s stop to it, he d o informed ma from the inquiry that had been
made since he received my letter, that there was a large Xebeck
mounting 34 Guns 12 & 9 pounders, said to be purchased for the Bey
of Tunis that the Governor was determined that she should not leave
the port untill good surity was given that she was not for the Bey of

I received I should have been Very disagreeably situated here had it not been
for the polite sttention, of Henry Patu Merchant in this place, He

under perfect command of the Helm, Just within the enterance of
the Harbour the Pilot run the ship on a rock going a t the time 5 or 6
Knots, which stoped her way almost Instantly, she fell of[fj from the
rock and soon geathered way, and in the course of a few minutes was
out of the port, The shock was so great as almost, to Heave me of[fl
my feet in the cabin (I had been confined to my cot for several days,
but not feeling easy in my mind, knowing the passage to be very
narrow in going out I got up and put on my cloths) I thought in the
first lnstmoe that the Bows was stove in and that the ship was
sinking, which was the Opinion of Cap$ Barron, and the officers (on
the Quarter Deck) when I got there - I cannot describe to you my
feelings a t the timo, but you may readily suppose they were very
disagreeable, my apprehentions was (in some memure) soon agreeably
releaved by being informed that the Ship made no water - I called a
Counsul of the principal Wicers, to know there opinion relative to
the damage that might be occasioned by such a severe stroke, Bt
weither it would be most prudent to keep the sea or return to port
(the result was as it did not appear a t present that the ship made any
more water than usual) to keep the sea. Notwithstanding, I am very confident that some part of the fore
Bod of the shi (low down) is considerably injured from the severe
stm e it reoeiv2 against the mok. - At 8 P. M. it came on to Blow
a very Heavy Gale of wind from the Westward, and continuedthree
days so violent that we could not carry more s[a]il than the Fore Sail
and Storm Staysails, the second and third day the sea got so very
High, and short, as to occasion the ship to labour Very much, and
make more water than usual but I a t t n b u t d it to the upper works
being open Several of the Half ports being forced in by the Sea - A
quantity of wahr geting on the Gun,deck, in course some part of it
got on the Birth Deck, and the Air port in the betwen Decks, leaking
very much, the 3'q Day at 6 p. m. one of the men came on the Quarter
Deck and Informed Cap1 Barron that the water was above the cole, in
the Coal Hole, the pump well was sounded, found there was between
3 & 4 feet water in the Hold the pumps was set to work, Mr Wood
2'q Lieu;, the Master & the Gunner (the Carpenter is good for nothing,
in course not to be depended on) was ordered to examine the state of
the Coal Hole, they returned and confirmed the report of the man, the
Gunner said he could hear the water run in Mr Chaunsey the first
Lieut, said he could not hear tbe water run in, but the water was there,
It occasioned a Very general alarm for some time as the Coal Hole is in
that part of the ship that struck against the rock in a little time the
was freed by the pumps, and did not make more water than a good
in two Hours after, and I suppose would not make much more
an usual, in moderate weather - Notwithstanding it was my
opinion, also Ca Barrons that it was most prudent to bear up, and
proceed for To on, there examine her Bottom as well as we wuld to
see if it was absolutely necessary to heave her down, or put her in
dock, before we proceed for the United Statas being confident should
we d v e safe there, that it would be absolute1 necessary to look at
Her Bottom before she went to sea again only that going on

circumstances i t would have been very probable, to have been very
disagreeably situated before we arrived in America, a t that season of
the year - and should we have been so unfortunate as never to have
been heard of more, the accident would be attributed soly to the ships
runing against the rock. - My mind had enough to contend with
before, without the addition, of the disagreeable apprehentions in
every gale of wind, of the sad consiquonces, that mi ht possibly take
place from the said accident, when I sailed from d & o n , it was my
Intentions to proceed for Gibraltar from thence to the United States,
but not without knowing the Intention, of the Algerine Corsairs
being out, - I expected to have fell in with some of them on my way
to Gibraltar.
On the 6* Inst 1 arrived in this Port, I can not say much in favour
(as yet) of the attention of the People of the Grent Nation, in this
place, towards the Flag of the U. S. When corning in I fired m r a l
Guns and made the Sign! for a Pilot, no Boat came near the
ship until1 I was a t Anchor two Hours, or better, then Admiral
Ganthom [Gantheaume] sent his boat, and proffered his services m d
Informed me, that I must send my Boat on shore, to the Prattique
House, the Boat was, sent - She returned shortly after with the
p M n g infernbation of the ship being put in Quarantine for 15 Days
and two men sent on Board as a y a r d to see there was no Improper
conduct while in Quarantine, I sent them on shore again, they were
sent back, Informing me that if they were not permitted to remain
on Board, I could not have any supplys from the shore Had the
ship not been in the situation she is in a t present I would not have
remained one moment longer in port, those people can not think, that
I have any Honor, or respect for the character of my Count#5 "he?
they suppose, by sending a guard on Board, that I would su er t h m
Quarantine laws to be Violated - I suppose the fact is, they think
no nation have any Honor but them Selves. - The Commadnnt of

that he would be Happy to render me every assistance in hi power,
that i t is his orders from his Goverment to be friendly towards the

usurper, had addressed the Dey of Algiers and begged his mediation
to bring about a reconciliation with the American government; and
expressed great solicitude to know whether, in my opinion, the
Americans would admit such an intervention? I did not hessitate to
give i t as my opinion that my Government, haring once been deceived
by that Dey, would now seek to establish their peace on a surer brase.
Ho then desired to be advised whethcr he might place m y reliance on
the operations of the Americms in his behalf - I recommended to
him patience and silence; at the same time gave him leave to entertain the hope (may it not be illusive) that thc next summers Operations would favor his views With my letter of 19. Oct. wont a copy of one from the Swedish
C h q O des affair= here, stating a resolve of the Court of StockLtolm
"To act in co-operafim and make common cause with the United

United States had resolved to act in co-operation and make common
came with Swede11 against Tripoli. Does not their common eawe
and co-operation with the Dancs in the late Northern Coalition afford
a useful caution to tho United States against such an alliance? Besides, what American can cheerfully admit the idea that the United
States will t h i i proper to divide with any nation whatever the honor
and the advantages of chastising Tripoli: The object itsclf does not
seem to rcquire such a parade.

sailed for this country, prior to the arrival of this letter, or should
either of the other vessels besides the Boston have sailed, then the
Boston only must come, so that there shall be two vessels left in the
Mediterranean.
If you determine that the two to be left shall be the P h i W hia &

such instructions as you may ave rewived from this depf, & communicate to him all the in!ormation you may possess, that may in
any degree be of service m the prosecution of the object of the
squadron.
You will perceive that these orders are predicated upon the suposition, that Algiers and Tunis still remain peaceful, and that there
%as not been any formidable preparations made by Tripoli for prosecuting the warfare. The vessels returning home must deposit all the provisi?ns, they
may have on board, be ond what will be necessary to b m g them
home, with John Gavino sq., for the use of the public ships rem
The ship Boston must be sent to Boston, the other, return agreeab y

that Ship received by the severe stroke - Yesterday being the first

SIRWhen I wrote you by LtSterett on the 5 @November Imt, I
expectedit would have been the last time that I should have addressed
you from the Mediterranean, Commodore Dale having then determined to Sail for America on the first of December, but unexpectedly
c d e d to Algiers & upon our arrival a t that place being inform'd that
the Tripolitans had purchased s e v e r ~Vessels
l
a t the Port of Mahon
in the Island of Minorca & were fitting them to Cruize against the
vessels of the Uni'ted States we proceeded Immediately to that Port,
for the Purpose of making Enquiry respecting this Armament, as
well as to retrieve the Health of our men. Having accomplished those
ends, we left that Port on the first Inst. for America where we expected
to arrive by the first of Jenuary, but how soon was our expectation
Expeld, upon coming out of the Harbour, the Mouth of which is
Narrow & Rocky, the Ship Stsuck & Supposing her Bottom much
Injur'd & there being no place iq Mlnorca for repairing Vessels,
Commodore Dale thought most advisable to proceed on to this place,
where we arrived on the 6Q& ShaIl without dela make the Necessary
R e p a h . To do this I expect i t will take us unt& the 6rst of February
Next A few days Subsequent to my Letter by Lt Sterett the Frigate
Philadelphia arrived in the Bay of Gibraltar when I was informd by
Commodore Dale that Cap! Samuel Barron wished a Court Martial
for the trial of Sergt Rogers of the Marines, belonging to L?Fenwicks
Detachment, charged, with Striking one of the Masters Mates on
board the Philadelphia. Accordingly a Court was Summoned to be
holden on board the Vessel on the 7d of November which Consisted
of the Following Officers Viz Capts Samuel & James Barron Capt Bainbridge, Lts.Chauncey, Decatur,. Fenyvlck, Hopper, & myself, I stated
to the Court, that in my opimqn, ~t was k b l y Improper for the
OEeers to ait on the trial of M a m y , when Marine Officers suflicient
were present to form tb Board, t b caused for Some time a warm
discussion between Captain Saumel Barroq and myself, be oveniled
we promded to Trial when i t was determined that Rogers hould be
reduced to the Ranks & receive fift h h e s , which sentence was
executed - As you will be better ab e to Judge of the Propriety of

this Sentence when you See the Proceedings of the Court, which will
be forwarded on to the Office of the Secretary of the Navy, as well as
a Copy which I shall take for your satisfaction, I shall refrain from
Saying anything on the Subject a t Present. - Capt Sam1 Barron
having determined to discharge Rogers I thought i t best to take him
on board the President & not suffer him to be discharged in a Foreign
Country, Since he has been under my Command he has behaved
himself extremely well - During the Cleaning of the Ship I sha.11 take
the Marines on Shore their clothes look well. I have purchased for

GENTLEMEN,
I have the Honor to acknowledge the relcfiep! of your
favour of the 25" Inst I note its contents Your conjectures respecting Messre E. DeButts and W. Y. Purvinnce of Leghorn being Agents for the United States is right in some
measure - Those Gentlemen have received orders to supply the
Squadron under my command, with whatever it may stand in need
of, should it touch a t Leghorn, also to accept any Bills that T may
draw on them, they received orders from the Government of the
United States, also from my self, to lodge letters of credit in favor of
the Commanding, Officer of the Squadron in thc different ports of
Italy, France and Spain, that they might not be a t a loss, should the
Squadron or any of the Ships belonging to it put into any of the Said
ports and want Supplys - Those Gentlemen are authorbed to
draw on Mess? Mackmzie & Glennie, of London, to reimburse them
selves for any money that they may advance for the uso of the Said
Squadron So far those Gentlemen are Agents, but i t always rests with
me, to draw either on them or on the Gentlemen in London. - as I
may think best for the intereat of the U. S. I n the present Instance
(as MessN J. M & Glennie has lodged a credit in the Hands of Mr
Cathalan) I think it best to draw on them - notwithstanding M;
Cathalans Having the said letter had he not been consul for the
U. S. I should not have hesitated in letting the Business go thro h
your hands I shall always consider i t my duty wbile I am in t e
Publick Service, and in a foreign Country to give as much credit as
possible to the man that my Government has honored with its confidence as Consd, without I am informed from good authority that
he is not deserving of it, and that the Goverment has been deceived
in the man - If h 0 Cathalan is a man of that description i t has
not come to my knowledge as yet. You must know when a man is appointed to an Office a fore
Country, the moro respect and confidince placed in ~UII, by t e
Government, that appolnts him, and its officers the moro influence,
and respect he will Commnnd in the Country that he resides m those motives has been the solo caus, in this instance, of lettlng the
Business go throu h the Hands of Mr Cnthalan particularly when I
conceive the emo umenta arising from the transaction cannot be
p e a t and as far, as i t respects the, Interest of the U S. the same, as
if i t had not. - I should be very sorry that any act of mine, should
give pain or ,uneasiness to any person, and more particularly to you,
