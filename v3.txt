NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1803 TO 1804
Hearing a t the Rock that two Tripolitans were off Cape de
Gatt made me proceed with all Expedition to Examine that part
very fresh a t 8 P. M.
of the Spanish Coast. On the 26t4blo*
being nearly up with Cape de Gatt fell in mth a ship c
y only
her foresail & had a Brig in Compan under the same sa' , it being
night di her Guns housed prevente8 sll imediate discovering her
to be a Cruiser, after hailing for some time found that she was a
Vessel of Wmr from Barbary, on which information I caused her
Boat to be sent on board the frigate Philad* with her Pass ports from wo@ I discoverd that she was a Cruiser belonging to the
Empr of Morocco CaUd Mesboh [Mirboka] Commanded by
Ibrahim Lubarez Mounting 22 Guns & Mand with 100 Men,
by not making ourselves known to the officer who came on board
he Confessd that the Brig [Celk] in Company was an American
& had been with them 3 or 4 days, was bound to some Port in
Spain, had been boarded by them, but not detaind, the low sail
in wPQ the Brig was under 'induced me to suspect that they bad
Captured her notwithstanding their having your Pmsport which
must appear from the sequel was only obtaind to protect them
against the American ships of Warr I sent my &st Lieu? on board to Examin if they had any
American Prisoners, on his attempting to Execute my orders, he
was prevented by the CapQ of the Cruiser, this increased my
suspition and I sent a Boat with a m d Men to inforce m
tions, after they were on board they found Capri Richar Bowen
In
of the American Brig Celia Ound by Mr Amasas Thlalyer of
Boston and several of his Crew, who was taken the 17's Inst
from Barcelona - bound to Malaga within 2 or 3 Leagues of the
Spanish shore, & about 25 Miles to the Eastward of Malaga,
the Caps & the Crew they had Confined below Deck which
they always did when speaking a Vessel, after Making this Discovery I instantly ordered all the Moorish Officers on board the
frigate, for I made no hesitation in Capturing her after such
proceedings on their part and Violation of the faith of Pass o r b
which ought to be Sacred - Oweing to the high Wind an Sea
it took me the greatest part of the Night to get the Prisoners
on board and Man the Prize which detention Occasiond loosing
sight of the Brig, the following Morning discovering many Vessels
in diver directions the Day was spent by the frigate & Prize in
chasing to find the Captured Brig about 4 P. M. made her coming
round Cape de Gatt from the Eastward, standing dose in shore
for Almeria Bay, owe& to the wind being very fresh we was
going slow in approaching her, all the greatest Exertions was
made by Lieu! Cox in Towing & Rowing the Prize, fortunately the
Wind increased in the Evening and we recapturd her a t 12
cClock at Night. - The Moors Confess that they came out
aCruising for the sole purpose of Capturing Americans to be sent
to Tanger. I have r e d a paper from them writen in Moorish

w F ~they

say is their authority from the Govr of Tanger for so
doing - I inclose this to John Gavino Esqr with a particular
request to have it safely Conveyd to you that you may be informed of the Circumstance and act accordingly. I beleive the
Govenour of Tanger is much disposed for Hostilities with the
U.S., the Moorish Prisoners accuse him as the sole cause of their
present Cituation. I sincerely hope that this Capture may be
productive of good Effects to the U. S. with the Emp' who may be
assured that if he injustly goes to Warr with the U. S. he will loose
every large Cruiser he has, & God grant that i t may not in the
least prove a disadvantage to you. My Officers and self have
made i t a Markd point to treat the Prisoners not only with the
lenity that is due from Humanity but with particular attention of
Civility to impress on their mind a favourable Opinion of the
American Character.
That you may receive this information as Early as possible I
dispatch my Boat on shore a t Malaga to request W. Kirkpatrick
Esqr Consul to forward it by Express to Gibr L shall be Extremely anxiouse to hear from you, as also for the arrival of
Comodor Prible to receive his Instructions relative to the Captured ship. I am bound to Gibraltar Bay with the Prize, but
am fearfull we shall be detaind for want of an Easterly wind.

FBIDAYSEPT: ~ N 1803.
D
- Anchored in Tunis bay a t 6 p. m. SATURDAY
3d, I went on shore, At 6 A. M. and dispatched a Courier to Tunis,
to inform the Bashaw of our arrival, and sent a Copy of inclosure NQ1, to Doctor
Davis. I came on board a t 8 A. M,. While on shore the Dutch Colonel of
Engineers, mentioned in my former communication, informed me, that Doctor
Davis had been a t the Gouletta, last Evening, when the frigate Anchored, and
had told him he had seen her flag, and that she was an American.
At. 2 pm.
Doctor Davis came on board and Dined with us: on our interrogating him respecting our situation with the Regency of Tunis, he answered, that perfect tranquility
existed a t this moment; that he had exerted himself considerably since he resided
a t Tunis; and that he was happy his efforts had been crowned with success. On
my expressing an impatience to land as soon as possible, as Captain Campbell's
instructions limited him to Four lay Days a t Tunis, he answered, the Bashaw
had not granted permission for our landing, and that He had come to know our
business, which he would explain to hi Excellency, as soon as possible, in order
that the desired permission might be granted. Captain Campbell presented him
with a Letter from Commodore Morris, informing him of my appointment and
suspending his functions; and I informed him of the motive of my errand. He
seemed considerably agitated, and went on shore a t 5 p m , . In the course of conversation, Captain Campbell declared, that he had no business t o transact on
shore, nor had He any desire t o see Tunis; and that He would consequently remain
on board, Doctor Davis said, the Bashaw would be displeaeed if the customary
visit was not paid him; that He was extremely psrticular in the etiquette of his
Court; that the Officers of all Ships of War paid his Excellency that compliment;
and that i t would be expectedfrom us; that as nodifficultgexisted, therewasnothing
to be apprehended; and that He would forfeit his Life and reputation, if any
impediment was placed in the way of his departure, when ever He pleased. I
joined in Doctor Davis's request, believing what He said; and Capt: Campbell
acquiesced, saying if B e could be of any service, He would go, though much
against His will. S U ~ A YSEPTEMBER
~ T E .Captain Campbell kept a boat on shore a t the
Goletta nearly all day: no n e m whatever was sent by Doctor Davis. We consequently were not informed of the cause which prevented our landing as customary;
this however, raised some unfavourable impressions, and Captain Campbell
determined that if an answer did not arrive next day by Meridian, to write to
Doctor Davis upon the subject, in terms expressive of his sense of the indignity
ogered us, and to get under way the moment his lay days expired. MONDAY
SEPTEMBER
~ T E .The Drogoman came on board with a Note from
Doctor Davis, about 10 A. M. expressing, that the Bey of Tunis offered no objection t o my landing with Captain Campbell and his suite: alledged, that want of a
Carriage was the cause of our detention, and that a Headache must plead an
excuse for his not receiving us a t the Gouletta. We landed and proceeded to Tunia, where we arrived a t 3 p. m, and found
Doctor Davis very well to all appearance. Permission was requested to visit the
Bashaw, and granted; and the audiance was appointed next Morning, a t 7 P. M.

~ T H . Waited upon the Bsshaw, in company with Captain Campbell,
Mr Davis, and two of the O5cers of the Adams; waa received very politely and
resented with Coffee. E delivered the Presidents Lettern to the Baehaw, with
fiteral translations in Italian: informed his Excellency, that I had some Verbal
communications to make, when He would please to hear me; He desired me to
make them to his Minister, when I pleased. Capt: Campbell having previously
determined t o go on board the next Morning, wished to take leave and asked if
his Excellency had any commands. The Bsshaw answered, None, only to wait
his answer to the Presidents Letters. Captain Campbell said the period for hb
remaining a t Tunis, expired next Day, and that He could not diviate from hi
instructions, I request you (replies the Bashaw), to wait Two Days longer, you
shall have my Answer on Thursday mornin precisely. In that case, (replied
Captain Campbell, to oblige your ExceUency) will wait the time you deaire. We
retired and waited on the Sahibtappa (ie) Prime Minister and seal bearer; was
received politely - common place conversation ensued. We drank Coffee and
retired, the minieter having appointed the next day, a t the Bame Hour for the
discussion of the points mentioned in the Presidents Letters to the Baahaw of
Tunie. -

WEDNESDAY
~ T H . Mr Davis did not arrive a t the Consular House from the
Country, untill 8 A. M. We waited upon the Minister a t 9. He asked what
language we should discourse in. I answered Italian, as I understood i t best.
Well then (says He), we will begin with the frigate. Have you perused the Presidents Letters? four or Five times, answered He. Then you are informed of
my instructions on that head, and consequently that point needs no further discusslon. What have you to offer that will be pleming to the Bashaw? A mark
of the Presidents esteem, which is calculated to perpetuate the good underatanding which so happily exists between our Nations, upon a basis permanent and unequivocal. The President viewing with some regret that other Nations enjoy
previledgea by Treaty with this Regency, which are fefmed to the Citizens of the
U. S, has ordered me to offer the Bsshaw of Tums, the sum of 24,000 Milled
Dollars payable every Three Years, to commence from the date of the agreement,
in order to induce him to make some slterations in our Treaty, of which, that of
most consequence, is to reduce the duties paid by Citizens of the U. S. to the
standard of other Nations (ie) 3 pr Cent. Advalorem; for you must be sensible,
that the unequality of duties militates equally against both parties, by your
exacting 10 pr Cent from Citizens of the US, while other Nations pay only Three,
You give them the advantage of underselling us, 7 Pr Cent; consequently you exclude our Vessels from your ports, and in lieu of encreasing your Revenue, you
prevent us from trading with you.
He paused a few moments, and said. He would inform the Bashaw of my proposals, and bring me his answer. I n half an Hour the Minister returned, and declared, that his Master (the
Bashaw) had ordered him to inform me, that He had not demanded an Annuity;
that He had demanded a Frigate, because He knew we had given one to another
of our Friends: that He did not want Cash: that Denmark. Sweeden and other
Nations gave him presents occasionally, of 'Maratime and &lilitary Stores; that
He treattd all His friends alike, and hoped the President of America would do the
same. And then, by way of interrogation, asked with a smile, pray what do you
pay a Year to Algiers? I leaded ignorance and the Minister continued, I likewise am ordered by my d m t e r to inform you, that, aa his policy is peace, He
cannot receive you as Consul resident, in this Regency, you having been the cause
of the War with Tripoli. He has wrote to the President of the United States on
the Subject, and will await his answer; during which time, He desires me to inform
you, that the American flag shall be treated with respect; and that He appoints Mr
George Davis to remain in the same situation, that Commodore Morris left him,
untill the will of the President is known. You may call for the Baahaw's Letters
in the Morning, a t 8 OIClock. -

The American Drogoman brough[t] a message from the Bashaw tu Capt: Campbell, informing Him, that He had determined not t o receive me as Consul of the
United States, for reasons which He would inform the President: that His Excellency had appointed Mr Davis to remain until answers came to the Bashaws
Letters, which He would be ready to deliver in the Morning. Mr Davis * * * said He would not wonder if Captain Campbell should
be detained untill Hadgi Unis ben Unis was satisfied for the claims made by the
Moors for prize goods sold a t Malta; and asked me whether I would assume the
debt or not. I informed Him, that I conceived this affair to depend entirely upon
the Commodore of the Station;

*

*

*

*

*

*

Ca t: Campbell informs me (for I was not in the office myself,) that Mr Davis
told f;im candidly, that He was apprehensive, that He would be detained untill
Hadgi Unis ben Unis was satisfied. Capt: Campbell answered, He may keep me
to all Eternity; but the Ship Sails to-morrow; and I will write home for government never to pay the debt; I will remain here for ever, before I suffer such indignity to be offered with impunity. * * *
THUR~DA
~T
YH . This Morning, daptain Campbell, Mr Davis and myself proceeded towards the Palace, in order to take leave of the Baahaw; while in the carriage, I asked Doctor Davis if He had settled with Hadgi Unis ben Unie. He said
He had not yet. Captain Cam bell then repeated nearly what He had said in the
,
He had already sent an order for
Office, and positively assured &r D a v i ~ that
to get the Ship under Way; and that if He was detained one moment, she should
sail without him. We waited a t the Palace untill the Arrival of Hsdgi Unis ben
Unis: was received by the Baahaw, in the Hall of Justice, drank Coffee and psssed
the customary complimente. Hadgi Unis ben Unis presented s very long liet in

Arabic; which, He said, was the Note of the things, claimed by the Tunisian claimants, many of whom were present, Doctor Davia answered without hessitation, or
asking their Value, that He would write to Malta and have all the things returned,
that were not sold; and that He would pay for the rest as soon as possible; a t which,
the claimants seemed perfectly satisfied. During the whole transaction, Captain
Campbell nor myself were not asked one question, nor did we, in the least interfere. - [Translation of list is in IVDA.]

the Bashaw would immediately have mid, well then, We will detain the Captain,
untill the claims made by the Moors are satisfied. I therefore thought i t most

cases, been instantly confiscated.
I communicate a11 these circumstances to Alcayde Hashash who
assured me Raiz Omnr had acted contrary to the Orders he gave hix?
in Your Majestys name, which I lost no time in writing to the Amencan Commodore, but unfortunately the want of conveyance for Malta
delayed that Letter a very long tune a t Gibraltar, in?omuch that to
this day I have not got the Commodores determination. - I have
however always entertained good hopes the busyness of the Mes[h]ouda
would be amicably accommodated. To my very great astonishment yesterday I received information
that another American Frigate had fallen in with Your Majestys Ship
Mirboka Commanded by Raiz Lubarez to the Eastward of Malaga,
having the American Brig Celia from Barcelona for Malaga with hun
as Pnze, and the Master and seven Mariners on board the Ship
Prisoners.
Raiz Lubarez confessed 'fie Cruized for purpose of takeing American
Vessels and gave up a paper in the Arabic Language d i c h he said
was his authority for that purpose delivered to him by Alcayde
Abdashaman Hashash. As my Passports were applied for and granted for the Mirboka and
all the other Vessels of War sent, out from Your Majestys Ports this
Summer, I could not but be very much surprised to find they were
authorised to capture American Vessels, as I never had received the
least information that Your Majesty had seen any cause to disturb
that harmony which so happily bad been restored and continued to
subsist, between Your Majesty and the United States of America. Under the mentioned circumstances it became the indispensible duty
of the American Captain to retake the Brig of his Nation, and also
to detain the Mirboka as she had been sent to Sea for the purpose of
making War against America. - The Navd force of the United
States at this time in these Seas is such as to afford ample protection
to its Commerce and for every other purpose it can be required; yet
as i t has ever been my steady endeavour since I have had the honour
of being placed near Your Majesty by the Government of the United
States, to do every thing within the compass of my power to maintain
Peace and Good Friendship between the Countries, so now I beg leave
to answer Your Majesty that I am highly disposed to receive such
propositions as Your Majesty may be leased to make t h o ' me for a
re-establishment of Peace, which I wdtrsnsmit to the Commanding
UfEcer of our Squadron in these Seas who is daily expected at Gibraltar, or send them on to America as circumstances may appear to
render most proper for furtherance of the Grand object in view. A first and very necessary measure for this will be Your Majesty
withdrawing the authority the Captains of your Cruhers have for

capturing American Vessels, when that shall be done they will no
longer be in any danger from the Ships of War of the United States. Alcayde Hashash thought proper to c o n h e me to his house Your Majestys known attachment to strict Justice I am fully persuaded wdl induce you to order that no such insult be offered to me
again.

DEARSIR, Your favour of the 2gtQpast I received on thursday at
noon, with news which you will have seen by my letters to Mr Gavino
I [space] but certainly did not expect a t that moment, for our Governour on a very recent occasion assured the Consuls thro. Sir Peter
Wyk that his Imperial Ma'esty did not authorize his cruisers then
a t Sea, to capture vessels be onging to any Nation West of the Straits
besides Russia & Prussia, repeatedly mentioning America as one of
the nations with whom they were a t Peace; this contradiction does
not surprise me, as I know where I am.
At receipt of your letter I immediately waited on Alca de Hashash
and acquainted him of the capture and re capture [ irboka and
Celia]you had made, when he denied in the most positive tarms Raiz

Lubarez being authorized by him or any other person to capture
American Vessels. I could only insist on the a d v m you had given
me, and he was as positive on the contrary strain. At a second
interview in the early part of the evening he was Civil, the sub'ect
was again canvassed mthout any interesting issue;
he had c h e d
me a third time to his house at eleven at mght, when I was told by
his people the Governour had retired (& I dxd not see him) but that
i t was hi^ orders I should be detained untiU suoh time as the Frigates
were released; they instantly shut the doors and there I was until
yesterday morning a t ten. My release was obtained by ta demand
made to that effect by all my Brother Consuls, but he insisted on
their becoming answerable that I should not leave the country without
previously obtaining his Majestys permission. God knows I had
no intention of going without i t - the necessary representations and
complaint on this vlolence has been laid before his Majesty by the
Cons& collectively, as well as by myself. I concfude you will have
had the paper delivered to you by Raiz Lubarez, as the authority he
had for capturing American Vessels translated, but the question is
whether you have been able to obtain a faithfull translation of it
be redly what he said it is a most material paper, I beg to have a
copy and translation of it by the earliest dire& conveyance. - I
have sent an express t o the Emperour a t [space] with my account of
what has happened, whose return I may e ect by this day week
At this time i t is impossible for me to say"gy whose authority Raiz
Lubarez acted in capturing the Celia, - by what him and his officers
told you it appears likely to have come from Hashash in whom the
Emperor has of late placed unbonded confidence, insomuch that we
have seen acts of his of a most extraordinary nature sanctioned by his
master. From whatever source the order came, I have not the smallest
doubt but the object in view thereby, was to influence the restitution
of that most unfortunate Vessel the hles[h&]
In the ni h t of
thursday a Moor had escaped from that ship at Malta arrive here,
& the Governour brought him before me on Friday, when he made a
declaration on subject of the ill treatment he said the crew met from
Captain Rodgers, in such terms as I could not possibly believe; but
a t that moment i t suited the Governour's purpose extremely, as well
as a t the conferrence with the Consuls in the fore noon, and I am
persuaded he hrts painted the whole as facts, and in very lively colours
to the Emperor. For this reason I must particularly request that
some others of that crew be examined if ossible before Hamet B i a
or some other principal Moore a t Gibrafter, on subject of the treatment they met with, that I may be prepared to efface from the Emeror's mind the im ression thts fellows story ma have made with
- In this view beg to have in writing what t om men may say,
subs'tantiated in the best manner circumstances will admit of.
You know there is an other Frrgata of this country a t sea it is to
be supposed her commander has similar Ordem as Lubarez, Lut I do
not know how it is possible to ascertain the fact, unless she actually
makes some captures, however I doubt not but she will be looked
after - it is not a t all likely she is gone to the Eastward. At this
time it appears impossible to say what may be the best termination
to be aimed a t in this most unfortunate business - some light may
be thrown on it by the Emperors answer, for I have told hun if he
desires a restoration of Peace I will be very ready to recieve his propo-

sitions, and transmit them either to the Commanding Officer of our
ships of War in these seas, or to the President, as circumstances may
appear to render necessary; - adding that a primary measure must
be his withdrawing the authority given his Cruisers to capture h e r ican Vessels, which alone could give them security with our shi s of
War. I was led to hold forth this because we have security in and
for their good behavour. War with this Country is of all others most
to be avoided, but Peace must not be bou ht on terms incompatible
with the honor & dignity of the Nation. f Commodore Morris has
reached Gibralter I persuade myself he will in the present critical
state of affairs remain untill Commodore Preble arrives, or at least
untill can transmit by him to Government the Emperours answer to
my dispatch of yesterday. - I must not omit expressing the very
great satisfaction I felt at your handsome treatment of Raiz Lubarez
and his ships Compan it does yourself honor and even with these
people must impress gvourable opinions of us not possible to be

NQ62. - Triplicate. SIR I had the honour of addressin to you NQ61 on the 15'0 last
Month in triplicate by the way of Lis on & Gibraltar. It was extremely distressing to me to find by advice from Captain
Bainbridge of the United States Frigate P h W l hia dated off Malaga
2 g t W t Qthat the suspicions I had entertained o hostile intentions on
the part of this Country against our Flag, appear to have been but
too well founded, altho' they were on such shght grounds as justifled
no more than my recommending measures of precaution. At receipt of Captain Bainbridges Letter thursd~ylast I went to
Alcayde Hashash who denied in the most positive terns either having
given Raiz Lubarez authority, or that he knew of such comeing from
any other quarter for his capturing American Vessels: this assurance
he extended to all His Majestys Cruizers, but I confess I cannot have
full reliance on all that Man says, as by subterfuge it is not uncommon
with him to evade declaring facts. - I was with him a second $ 9 0
same Evening on the busyness, without any Interesting or decmve
were unceasing at
issue, his complaints on detention of the Mes&
both interviews. -

"b

f

20

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1808 TO 1804

At eleven at night he again sent and desired to see me at his House,
as it is no uncommon thing to do busyness with Ministers and sometimes with Governours even at that hour in this Country I readily
went, when to my great astonishment the doors were immediately
shut, and I was informed bg a relation of the Governours that it was
his Orders I should be detmed - he was gone to Bed and I did not
see him so there was no remedy but submit to that gross insult, which
none but a person of his rude manners wouId have been guilty of. The only answer I received to the messages I sent was that I must
remain until both the Frigates should be set at liberty.
I will not
detain you at present farther on this subject, than to say I remained
in the same situation untill Friday at ten O'clock, when my Brother
Consuls came in a Body to demand my enlargement, on the principle
of the person of a Consul in this Country as representative of his
Nation being exempt from all Arrest.
The Governour at last consented to release me, on condition that
they became Security I did not quit the Country without the
Emperours permission. A complaint has been made to His Majesty
by the Consuls collectively, on the occasion besides what I have
mentioned to him on the subject. With this you will find copy of a Letter I dispatched on Saturday
for the Emperour at Fez,untdl we receive his answer I do not see that
any thing can be determined upon with respect to the Mirboha. I have in the mean time writt.en Captain Bainbridge fully on the
busyness, and pointed out to him what steps in my oppinion are best
to be taken to ascertain unequivocally the fact whether the Commander was authorised or not to Capture American Vessels, which is
the grand point essential to be known. From the sense I have alwa s in view of the great utility of an
uninterupted Peace with this ountry, I was induced to say to the
Emperour I was ready to receive such propositions as he might be
pleased to make for an accommodation, holdm forth as an encouragement security to his Cruizers on his with rawing the orders for
takeing American Vessels. To take upon me this measure (which I hope will meet approbation)
I had strong inducements, the first that Commerce might not meet
interuption or be burthen'd with heavy Insurance beyond the actual
Risque, the next to bring on a Negotiation with secunty in our hands
for their good behaviour in the course of which we may be able to
obtain a farther Ratification of the existing Treaty, and lastly because
if an open Rupture takes place it will be a most tedious and e
busyness to make a new Treaty and very doubtfull if will be
on such good terms as the present. The h t of next Moon is the time now fixed upon for the Emperour
setting out on his tour to Tetuan and Tangier - I should not be
surprised if this &air brings him sooner. [NA. SDA. CL,Tangier, Vol. 2, 1803-1810.1

you, that I accordingly repaired on board said Ship, where the Captain
shewed me the Passport of Mr Simpson, dated at Tan 'er, the twenty
third of July 1803, addressed to the Commanders of
united States
Armed Vessels; stating that the Shi Maimma, belonging to the
Emperor of Morocco, mounting 30 guns, and carrying 150 men,
Commanded by Hedge Tacher Aumed [?I, was bound on a c m e ,
and request6 all Commanders of United States Armed Vessels to
treat him as a friendly Vessel, he conducting himself accordingly. The Consular Seal was affixed to said Passport, the impression made
on Wax, ve clear & fair.
The said aptain Also shewed me the top of a Parchment Passport,
with a certificate thereon, signed J. Simpson, stating that it was the
true top of an American Passport. - h m the Knowledge I have
of Mr Simpson's signature, having often seen it in the OfEoe of the
Secretary of Stste, I really beleive these signatures to be enuine.
SimpThe number of Guns & men appeared to correspond with
eon's Passport.
The Captain informed me, through an Interpreter, that he had
been from Sallee 23 days - that he was bound to Lisbon, on business
for his King, and that the Emperor of Morocco was at present a t
peace with all nations. I demanded a si ht of his Commission from the Emperor of Mom?;
in consequence o which, he shewed me a paper written in Arabic,
with a Seal made with an impression from ink,which he said was h s
Commission, & the ro al seal; but as there was no one who could
translate the Arabic, ?was obliged to be satinfed with his own declaration on this point.
The Shi a peared to be quite new, was clean and in good order
about the
but appeared to be very deficient & slovenly in her
sails & rigging. She mounted 22 six pounders on her Gun deck &

NAVXL OPB2iATIONS FROM 1803 TO 1804

The reason which the Captain gave for having been so long from
Sallee was, that he had met with contrary winds, which obliged him
to put back several times.
Upon the whole, his Passports appear so clear & correct that,
according to our Treaty with the Emperor of Morocco, I should not
wnceive it adviseable to Detain the Ship, or give her any undue
molestation.

Sept 11t@ 1808 Ma2aga Roads Sunday
DEARBROTHERI arrived here from up aloft on the Ninth. I
write you this to [be] prepared against an opportunity may offer of
sending it to you. I will give you a small description of my travels
since my arrival in the Straits
I left Gibralter after laying forty eight hours. Got my provisions
and water in. Made sad with a head wind and it so continued 17
days out of twenty to which time I arrived a t Malta. I chased every
thm that had appearance of Tripolitan. I found none of our ships
a t hfalta and but httle information could I get of them only that they
had sail[ed] about forty days before. From thence I p r o d ' d to
Tripoli,saw none of our ships there -and but only two smallTripolitan
boats close in. I went close in to the Batteries & fired a shot at them.
I hove to for a short time, but I saw no Gunboats make any ap earance. I then boar away for Malta again. The batteries a t 'Tripo{ are
much improved - by their appearance they might mount 300 ieoes
of Cannon, if they had them. On my return to Malta I foun8th.t
the Enterprize had been there the day before in pursuit[?] of men; by
Commodore Morris' orders. I found that the Squadron had all been
together at Leghorn - My anchor was down but one half hour. I
proceed toward Le horn in pursuit of Capt. Ro[dlgers - in passing
round the West en of Sicily I exchanged slgnals with the Adams, Capt
Camble. I then went in chase of a Latteen boat that hove in sight.
The fellow, when he found I stood for him, fired a gun to windward in
defiance of me, but in 3 hour chase he fired one to leeward and hoisted
En lish Colors. I just drop two close alongside & he hove directly
an was very glad to find we were Americans. He mounted 8 guns.
I left him immeadiately and went down and spoke the Ahms, who
was from her hull in sight only top Gal't sail above water. Capt.
Cambell inform'd me that Capt. Ro[d]gers had gone down with a
Convoy that I should find him at B a r d o n a to which place I
procad'd. -but wind never hid'd [?] any vessel equal to this, for let me
alter the course any where I was sure to have a head in the course of a
couple of hours. On my arrival there, I sent the boat in. Cept.
Ro[d]gers had sail'd 2 days before. I then made sail with a fair m d
for the 6rat time for a month a t theU. S.N [?]at 12 next day was within
20 milpa of Allecad [?I when it came on to blow very aevere from the

south east, then had to haul my wind to keep off the land. I expected
that he had left there that day, supposing he would not loose the
Levant that had blown all that m o m g and the day before. That
night was very squally but the next day they hauld round to Eastw'd.
I arrived here in thirty six hours, I was much surprised to see Commodore's ship here - as I had no despatches for him and he had
heard that I had. I would not for one hundred Dollars been .so
disagreeably situated but I had to obey the orders of a supenor
officer - a t the moment Mr Decatur tells me there is a s uare Rig'd
vessel to windward. It must be the convoy, and I shall %is day-get
off the despatches - my anxiety mind has engross'd all my time smce
I have had them in possession.
The Schooner has not got no paint on her. The rigging is bleatch'd
as white as a sheet, and one suit of sails better than half worn. This
thing would wear the devil out in a short time if he was anywhere
forward of the main mast.
I hear that Capt Bainbridge has arriv'd & captured a Moorish
Cruiser of twenty guns & took an American brig & now in p m u i t of a
thirty gun ship to the [ms illegible] So you can tell Sally I will renig
from the prize money - for I now expect to make prizes or be a prize
but I think but little about the latter. I bid you adieu God bless you
all. I shall write often - I yesterday dined with Mr Kirkpatrick
who treat'd me as he formerly had which was very politely

she is one of a squadron of seven men of war (independant of those
under the command of Commodore Morris) which the President of
The United States, has been pleased to place under my command
for the protection of our commerce
I have perused the letter from Commodore Morris to you, on the
subject of the Capture of the Ship Mishauda by Captain Ro[d]gers:
and your AnsPr thereto; from the late conduct of the Emperors crumrs
it cannot be doubted, but that Ship was intended to be convey'd to

cruisers of the Bashaw of Tri 1 to act more efficiently against our
commerce, for it cannot be ou ted, but that she belonged to the
Bashaw at the time she was captured: but admitting she did not;
the Emperor knew of the Blockade of Tripoly by our cnrisars, and
that she would be captured if met b them. If he had not been
acquainted with the Blockade, it wo d have been roper, for Cap*
RoIdJgers to have Ordered her away on her making t e first attempt;
and to have captured her, if the Captain should have made a second
attempt
Commodore Morris has the Controul of that business, and must
act as he pleases, but if she came within my command, I should most
mrtainl send her to the United States. The Captains and Wcers
of the mperor, dare not act without his Orders On my passage hither I met with his Im rid Ma'esties Frigate
Maimona of 30 Guns and 150 men admira Hadge ?Cacher, [word

examined her papers, and finding she had your passports, treated

her as a friendly vessel, & left her The Admiral told me that
the Emperor was a t peace with all nations; But from the number of
Guns and men, he had on board, and the length of time he had been
out, i was doubtfull; and had I not most sacredly regarded our treaty,
with his Imperial Majesty I should have detained the Maimona,
until my doubts could have been satisfied: and I have now good reason
to wish I had, as I have no doubt, but she has Orders to Capture
American vessels, and may do much Mischief unless the wind favors

and pointedly distinguish, those persons who are particularly cleanly, alert and

the vigilance of the officers, and the advantages resulting from good and respectable
conduct.

At the begining of the break, the reveille is to be beat, all hands are to be
turned out, hammocks piped up and neatly stowed in the nettings; decks washed
as early as possible; the Shi wetted outside, yarda squared; a t 7 bells the Officer
of Mmines wiil have the hfarines turned out and exercised; ten minutes before
8 oClock, the hands to stand by trieing lines, colors & bell, the Boatswain & his
mates to be ready with their calls; five minutes before 8 oclock, the drummers
call to be beat, in order to call the attention to the following execution. F'recisely
a t 8 A. M., with the roll of the drum, colors hoisted, tacles triced up, bell rung, all
as expeditiously as possible, after these manouvres, the Marines dismissed and
the troop beat. When top gall$ yards are exercised they are to go up with the
roll of the drum, and crossed with a flam, in exercising top gall* yards, the order
for the Colors, tscles & bell must be carried into execution a t the time of crossing
the yards; the evening execution of this Order is precisely the same as the morning
except in time, the distance from sunset, instead of 8 oClock must be observed,
& the retreat beat, instead of the troop a t 9 P. M. the tattoo to be beat, the bell
rung and all lights put out. The Marines in harbour are to be exempted from
standing watches, and when not urgent busineas is to be carried into execution;
they are to be exempted from doing Ships duty by day; but by no means this
order is meant to prevent the Sea Officer from calling on them to do ships duty
when necessary, the intention is, that the Marines may have an opportunity of
having themselves and arms clean & decent.

remain by me as consul for the U S. In this fetter I a h that the

Davis will Write you, and you will juge my moderation in this circornstance. I wait with impatiance the friendship and Justice of The
President, and the satisfaction that may be Agmable to you Sir, the
exact declaration if I can consider myself in good friendshp with your
nation. whilst that without my consent you Left Mr Davis to act as
consul untill the Goverment should appoint another. and if Mr
Cathcart had foreseen, that as not being accepted Mr Davis could not
also have been. it would have been indifferent to me who should have
Been appointed. Desiring to hear what as Been decided between Mr

ward on Monday I dont hesitate a t addressing you, to congratulate
you on your arrival in these Seas and to assure you of my respect. Having been informed you were expected a t Gibraltar I lodged with
Mr Gavino such details on the actual state of the Public concerne
under my care, as I trust will have given you .ample information regarding them. - It is matter of great consolation to me that you are
so near me a t this critical moment. - It is not necasaary for me to
repeat to ou on Captam Bainbridges opperations - we must view
that ~ e n h a meeting
n
the Emperours Ship with the captured B
in company as a very fortunate event, for thereby a most deceitf
and crdinal conduct towards the U~utedStates has been detected,

44

--

and I trust will be so fully substantiated by the papers found on board
the Cruizer and the Captain's declaration, as to ut the matter past
all doubt. - As it is proper you should be fuE acquainted with
evev particular respecting this very interesting a,$ air I enclose with
this copy of the Letter I wrote J3s Majesty the 2q Ins*,also an Arabic
copy and translation of the answer thereto received this morning. B the Latter you will see His Majesty may be supposed ignorant of
dtiydde Hashash having directed the Captains of his Cruizers to
seize American Vessels, - however extraordinary this may appear it
is not impossible, for we have seen the Emperour place the most unbounded codidence in that Man, nay we have it from good authority
he is possesed of a Letter from His Majest containing these words
"do by Land and Sea as you see fit and I
support you." - You
will see the mode of proceeding the Emperour desires for investigating
the matter, which certainly cannot be precisely followed, nor is the
propriety of Captain Bainbridges conduct to be submitted to his
determination. In my Letter of the 34 Ins$to Captain Bainbridge
I requested he would send me copy & translation of the paper delivered
to h m as the authority R& Lubarez had for taJxing American Vessels,
the Emperours demand shews the necessity of that measure & I
trust the Philadelphia may have returned to Gibraltar that it may
be done without dela .- I would not advise the original bein sent,
but it ought to be odged so as to be within my reach sho d the
validity of the copy be denied, that refference may be had to it. With this is a Letter from the Em erour for Lubarez desiring him to
come to Tangier, before it be deEvered or that he be told of the
Emperours request, it will be highly necessary that he give a declaration stating the time when he was authorised to capture American
Vessels, where and from whom he received that authority, the time
he sailed from Lsrach and when he captured the Celia. - If he can
be brought to state these particulars with the assistance of one of the
Jews of Gibraltar acquainted with the Arabic Language it will be
essentially usefull ;- if he of himself will not state such a declaration
then in my oppinion the best way will be to bring him on board the
Flag Ship and propose questions to him to the effect of what I have
mentioned, if not inconsistent with your established Interrogations;
and the like with one or two more of the .principal persons of the
Ship, without allowing either any opportmty of knowing what has
passed with the others. - After this has been gone throu h the Letter
may be delivered Lubarez, and if you find that facts o y have been
stated in such declaration as he may make, then I hope you will not
see any inconveniency to complying F t h the Emperours wish of his
b e i i sent over here by any opportumty may offer. - Such apers
as may be necessary to send me respecting this busyness Mr avino
will be ood enough to enclose and p ~ under
t
cover to Dg Anto
Salmon panish Consul here, and they w d l reach me in safety. 15* September Noon. What precedes I had written yesterday to be in read ess for any
opportunity might offer - I have just now had the onour of receiving your Letter of the 13tQIns* and must d m i t that the observations you make on hostile intentions of the Emperour of Morocco
against the United States stand strongly justified by actual occur-

rences. - In the instance of the Mesh& I was instructed by Commodore Morris to say if the Act was that of the Master, and unauthorized by the Emperour the Ship would be liberated. - he will
now determine her fate, which certainly must be influenced by. what
has recently happened. - Mr Gavino has sent me a translahon of
the Orders given Raiz Lubarez, which appear to be from Hashash after having seen this paper I am fully satisfied the Emperour will positively deny havin authorised any such bein given his Captains, from the thorou knowledge I have of t%ese people I perfectly
believe that M ey Soliman did not know the particular Orders
Hahash a
Lubarez, but that he confided in him & has been led
into the situation he now is with the United Stabs uninbntionaly. This even admitted I will fully allow in no Justification of what has
happened, but if you find that the Emperour should be inclined to
an accommodation I submit to you whether it would not be very
adviseable to close with him on such terms as you may consider
honorable, rather than press s continuation of hostilities.

SIR,Understanding by a recent arrival that Hostilities have been
commenced against us by the Cmsiers of the Emperor of Morocco, I

embrace the earliest opportunity to inform you that on the Night of
the 13*@Instant, arrived here the Moroquin Cruiser fitted out at
SalleB, it is said witbout having made a capture; she is Ship rigged and
taunt masted, both her Bottom & aides are black exceptmg a pretty
narrow bright streak round the latter, her stern is painted Dove
Colour, but not ornamented with carved work, has a prow head resembling a fiddle head, carries 24 long sixes on the Main and 6 or 8
two or three pounders on the Quarter Deck, manned with 150 Men
and is a round sided Ship somewhat after the Greek model. Ifhat
she is after or how long she will stay is not known, the moment either
comes to my knowledge I shall immediately communicate it. You
will have the goodness to give this information to the Commodore or
to the Commanders of our Ships of War, leaving to their better judgment to act thereupon as they shall conceive most conducive to the
Protection and safety of our flag.
N. B. Since the foregoing I have learnt that one of her Mast is
sprung which she came in to repair, if this Goverment allows her to
do it sbe will probably lay here some time. She is now under Quarantine, but it IS likely will be cleared Tomorrow or next Day. [NA. SDA. CL, Lisbon, Vol. 2, 1803-1805.1

an Express to Tetuan to give Alcayde Hashash the necessary information and take his orders, which will be here tomorrow evening or
Monday morning. - This sta was indispensible or I would not have
taken it, os you will believe have but too well founded reason to
throw eve objection in the way of that Man having any thing to do
with our egotiations and if possible it must be avoided. - As the
expression in the Emperours Letter ma be taken to apply to himself
"we will examine" - some Tabbs trans ate it as carrying his intention
to have the busyness investigated under his own immediate inspection. - by the answer Alc%ydeHashash may ve that matter
will be cleared up. - Monday is the last time fixed or His Majestys

SIRThe enclosed detail will inform you of our actual position a t
Tunis, in addition to which I have the honor to inform you that I was
creditably inform'd that the Bashaws political reason for not receiving
me a t Tunis, is no other than in consequence of a request from the
Dey of Algiers to that purport, in compliance with the will of the
Sllnhedrim & their most righteous Secretary; I am consequently
consider'd by them as no longer encharged with the affairs of the
United States in either of those Regencys, & when I have offer'd to
the Regency of Tripoli the terms of peace prescribed by my instructions & dehver'd the Jewels & property of the United States in my
possession to any erson appointed to receive them, who I presume
will either be the ommander of the Station or whoever is a pointed
Consul general a t Algiers my functions will cease, unless the resident
should think proper to send me fresh instructions - If the interests
of the United States should dictate the necessity of appointing an
Agent to superceed me a t Tunis, I request Sir that it may be done in
as delicate a manner as possible, that m y reputation may not suffer
in the estimation of my fellow Citizene, and m order that I may not

be subject to the animadversions of the ignorant & malicious of whom
we have too many in the United States, I request Sir tbat this may be
consider'd by government as my resignation I am now in uest of the Comodore who I expect to find either a t
Gibraltar or M age & shall proceed to the execution of my instructions a t Tri oli as soon as he may find it convenient to take me there,
the result o which I will take the earliest opportunity to inform you of
& will from thence proceed to Leghorn to hold myself in readiness to
return to the United States on receiving the Presidents orders I should have dispatch'd a courier from Tunis but in consequence
of the Bashaws refusing our offer of an annuity a t tbat place I was
apprehensive that the Bashaw of Tripoli would be very exorbitant in
his demands unless our offers are accompanied with force, making
propositions in any other way would look as if we were tired of the war
I hope the manner I open'd the negotiation a t Tunis will meet the
Presidents approbation, I offer'd a premium to be allow'd a commercial
p r i d e d e whch we do not enjoy that priviledge was denied us, conse uent fy we are exonorated from the promise of the remiurn most sincerely congratulate the President and alf' those particularly concern'd in the negotiation for the cesqion of Louisiana as well
as my country; this event has form'd an epoch in our national history
second to none but the declaration of Independence, & while it opens
an ample field for commercial enterprize, it consolidates the Union so
far as the western territories are concern'd & prevents our b e i i s u b ject to the devices of an intrigueing ambitious & restless neighbor
which at some future period might produce incalculableconsequencesAs a number of aqpointments.must necessarily take place previ?us
to our taking possession of Louisianrt I should conceive that refrabmg
from petitioning government in due season to be merted as an applicant for one of said appointments would be acting enirnical to the
interests of my family, more especially as contrary to the example of
some Barbary Consuls I shall return home five thousand dollars a t
least poorer than I was the day I was appointed Consul for Tripok,
I therefore request you to mention me to the President & Senate m
such a manner as you may think I merit, & should I be so happy as
to succeed both the President & yourself Sir may depend upon my
gratitude for the preference shewn me & my country may depend upon
to the best of my abilities - Whether
my faithful services accord
my services gives me any c aim to public employ in common with
my fellow Citizens the President and yourself are the proper judges:
my knowledge of the languages used in that country probably would
render me as useful and I hope my character a t this period of my life
is not doubtful In whatever way the wisdom of overnment may determine you
would render me a singular service y infonriing me of my fate as
soon as possible, Mr Gavino a t Gibraltar will know where to f h d me,
I shall either be onboard our Squadron or a t Leghorn As CaptP Campbell will be a t Washington when you receive these
dispatches I refer you to him for any additional information he being
perfectly acquainted with all my operations for some time past, in

Gibrder Bay 18q September 1803 SIR, I have the honor to inform you, that the United States Ship
Constitution under m Command arrived here the 12t4instt on my
passage off Cape St incent, I fell in with the Ship Maimonu with 30
Guns and 150 Men, Admiral Hadge Tacher [word illegible] belonging
to the Emperor of Morocco, bound to Lisbon on business for his
Master, I boarded and made three several examinations of her papers
and found them, all fair, as far as we could understand them, she had
the passport of our Consul at Morocco, dated at Tangier 23=4Jul
1803 addressed to sll the commanders of the U. States armed Vesse s
stating that the Ship Maimom, belonging to the Emperor of Morocco
mounting 30 Guns and carrying 150 Men commanded by Hadge
Tacher [word illegible] was bound on cruise, and requesting all commanders of the United States armed vessels, to treat him as a friendly
vessel, he conducting himself accordingly the Consular seal was
afExed to the said passport, the Captain had likewise the top of a
parchment passport, with a certificate thereon, signed James Simpson,
stating that it was the true top of an American Passport her papers
were so fair, and clear that I could not detain her - Indeed I should
as soon have thought of detaining a British Vessel - Altho I must own,
I felt uneasy at parting with her but should have felt more so, had not
ColQLear, (who was acquainted with Mr Simpsons hand writin )
volunteer'd his services to go on board and examine the papers himse(if
he did so, and pronounced them correct, I enclose you his report to
me after the Examination I found here the Philadelphia Captain Bainbridge with the Morocco
Ship of War Mitboka of 22 Guns and 98 men Captain Ibrahim Raiz
Lubarez her prize. Captain Bainbridge fell in with the Mirboka off
Cape De Gatt with an American Vessel which she had captured in
company, this circumstance was sufficient Justification for Cap?Bainbridge to take possession of her, to prevent her doing more mischief .Captain Bainbridge was also so fortunate, as to recapture the pnze
[Celia] On translating her papers one was found to be an Order to capture
American Vessels which the Captain said he received from the Governor
of Tangier, sealed, with Directions not to be opened until he was at
* Sea - I suppose the Ship which I met off Cape St Vincent has Orders
to do the same, on her return from Lisbon, but do not suppose she will
Capture before as she has gone there to receive a present and be well
fitted in order to act more efficientlyagainst our Commerce - Captarn
Bainbridge deserves much credit for h u vigilance, and active exertions
in re-capturing the prize, as well as capturing the cruiser, and for the
humane and v e v pro er treatment, the Officers and crew of hm prize
have received, srnce t ey fell into his hands 14Q Schooner Nautilus Lt Comdt Somers, arrived from a Cruise up

17tb I unmoored, and got ready for Sea, and directed Ca tain Bainbridge to send the Moorish Captain, and the Six princip officers on

by permission of Captain Ro[d]gers I sent on board the M i s d his
prize in Consequence of the Suspension of Commodore Morris from
the Command of the former Squadroa, it devolv'd on Captain Ro[d]gers,
of course Morris hauled down his broad pendant, and Ro[d]gers
hoisted his as Commodore of that Squadron - I felt the Necessity or
propriety of proposing to Comr9 Rodgers (Notwithstanding his Ordem
to return home) that he should remain a few days longer on the Station
with the New York and John Adams, and that we should sail together
for Tangier, to assist M' Simpson in bringing about an accommodation
of our affairs with the Emperor of Morocco, which Commodore readily
assented to - And I requested Colonel Lear to accompany us, that
we might have the advantage of his able advice and Assistance in any
ne ociation that might take place t h i s Gentlemans Zeal for the public service insured a ready compliance on his part, he immediately embarked and a t Midnight we
wei hed Anchor, and sailed, and at 7 o'clock next morning, anchored
in angier Bay, with a white Flag a t the fore, as pacifically inclined a boat was sent off by Mr Simpson with an open slip of aper, purporting that he only was allowed to send a Boat to receive etters - I
wrote m behalf of Cornr+Rodgers and myself, and received Answr"
thereto which were apparently written under restraint, but Mr Simpson found an Opportunity to slip a letter into the packet, which confirms me in m first opinion that the Governor of Tangier has not
acted without &her Authority, he states that he has a scene of the
deepest treachery to unfold as soon as a rsonal interview can take
place, and that the Emperor has been gI$' ty of another act of hostility a t Mo adore by seizing on the Brig Hannah of Salem Joseph W.
Williams &aster (who was there on a trading voyage) and making
prisionem of the crew - The Governor was a t Tetuan, and no person at Tangier that had Authority to permit Mr Simpson to come off
to us, he stated that he was confined to his house m t h two centinels
a t the door this being the case, and the Emperor not expected until
Thursday we made the following arrangement that Commodore Rodgers should go to the westward and cruise off Larache, Sallee and
Mo adore and m self to return to Gibralter to give additional Orders
to aptain Bain ridge and Lieut command^ Smith, and to leave
Orders for a new disposition of the force under my command - I accordingly weighed a t 8 in the evening and Sailed for Gibralter a t 10
AM entered the Ba -found the Philadelphia and Vixenunder way I made S i a l for t e Captains, ave them additional Orders and they
left the Bay, wind westward - anche with an intention to get under
way, and be a t Tangier the next night, but the wind from the Westward has prevented us - I shall weigh this evening and proceed to
Tangier and endeavor b every honorable means to bring about an
accommodation, but if t a t cannot be done, I shall make them feel
that we are sensible of the injury & injustice they have done us, but
shall take no hasty steps, you will a t once discover my opinion of

this business by a perusal of NQ 1 of my dispatches which accompanies this; that letter was not wrote in warmth, but you may rest
assured that cringing to those Barbarians will not Answer I am
fully aware, that it is for our interest to have peace with Morocco
but it is not necessary, or proper that we should be so over anxious, as
to induce them to believe we must have it, on any terms the choose
to dictate - I have an ardent desire to do right I hope I sha - You
will have all the information in my power to give you by a perusal of
my dispatches as they are arranged, you will there be made acquainted
m t h every transaction since I came on this Station, and with some
transactions before I arrived - some of the numbers are important
documents, particularly the translation of the Order to capture American Vessels which discovers the deep designing treachery of those
Barbarians, who could give such an Order and withold a signature in
order to deny it if discovered - If their vessels of War had been successfull they would not have denied but on the contrary would have
justiiied the Order by some pretext or other; I cannot hear of their
having captured any American at Sea except the one re-captured by
Captain Bainbridge
I am weighing anchor for Tangier - Lt Gordon and the Midshipmen ordered to this Ship have joined her The Adams is momently expected here, and the Enterprize now in
sight standing into the Bay, I shall want her services for a few days
previous to her carrying the Orders N"7 into effect - I t is some
time, I believe since any of the old squadron were off Tripoli, & fearfull that the Tripolines would be Induced to think we neglected
them, I thought prudent notwithstanding our Morocco business to
dispatch the Philadelphia and Vixen to pay them a Visit, I had not
time to give Lt Comdt Smith such full Orders as I wished therefore
directed him to Sail in Company with Captain Bainbridge and follow
his directions until further Orders - I shall give him full instructions by the first of the Squadron that goes to the Eastward You will discover the disposition I have made of the force under
my command by the orders each Commander has received, copies of
which, are among my dispatches; I hope the President will approve
of the Orders I have given to the Commanders of the Vessels of my
squadron to capture the vessels of the Emperor of Morocco I conceived it was my duty, as he had given Orders to his cruisers to Capture ours - the greater the number of his Vessels and subjects we
can get into our possession the easier we can make peace with him I
have no doubt, but this business will be soon settled, and enable me
to bend my whole force against Tripoli, should I be wrong in my conjectures, I think i t will be necessary to keep a small Frigate a Brig
& a Schooner to rendezvous a t this place, and cruise along the Morocco
shore - I find it necessary to remain here myself a t present - and
hope the liberal instructions which you were pleased to give me, for
my Government, in allowing me to exerclse my Jydgment without
restraint for the good of the service, and our situation with Morocco
will justify my conduct - I think with the addition of a 32 Gun
Frigate, a Bng of 16 - 32 pound Carronades, and a Schooner of
14-24 pound Carronades I can effectually Blockade Morocco, and
Triply, and by hiring a few Gun boats bring them both to any terms

GIBRALTER,
September 18q 1803
SIR, The unexpected disposition and evidences of hostility which
have been recently given by the Emperor of Morocco towards the
United States, making i t necessary to guard, as much as possible,
against the evils which may result to the Commerce of the U. States
in consequence of such an event; I am convinced that you will not
consider it prudent to leave this station until some measures can be
taken to place our commerce in the best security that the nature of
the case will permit; I therefore conceive that I shall be fulfilling the
duty which I owe to my Country to remain here, until the Constitution, or some other proper Vessel can proceed with me to A1 ers,
without too much endangering the interest of our Commerce by eaving this important Coast unguarded: And I am the more especially
induced to this, from the instructions of my Government to have an
interview or communication with Ms Cathcart previous to making any
dispositions relative to our Maim with Tripoh and Tunis,and as the

P

arrival of the U. S. Frigate Adams, which is daily expected here, will
probably produce this desireable event.
Knowing your anxious wish to pursue such measures as, in the
unlooked for and critical state of our Affairs w i t h Morocco, may be
most conducive to the interest of our Count ,I am persuaded that the
President of the United States will wrdi y approve of any steps
which may be taken to effect this object, altho' ~t may cause a delay
in executmg your original intentions of proceeding immediately to
Algiers,

Negociation and artly by force of Arms, the Inhabitants have agreed
to pay him an In emnification of 100,000 dollars and to permit h1.m to
budd a Castle & place a Garrison on their Mountain; the Bashaw is
now sending an army to Derna to subdue his brother H m e t , who is
in possession of half that Town, but the Coast & Harbour is in the
hands of the Bashaw of Tripoli who has two Cruisers there one of 10

to men of sense it certainly could not be necessary, but to the generality
in this Country, and to stop the malignant reports most industriously
propagated by Alcayde Hashash on the Occasion, - they were
mdwpensibly requisite, and I trust they have had their full force. Yesterday I had occasion to send an Express to the. Minister, to
whom I gave full information on the subject that he mrght acquaint

SIR I have directed this to be hand'd you immediately on your

will look into Tanger Bay, and if you do not find me there, proceed

Moggadore, and stretch from thence to Cape Spartel Keep a good
look out for a ship of 30 Guns and 150 Men called the Momona
[ M a i m m ] ,Admiral Hach Tacher [word illegible] belonging to the
Emperor of Morocco. She is out for the purpose of capturing American Vessels, and if you meet with her bring her into this Bay for examination. She is about 350 or 400 Tons, Mounts 11 six pounders on a
side on the Gundeck, and 4 four pounders on her Quarter Deck has very poor quarters is slovenly about the rig&g & sails, has a

them - A Mizen Topmast m t h a very short pole head, and three reefs
in the Mizen Top Sad - a small storm Mizen -no Spanker-boom Yards all the colour of the wood - I met her off Cape St Vincent on
my passage hither. examined her passports, which were fair and proper;
and not knowing the Emperor of Morocco had made War on us, let
her proceed to Lisbon whither she was bound She is, I understand,
soon expected to return to Sallee. I t is probable some alterations
will be made in the appearanFe of the ship a t Lisbon, that she may
not answer the above descri t~on. I t will be a glorious thing for you,
to take her; You can easily c fo it, if you meet with her; and, my orders
are, that you make the attempt.
You will inform all the American Vessels you meet with, of the
hostile disposition of the Emperor of Morocco. - Cruise between
Cape Spmtel and Moggadore ten days, and if you do n o t meef,with
me, return to this Bay, and prepare your vessel for a crume m t h all
possible expedition and sail to the Eastward. Cruise from Cape de
Gat, to Cape Martin 10 days, and if you do not meet with any Tripoline or Morocco Vessels, you will proceed to Malta, and may stay
there 24 hours to Water, and gain information from thence proceed off
Tripoli to w i s t the Philadelphia and Vizen in the blockade of that

You are also to capture any vessels attempting to enter that p l m

Season will a low you to do with safety and then Harbour at Malta but I do expect that you do go out occasionally and shew yourself off
Tripoli even in that season when the Weather is most severe, as it will
have a good effect.
If you have occasion for money, for the necessary expences and
supplies of your Vessel you will draw on the Secretary of the Navy,
when it can be done, and when it cannot you are to draw on Messr+

U S SHIPCow! a t Sea off the Coast of Barbary near
CEUTA.- Sept 2Zq 1803. -

SIR I had the honor to write you the 20" and inclose you various
dispatches as pr list since which in consequence of information from
Moggadore that several valuable American Vessels were expected
there and that two Gallies which the Emperor of Morocco has a t
Tanger were about moving, I have thought proper to countermand
the orders for the Argus and Enterprize, the latter Vessel is now along
side taking in Provisions for rt cruize 08Maggadore to revent our
Vessels from entering that Port, & falling to the hands o the Moors
and to watch the Moorish Crussers the Enterprize will have to touch
at Gibralter for a few hours for additional stores I am in great want
of the Argus & Siren, a t the present moment & hope they may !eon
amve, the Nazctilw has not yet returned from Mallva the v d s
have been contratry which has prevented her from cormng dpwn mth
the convoy, I want her to watch the two Galle s and a s h p l o e e d
m t h Moorish pro erty a t Tanger & prevent t em from escapew,
until I can learn &e em erors d e t e r n a t i o n , I understood that the

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 180.9 TO 1804

before I sent the Nautilus, of course I gave Lt Somers orders to wait
a t Mallaga only 24 hours, & return to Gibraltar with what vessels he
could find ready by that time. I have been endeavoring to reach
Tanger Bay since the 20t@but find i t impossible to beat through the
Straits with a lTesterly wind. however I am still striving and shall
not anchor until I reach it. Col? Lear agrees with me that it would
be imprudent for me to leave this Station for Algiers, Tunis or Trip01
a t present and has written me a letter to that effect which you
find among my dispatches,
As the winter is fast approaching I conceive there will soon be very
little danger from the Tripolines until the spring opens in the mean
time Caps Bainbridge will be able to keep them in check with the
Philadelphia, and T'ixen, I shall send another vessel up as soon she
can be spared from this station, to convoy a vessel to Malta with
provisions of which by the way there is no great stock at Gibraltar, I
enclose you a list of all the Consul has on hand. S p t 33d -

i

Last evening I fell in with the Adams from Tunis with Consul
Cathcart on board, Cap? Cammel and A P C. came on board the
Constit&ion, The Bey of Tunis has refused to receive M r Catchcart,
and positively demands a frigate, should that demand be acceeded to,
it will require another Frigate on our own account to watch her motions. I suspect the demands of the Barbary Powers will increase,
and will be of such a nature as to make it imprudent for our Government to comply with, all of them excepting Algiers appear to have a
disposition to quarrel with us unless we tamely acceed to any propositions they chuse to make, I believe a firm and decided conduct in
the first instance towards those of them who make war against us
would have a good effect
The Emperor of Morocco has no doubt long been meditating War
with the U S. he has only been waiting for some pretext, and the
Capture of the Messuda by Cap! Ro[d]gers I suppose he will alledge
to be a sufficient one altho I think he has no cause of complaint on
that score, the Christian powers will have no chance m t h these
people until they determine never to pay tribute or supply them with
military or naval stores or ships but[?] to destroy every thing they
can belonging to them. - They send out their Cruisers, and if they
prove successfull, it is war, and we must purchase peace, - suffering
them to keep a11 they have taken, but if they are unfortunate and we
capture their Cruizers before they have taken any thing valuable it is
not war altho the orders for Capturing our vessels are found on board,
and we must restore all we take from them, which enables them to
commence again. I know not how long we shall be obliged to submit
to this sort of treatment, the Moors are a deep designing artfull
treacherous sett of Villains and nothing will keep them so quiet as a
respectable naval force near them I think Gibraltar should never be
left without a frigate and two Brigs or schooners, as they can effectually prevent any cruisers from aloft passing into the Atlantic and
a t the same time keep the Moors in check The wind has the appearance of changing in favour of reaching
Tanger, and I must for the present conclude, Mr Cathcart will forward dispatches to the Secr?of State by the Adurns and inform him of
his proceedings a t Tunis.

DEARSIR, The co~nmunicationswhich you will receive by this
conveyance from Commodore Preble, are so full and complete that
I can add nothing to them that is interesting excepting the enclosed
copy of a letter received here yesterday after (after Come Preble's

departure for Tangier) by Mf Gavino, from the consular house a t
Cadiz.-the information contained in this letter is of a very disagreeable nature; but even if it sh* prove true, I think the measures which
have been taken to guard the Coast of Morocco, on the Atlantic, will
prevent either the prizes or cruizer from getting in. - The New York
sails this day to releive the John Adums, and will probably remain on
that Station, until the arrival of the Brigs, which is anxiously & hourly
expected-I presume that ComVreble informed you of his intention
to touch a t Tangier Bay merely to see if Mr Simpson had any thing
new to communicate, and proceed from thence out of the St[r]aits,
and run along the affrican coast for a few days, untill the Emperor's
arrival at Tangier, which is expected on the 36 Octr when he will return
to this place to see if this unpleasant business cannot be settled by
negociation. He went out yesterday morning with a h e wind from
the Eastwd
I should have gone out again in the Constitution, as I have already
been out twice in her since my arrival; but the arrival of Mr Cathcart
in the Adams, From Tunis makes it necessary for me to remain here to
receive from him such communications as he has to make respecting
our affairs with Tunis $ Tripoli. - Our first trip to Tangier was on
the 16th inst. the second day after the arrival of the John Adams in
the Bay - The zeal of Commodore Ro[d]gers to do every thing in
his power either to settle this disagreeable affair with the Emperor
& q or to take the best possible measures to protect our commerce, did
not allow him to hesitate a moment about going down to Tangier
with his ship in company with the Constitution; altho he was not prepared for being out but a few d a p , and had had no oppertunity of
writing to the Nary Dept after hls arrival here. - Indeed when we
went down we had no expectation of being gone more than two days;
but the information rec* there from Mr S i p s o n (the full of which
you will have with ComVreble's dispatches) made i t necessary to
guard the Atlantic Ports of Morocco without a moments delay; and
as Come Preble was obliged to return here to give additional orders to
the Phila&? & T7izen previous to their going up the Mediterranean,
Come Ro[d]gers with A zeal & alacrity which must do him credit,
determined to go into the Atlantic & cruize as long as his provisions
and water lasted, of which he had not more than 12 or 15 days allowance. - Before we parted he requested I would state to you his reasons for not having written to you; which were, that he recvdhis instructions to take charge of the Ships returning home, only two days pprevious to his arrival in this Bay - and that the short time he continued
here, was occupied without the loss of a moment, in making the necessary despositions in consequence of the charge in the homeward bound
ships - and in concerting measures to guard agamst the evils which
might result from our unexpected difference with the Emperor, or
terminate them by a negotiation.-And his going into the Atlantic
insteed of returning here immediately from Tangier, as he expected,
must totaly deprive him of the oppertunity of writing by the Adam. The full communications from ComWreble will inform you of every
event which has taken place with respect to Morocco, and the return
of the Adums will, undoubtedly give, full information of the operations
of the other Squadron previous to their arrival here; so that Commodore Ro[d]gers will have the satisfaction of knowing that you will
receive all the intelligence on these points that his letters could have

80

given and he feels fully persuaded that the part which he has taken
in this unexpected and critical state of our affairs with Morocco, wiU
be more approved by the President than if he should have corn lied
with the strict letter of his instructions & returned immediate y to
the U. S., when i t is probable that the continuance of his ships for a
short time on the coast will be attended with very happy effects.Indeed nothing but Patriotism and a deep sence of the duty which
he owed to the interest of the U. States could have prevailed upon
him to take the part he has in this business when the term of service
and his instructions directed him homewards and under these impressions he has entered into it with his usual ardour and alacrity. The Zeal activitv and intelhgence of Come Preble must afford
satisfaction to our i'fovernment. - and I flatter myself the President
will have good cause to be pleased with the conduct of this Officer
who so far as I can observe, seems actuated only by a wish to render
the best services to his country, and make them acceptable as well
as useful. - He has undoubtedly stated his ideas of the necessity of
an additional force in these seas, even if we should make peace with
Morocco, for i t would not be strange if Tunis should break out, upon
hearing of our differences with the Emperor, and knowing that we
were not expecting it, & of course, not provided against it. I hope on the return of the Constitution she will be able to proceed
with me to Algiers, whither I am anxious to go; but I trust the present
state of our affairs here will be a sufficient justification of my delay. We have not heard any thing of the store ships sent to Algiers. Mr Cathcart informs that he heard from Algiers when he was a t
Tunis, and that all was well there as it respected the United States. Mr%ar desires her best respects and regards may be given to your
good Lady, to which I beg leave to join mine.

GIBRALTER,
September ISth 1805. to September 26" SIR,I had the honor of writing a few line to you on the 5 $ h ins!
which was put on board the Brig Jack, Captq Hashill, from Cadiz to
Cape Ann, o f f Cape St Vincents. - We then flattered ourselves with
being in this Bay two days afterwards; but the easterly winds and
unfavourable weather baffled all calculations, so that we did not
reach this place 'till the 12t@
As the information which we received on our arrival here of the
hostile disposition and conduct of the Emperor of Morocco towards
the ZIT. States, has opened a new & unlooked for scene of operation for
the Squadron under Commodore Preble, and has caused a pretty
active succession of events, I shall take the liberty of stating those
things which occurred to myself, or within my knowledge, from day
to day, as noted in my diary. On the 6t@of SeptT between Cape St Vincents & Cape St Mary's,
we fell in with a Frigate [Maimma] belonging to the Emperor of
Morocco, mounting 30 Guns & carrying 150 men; bound, as the Commander said, from Sallee to Lisbon. Neither her appearance nor
conduct discovered anythmg hostile towards us: indeed so little did
she appear like a suspicious Vessel, that the Commodore would not

have thought it worth whiIe to notice her particularly, had she not
discovered a wish to s eak with us; & finding she was a mooriah ship,
he then sent his boat &ng side, with an OBoer to make eve requisite
examination and en uiry respecting her. On his return an reporting
to the Commodore at her passport $ 9 from our Consul, Mr Sim son,
wss correct, and nothing appeared suspicious about her, the 8ommodore, who was anxious tbat we should be placed upon as much
certainty as possible respecting her, requested, that, as I was
acquainted with Mr Simpson's handwrit' & signature, I would go
on board with the Officer, and examine t e passport &? - This I
most readily consented to, and according1 repaired on board with
the first Lieutenant and a Midshipman, w en I found everything as
stated in my re ort to the Commodore, on my return on board, a
Copy of whch have the honor to enclose, (NP 1). Altho' everything appeared so clear & correct on board this Vessel, that there
could be no pretext for detaining her, and the Commodore wss f d - ~
~at~isfied
tbat he could not do it with propriety; yet such wss bus
anxiety & uneasiness lest there should be some dece tion, that
might o erata vainst the Am. Commerce, that I rea iy beleive,
had she een in s~ghtnext morning, he would have ventured to detain
her.
From this time 'till the 12tQ,we had strong easterly winds, or calms,
which revented our reaching the Straits. On $ morning of the 12'9, we entered the Straits, and stwd inta
the Bay of Tangier, with a light breeze from the westwq, hoisting the
w l o m and firing a signal for the Am. Consul to send or come off,
if he had any communications to make, and the Commodore being
very desireous of seeing him, to know, if possible, the destination of
the frigate before menboned. - Upon standing in near the Town of
Tangier, we saw the Consular flags of other nations hoisted; but not
that of the U. States; and no boat corning off, we then felt a retty
strong assurance that all was not right with the Emperor. 8eeing
no probability of a communication with the shore, we stood over to
Gibralter Bay, where we came to Anchor about 3 o'clk P. M.
Upon our arrival here the business with Morocco was explained; for
we found the U. States Frigate Philadelphia, with her prize, a cruizer,
belonging to the Emperor, called the Mirboka, commanded by
Ibrahun Raiz Lubarez, one of his principal Captains. - Captg Bairnbridge immediately came on board the Constibubion, and communicated to Commodore Preble the particulars of the Capture.
It ap ears that, on Capt-aimbrid
e's arrival here from the U.
States, e r e d intelligence that two ripoline Cruizers had been
seen off Ca e De Gata and he immediate1 went in search of them. That in l o o k g for them, he fell in with ttis Moorish Ship of 22 Guns
& 90 men. After examining her papers & passport from the Am.
Consul, and findin them correct, he was about to let him depart;
which
,
appeared to be in company with the
but seeing an ~ r n . p 8 r i ~
Crui7,er, he was led to some enquires respecting her, and their answers
creating suspicion, he had her examined, and found she had been
captured by the Cruizer, and was then in her possession; the Am.
CaptP & Crew having been put below. Ca tp B. then took ossession
of the Cruizer & her prize and brought tlem in here.

ca ture Sweeds, Danes, Dutch, Russians, Prussians $ 9 - These
o'.la, written in the Arabic language, were not signed; but the
Captain af6rmed and certified, that they were the same which he
rec* from Hashash; under a sealed cover, with directione not to open
it until he shQbe at sea; and that, when he came out, he had no idea
that he was to cruize agt the Americans. - These orders were faithfully translated into English here, and the Moorish Consul, Hammet,
of this place, saw the Original, and declared i t was the handwriting
of Hashash, or his Secretary, as he had letters from him written in
the same hand.
The Moors had been remarkabl well treated since their capture,
and acknowledged it with gratitu e. - The Capt? of the Am. Brig
which had been taken by the Moors, said he and his crew had been
very well treated by them, and were only obliged to go below when
any vessel appeared in sight which was suspected to be an Am.
Shlp of War.
A Salute was fired by the Constitution, and returned from the
Garrison, with an equal number of Guns. TUESDAY
SEPT~
13t@
In the forenoon I went, with Commodore Preble, on board the
Philadelphia, and from thence on shore, where we paid our respects
to the Governor, Sir Thomas Trigge, who received us with great cordiality & politeness. He expressed some anxiety on the subject of
our rupture with Morocco, as he said the Garrison of Gibralter was
wholly dependent upon the Moors for supplies of fresh provisions in
time of war, and he was very apprehensive lest they should refuse
those supplies, when they found we were permitted to bring their
Vessels in here as prizes. - This, however, was conveyed in a delicate manner, and without intimating that we should meet with any
obstruction contrary to our Treaty with Great Britain.
The U. States Frigate, New Yo&, arrived here from a Cruize up
the Mediterranean - And the Schooner Vixen,from Baltimore.
Dispatches were prepared by Commodore Preble to send over to
Mr Simpson, by a dispatch boat this evening. I wrote to Mr Simpson by the same conveyance (Enclosure NQ2)
I prepared Lodgings on shore for Mrc Lear & myself, and in the
afternoon we took up our quarters on shore.

Last night the U. S. Frigate John Adams, and the Schooner Nautulus arrived from a cruize, They brought several Am. Vessels under

brot in a prize; the Ship Mishouda, Capt Raiz Amaz [Omar], which
she had captured attempting to enter the port of Tripol, under the
flag of the Emperor of Morocco, altho' in her passport from MI
Simpson, blockaded ports were excepted, and she had on board a
uantity of naval & military stores, which she took in after she left
&ibmalter, and had on board a Tripoline Captain, and a number of
Tripolines more than she took from Gibralter. (This is the same
ship which had been the Tripoline Admiral, and had been so long
blockaded in Gibralter by our Vessels)

This forenoon the dispatch boat sent to Tangier, arrived with
letters from Mr Simpson, which I immediately carried on board the
Commodore, in which our apprehensions of a serious rupture with
the Emperor, are c o h e d ; but still a hope of accommodation remains. - After perusing, and considering these dispatches, it was
determined by Commodores Preble & Rodgers, that they would sail
immediately with the Constitution & John Adam for Tangier Bay, to
have further communications with hD Simpson, and endeavour to
terminate this di
eeable business by negociation. -They both
express a strong wis and desire that I would go over to assist at this
negociation (if it should take place) to which I consented, after stating
to these Gentlemen, that I had no powers vested in me to interfere in
any affairs with the Emperor of Morocco; but that my wish to be
useful to my Country, would lead me to give any aid I could in this
business. And as this unexpected event w'J make it necessary for
Commodore Preble to remain on this station until something could be
done to give Security to our Commerce, I wrote him a letter (Enclosure NQ3.) on the subject of my going to Algiers.
I went on shore, made my Cong&to the Governor, and after lacing
M" Lear under the kind care of Miss Gavino (Sister to our onsul)
I returned on board the Constitution at 7 P. M. - At midnight
weighed Anchor & stood out of the Bay.
SATURDAY
SEP@17'Q
At day light the John Adam was to leeward, standing over for
Tangier and we, being to windward, stood in, under eas sail, and
about half past seven, both Ships came to Anchor in the ay, about
two miles from the Town; with a White flag at the F. T. G. mast head
of each ship.
There were on board the Consfitution the Ca t"
six officers of
the Mirboka, and on board the John Adam, the oorish & Tripoline
Captains of the Mushowla.
Soon after the Ships came to Anchor, a boat came from the Town
rowed by 4 Spaniards, who brought an open slip of paper from Mr
Simpson, sayin the boat was permitted to come off to bring on shore
an letters the%lag of Truce might have to sand.
&mmodore Rodgers came on board the Coditution, where a joint
letter was written by him & Commodore Preble to Mr Sunpaon,
that they had come here to see if the differences could be
settle by a negociation. - That the Captains &g of the two prizee
were on board, and the papers so certified and established as to place
everythin in its true light - requesting that a roper person might
be sent o to examine the Officers $9 engaging &, security, - and
urging the necessity of a personal interview with Mr Simpson himself,
if ossible. also wrote a few lines to Mr Simpson, expressive of my feelings for
his situation, and of my desire to be useful; but tellin hun I was not
instructed by Govt to do an thing in the &airs o Morocco, and
therefore could not act offici y in them. About 4 o'clk P. M. another boat, rowed by Spaniards (not the same
which bad been offbefore) came on board from the Town. and brought

answers from Mr S i p s o n , stating that he could not come off, as he
had guards set over him in his own house; and as the Govr of Tangier
was then a t Tituan, the Officer commanding a t Tangier, would not,
or wuld not, permit him to go off. He had sent an Express to the
Emperor immediately on receiving the Commodores' letter, expected
an answer from him on Monda , and that the Emperor was expected
at Tangier on fridcly next. - esired that the Constiszltion might be
off Tangier on Monday or Tuesday, when he expected the Emperor's
Answer, and would endeavour himself to come off to the Ship. He
recommended not to send any boat on shore from the Ship. - The
foregoing is the purport of the letter which was subject to the examination of those h a m g power over him; but he slip'd under the same
cover, another letter, stating that we must look to a higher source
than Hashash, for the orders given to the Moorish Cruizers - That
an Am. Brig, the Hannah of Salem, Josh W. Williams master, which
was in the Port of Mogodore, on a trading Voyage, had been seized
on the night of the 4tQinstant, the Cargo taken from the Consignee's,
and lodged in the Custom House, and the Capt? & Crew delivered to
the Consignee upon his responsibility for their appearance. Mr S.
still
.
hoped matters might be accommodated; but those hopes were
faint. In his letter to me (Inclosure N94) he says he will open to me, when
we meet, a scene of deep deceit - which will astonish me. After perusing these letters, and writing a short answer to Mr S.
informing him that the John Adams wd go on a Cruize, and the
Constitution return to Gibralter, to be back again to Tangier on
Monday or Tuesday; it was determind that the John Adams should
proceed along the Western Coast of Morocco, as far down as Mogodore, to intercept cruizers and warn an Am. Vessels she might meet
with, of their danger; and that the dkstifution should proceed to
Gibralter, for Commodore Preble to give some additional Orders to
Capt? Bambridge, in consequence of the late information obtained a t
Tangier, previous to his oing up the Mediterranean.
Commodore Rodgers eft the Constitution about sunset, and a t
8 o'clk, both Ships got under way, for their respective destinations,
with a light air.
Commodore Preble offer'd ~ermissionto anv of the Moorish Officers
on board his ship to go on shore & relate thk circumstances of their
Capture & treatment; but they all declined; saying they did not dare
go while their men remained prisoners. - They all appeared very sad,
when theIy] found there was no probability of an accommodation a t
present.
After dark large fires were made on all the Mountains along the
coast, to give the alarm, and prevent a landing being effected from
the Ships, as the Moors on board said.
The Fort above the Town, and the Batteries in front, appear formidable; but i t is said they are in a bad condition as to thev
and
not furnished with Engineers or Gunners. - There was in t e Bay a
Ship with Danish Colours, said, b the Boats which came off, to be a
rize to a French privateer whic lay along side of her, recaptured
had taken her going into a French Port. - All

Capt-anbridge & Lt Comdt Smith came on board the Constitution,
where they rec* orders from the Commodore. The Ship Port Mary,

was under their convoy. - At 2 P. M. we came to Anchor in the
Bay, just above the New Mole. In the afternoon I went on Shore. MONDAY

The Commodore having determined to go down to Tangier this
evening, or in the mornin ,to meet Mr Simpson's further Communications, as he had desired; e requested me to go with him; and in the
Evening, I accordingly accompanied him on board; but the wind
being too light to get under way, we waited until morning. The Commodore brought from Gibralter, a Jew Interpreter of the
name of Manna, who speaks the Moorish & English languages well,
to facilitate any communications we may have with the Moors. In the evening the Commodore & myself had a long conversation
with the Moors on board; particularly with Ibrahim Rais Lubarez,
who appears to be a sensible, considerate and well informed man. He is personally well known at Gibralter, has been two years Ambassador from the Emperor to Madrid, and is a person of consideration
at home.
We endeavoured to impress them with the injustice, as well as the
impolicy of the Emperor's making war upon us, particularly in the
insiduous manner in which it has now been done, where the passport
of the Consul was obtained, which sh* be held sacred, and never
violated - That, altho' we wished for peace, yet, if forced into a war,
we should be found formidable & terrible to the Moors, as they
might well know, from what they have seen of our force - That the
kind treatment which they had r e d was not the effect of fear; but
proceeded from principles of humanity and manliness which the
Americans always exercrsed towards their enemies when they had them
in their power - That the Emperor w* be much more benefitted by
our Commerce, than he could by a war with us - That our Commerce
extended to all nations, which would enable us to c a q to the Moors
every thing they could want; besides what was roduced in our own
Country; and that we should take from them suc things as they had
to dispose of, which w*be very profitable to the Merchants, as well as
productive to the Revenue of the Emperor - That our Shipping was
very numerous & powerful - That we wg strive all in our power to
keep peace with them upon ro er & honorable terms; but if we were
obhged to go to war, we s o d not only destroy all their Vessels,
which w'J not re uire much of our force to do; but we should send
ships and batter own every Sea Port Town in the Empire

These observations appeared to make a deep impression upon them,
and brought tears into their eyes. - They acknowledged it was all
just and true, and Capt-ubarez observed, that the present Emperor
was one of the best Princes they ever had, that he was just and considerate; but that he was surrounded by bad advisers, particular1
b Hashash, who had given Orders for capturing Am. Vessels. ago declared, that if ever he got to his own country again, he would
see the Emperor, face to face, (to whom he was personally known) and
would tell him those solid truths, let the consequences to himself
be what they might. That he was full? persuaded the Emperor only
wanted to be justly informed of the dwposition of the Americans to
agree to every thmg that was right; and that the kind and generous
treatment they had experienced since their capture, would make a
lasting impression on their minds, and they would, on their return
home, endeavour to inculcate the same feelings on their Countrymen. We told him the conduct of Hashash had been so outrageous &
wicked towards us, as well as unjust towards the Emperor, that we
would never treat with him;nor with the Emperor, unless he inflicted
condeign punishment upon him, if he had acted without his orders. The acknowledged this would be right. ~ g Commodore
e
proposed to send four of the Moors on board the
New Pork, until his return from Tangier, as the captain and two others
were as many as was necessary to carry over, and such a number in
his Cabbin & a t his Table, were inconvenient to him. - They received
this with submission; but when the four had collected their things,
and were preparing to depart, they were found in Tears, at the idea
of leaving the Ship, and the Commodore humanely permitted them to
remain on board. TUESDAYSEPTEMBER

The light airs of wind and calms, did not permit us to get under

when the Commodore ordered Lieu$ Comdt Hull, to follow him

In the morning we found the current had set us above the Rock of
Gibralter, the wind having been light & variable through the night. Stretched over under the African Shore. - About 11 Oclk A. M. off
Cuta, a sudden s uall came on, which struck an English Brig near us,
standing u the%editerranean, with all her sails set, and carried
awa both fler Topmasts. - The Commodore immediately hauled up
for er to give her assistance. She sent her boat on board, with an
Officer, who informed that she was His B. M. Brig the Childers, commanded b Sir George Bolton, from Eng'J with dispatches for Lord
Nelson. &e had touched a t Gibralter, to leave letters for the
Governor, and came out this morning. - The Commodore offered
every assistance in his power, and as the Officer said Sir George wished
to go into Tituan, where there was an English Frigate which would
take his dispatches up immediately., the Commodore sent his boat on
board with a hauser to take him m tow, & carry him into Tituan,
which was then in sight. The wind freshening, we towed her a t the
rate of ten knots per hour: but soon after falling calm, Sir Q. B. came

assistance he had met with, stud, as the weather would now permit
him to get up other Topmasts and make sail, he wg do it in preference
to go%to
Tituan,, and proceed on his way. The Commodore
offered
spsrs, rig= or anything he might want; but he said ha
had eve thing on board he stood in need of. - About sun-set we left
him, wit one Topmast on end, and the other going up, and stood
with a light wind from the Westward, over to the Spamsh Shore.
THURSDAY

The wind still continuing to blow from the Westward, and the
current setting strong to the East, we could make no progress through
the Straits. - In the forenoon the U. S. Schooner Enterprize ~ a m e
out of Gibralter Bay and stood for us. - C a p t a d came on board
the Constitution, when the Commodore gave him Orders for his immediate Government, and she returned to Gibralter to take in water
&q for a cruize of a few weeks off Larache, Sallee & Mogodore.
In the afternoon saw a Ship coming from the Eastwg, which proved
to be the U. S. Frigate Adam, Capta Campbell, from Tunis, which
place he left on the 9"J instant. - In the evening the two Ships having
stretched in back of the Rock of Gibralter, Capt"ampbell
came on
board with Mr Cathcart, whom he had taken from Leghorn to Tunis,
by order of Commodore Morris: But Mr Cathcart not having been
received by the Be of Tunis, as Consul from the U. States, he was
proceeding to Gibr ter in the Adams.
I delivered to M' Cathcart a letter I had for him from the Secr of
State; and Commodore Preble also delivered to him some dispatches
with which he was charged. - Mr Cathcart delg to Commodore
Preble, for his and m perusal, a copy of his proceedings at Tunis,
which he had prepare for the Seer of State; which states his arrival
& receiption - the Bey's reason for not receiving him as Consul,
and his dispute we Dr Davis, left at Tunis by Commodore Morris, in
charge of our Affairs. Mr Cathcart informed me that he had laid out about eleven thousand dolly of the money he had r e d for the Consular presents at
Algiers, in watches, Jewelry 1 9 - which were at Leghorn, where was
also the balance of said cash, ready to be vested in other Articles for
the present; - and tbat he had there also a large sum (I undemtood
him 24,000 dollars) which he had obtained on his own credits, for the
U. States, to negotiate affairs with Tunis, and which he should account for to me. - He had left Mrq Cathcart at Leghorn, which
would oblige him to return thither, as well to bring her awaz, as to
take up, and deliver to me the Present & Cash deposited t ere. FRIDAY

We were this morning near the Rock of Gibralter, with a light
wind, which soon left us, and we lay becalmed 'till near 12 o'clk,
when a breeze sprung up, and the Commodore stood into Gibralter
Ba ,to put his &patches on board the A d a m
'$he foregoing detail of events, as the took place, will fully inform
you of m proceedings since our arriv at Gibralter; and also give a
e n e d i ea of the operations which have taken place with respect to
horocco. - Commodore Preble writes so fully to the Secretary of the
Navy on this subject, and every
else which relates to the Navy
Department, that it would be to y u n n m , even if it were

to add anything thereto. His communications will
made known to you, that you will be enabled to see

of this business.
Permit me to add, that the Zeal of Commodore Preble to promote
the interest of our Country, can be equalled only by his activity and
diligence to carry into effect such measures as appear best calculated
to restore a good understanding; or, in the event of a decided rupture,
to best protect our Commerce and injure our Enemy. - I flatter myself the President will find in this Officer prudence & good jud ement,
joined with h e s s , activity and a real wish to promote, a in his
power, the best interests of the U. States.
At any rate i t may be highly proper to have some force on this
Station, even if we should t e m a t e this affair amicably, as the late
deceitful conduct of these people proves that they are not to be trusted
to the obligation of Treaties. - The addition of one Ship and two
Brigs or Schooners, would be the least that could Keep a watchful
eye over the Coasts of Morocco on the Atlantic & Mediterranean;
but on this subject I must submit to the opinion of more competent
Judges.
i presume that M' Cathcart will send by this Opportunity, his
dispatches relative to the Business at Tunis. - He will remain here
until an opportunity offers of his going to Leghorn in one of the U.
States Vessels, so that I shall have full opportunity of communicating
with him on the subject of our affairs at Tunis & Tnpoli.
I have not heard a word from Algiers since my arrival here; i t is not
known whether the Store Ships have arrived there or not; The have
not touched here; and the communication between this p ace &
Algiers is not very fre uent, particularly a t this moment, when the
Dey has sent off the %nglish Consul, on account of some ersond
difference with him. - He is now a t Gibralter, and having ha several
opportunities of being in Company with him, I understand he expects
to return to his Post again, as he says he has received an order from
his Court to repair to Lord Nelson, now before Toulon, who will
receive orders to take him to Algiers and oblige the Dey to receive
him. Whether this will take place or not is, I confess, uncertain to
me. - Mr Cathcart says he heard from Algiers while he was a t Tunis,
and that all was well there with respect to the U. States; but he could
not tell if the Store Ships had arrived. SUNDAY
SEPTT25tb
This morning the Constitution went out with a fine wind from the
East, for Tangier, to touch there for inte ence from M' Simpson,
and then proceed to the Atlantic, and run own the Coast as far as
Mogodore, and return again into the Straits in 7 or 8 days, when the
Emperor is expected a t Tangier. The Enterprize will keep a look out
along shore for the gallies to prevent their taking any Am. Vessels in
the Straits. The enclosed copy of a letter from the Consular office in Cadiz to
Mr Gavino (NP 5) r e d this day, brings unpleasant intelligence - But
I have strong ho es, that if the Vessels there mentioned have been
captured, they
be retaken before they reach their ports of destination, and that the Frigate also (which is undoubtedly the Mahmm)
will be taken; for besides the John Adam, there will be the CM18titution out this day - and tomorrow the New York takes the same

I must now close my long, and I fear tedious, narrative, as Commodore Morris informs me he shall get under way in an hour. - I
hope the President will ap rove of the step I have taken to remain
here until something can e determined, with certainty as to this
business with the Emperor, rather than to take one of our Vessels
from the coast a t this moment. - Whether this affair be speedily &
amicably concluded with the Emperor will depend upon hs success
or our's. - No doubt remains on my mind, of the Orders for capturing
Am. Vessels having proceeded from him; and if his Cruizers shs be
successful, he will avow it; if otherwise he may deny it, and readily
place things upon the footing they were before. But another evd
may spring from this. - It is not unlikely but Tunis, hearing of our
differences with Morocco, may break out upon us, either with or
without a retext. - When the Adam left that place, there was
nothing in&ating this disposition; but we know that these people
only wait a favourable opportunity of making heavy captures without
re ard to treaties or promises.

It was very fortunate Captain Bainbridge met his Cruizer with

of their intention out of all doubt. - Be that as it may the Emperour

by the paper I send you with this.
I also enclose a copy of the Orders Arraiz Lubarez had for takeing
not only American JTesselsbut also the property of Americans on

American Nation to maintain Peace and Friendship with His Imperitd
Majesty, I am ha py to tell you that the Commodore is highly disr d to gratify d s Majesty in the accommodation of the differences
as arisen between the Nations, and that the Restitution of the Ship
Mirboha with all the Moors in his possession will not be a barr thereto, - when His Majesty shall be pleased to restore the American
property detained at Mogadore or elsewhere and Ratify the Treaty
made between the United States and his Father of Glorious Memory,
that perfect Freindship may again subsist between us. - As we
cannot believe His Majesty authorised the breach of Peace we have
experienced, it is but Justice to both Nations that whoever h e been
the cause of the present differences be exemplarily punished to deter
others from doing the like a t any future day.

I arrived here last night from a cruise along their coast was in

so c osely watched that it will be for their interest to have
which I have no doubt will be established in a very few days. ut to

I do not believe we have an m c e r in our service that would be willing
to attempt to cross the Atlantic in her for ten times her Value. I have

in our ossession and to withdraw the o;ders I have given
turing .boorish Veasels, on certam condihons which my
2ljt@UltP to MT Simpson {a copy of which is inclosed) will explain to
you, the Emperor of Morocco has such an extensive sea coast on the
Atlantic, and is so advantageously situated on the Straits for annoying our commerce that i t is very much for our interest to be on good
fermswith him, Kis 30 gun ship [Maimona] which I met on my passage here arrived a t Lisbon has not trtken any thing and is ordered to
remain there until peace is restored. The threat I made on my arrival
to sink that ship or any other of hls cruizers, that I might meet with &
the active Vigdance of our squadron has had a good effect on the
Moors. I have no doubt but this quarrel will eventually be for our
advantage, as I do not believe his Imperial Majesty will be disposed
to War with us again, & we shall get clear of having any thing to do
with Ashash the former Governor of Tanger who has ever been
opposed to our Interest. - The John Adams & New York will
remain a few days longer until all is settled & I hope by the last of

TANGIER
$9 October 1803. DEAR
SIRThe accompanying Letter for you was put up on thursday
in hopes I might have found means of conveying it to ou - but the
meet you in
Weather has been such since then I conclude this
Gibraltar Bay. Enclosed ou have the Ministers answer to what I wrote him on
Wednesday ast - in order you may receive dl these papers before
an Easterly Wind, I send t h s Boat on purpose with them, that you
may determine how far you may consider it proper to meet His
Majestys earnest desire of having his Ship brought to this Bay. The excessive bad Weather has delayed his Journey exceedingly,
on Friday my Express found him encamped at a short distance on the
other side of Alcassar River, and Hashash on this side of it, but their
communication perfectly cut off the River being im assable, but on
Rafts supported by Goat Skins filled with Wind. Man passed
and was brought back in that way. As we had very little Rain after Friday at Sunsett I conclude the
Emperour will have been able to pass the River yesterday Afternoon
and that we shall see him on Tuesday. - I wish l k n to be here before
you whether you bring the h4irboh.a with you or not - if you come
without her we shall have a violent dust with him, for His Majesty
is allowed to be as positive a Gentleman & strong headed as any
Man can be. - However on this occasion we must not be an attom
less strenuous for securing a permanent Peace to the United States,
so far as any engagements of these people can be deemed security. By the enclosure with this, you will see the Minister threatens vengeance on the author of these troubles, and he well deserves i t ; - most
probably tomorrow we shall know his fate As you will now meet his Majesty here, I submit to you whether it
will not be well to shew him all your force; and as he has disavowed
any intervention of War with the United States, ou will be the best
judge how far it will or not be consistent to pay
honours a t our
first arrival in the Bay; - perhaps it might be well to send in a s r i g
or Schooner first with a Flag of truce & let her Boat bring me a Letter
from you in answer to which I shall immediately acqutunt you what
farther may have occurred, which will be some guide to you. - I

deliver her up in as good or better order than when detained by us,
together with all the Moors in our possession - & I certainly shall
not deliver up either vessel or people previous to a renewal & ratification of our Treaty. I wish exceedingly to see you on board if only for

SIR I have duly received the letter you did me the honor to write
under date of the 5 t@ of September. - Since my last no event worth
of relating respecting the war with Tripoli, has come to my know[
edge. - Mr Cathcart after having been rejected by the Dey of Algiers
as Consul from the U. States near that regency, was named by the
President as consul for Tunis, with certain powers to negotiate towards
an accomodation with Tripoli, to this end he embarked on board of
one of our frigates to proceed for his destination, but on his amval,
I am informed, was unconditionally refused admission, although he
was the bearer of the accustomed presents on reception - we must
therefore presume, that the same reasons which influneed the Dey
of Algiers, have actuated likewise the Bey of Tunis. - inclosed you
will find the Copy of a letter I hare just received from the american
Consul a t Malaga, by which ou will percieve Sir, how alarming is
our situation with regard to M?orrocco. I have been verbally advised
that three american Vessels have been captured, the truth of this
information I cannot vouch for. - i t is in Conjecture alone I can find
any cause for these outrageous acts of Violence, so I therefore attribute
them to the capture of the Tripoline admiral by ComQMorris. this Vessel was sold to the Emperor of Morrocco, and suffered to
depart from Gibraltar on this express Condition, that she should
proceed no farther than Tunis, but having been overtaken in the
waters of Tripoli, was viewed as an infraction of the Stipulation, and
therefore captured. - the rinciple for which we contend with
Tripoli, is a principle, if esta lished, would strike a deadly blow to
the political existance of all the barbarg regencies: i t is for this reason,
they will avowedly, or in a more concealed manner, make i t a general
cause. - not knowing the address of my brother, I have taken the
liberty to inclose a letter for him.[NA. SDA. CL,Leghorn, Vol. 1, Oct. 1793-Dec. 1806.1

TANGIER
gtQOctober 1805
SIR,By the translation of papers I have had the honor of transmitting you, you will have seen the desire his Imperial Majesty has
repeatedly express'd of remaining at peace with the United States,
than which, I am persuaded few things of that nature can be more
desirable to our Government, or more necessary for cherishing the
Extensive commerce of our Country, to this quarter of the world,
free from that burthen of heavy insurance, which is ever its bane I t was on this principle I have so much recommended to you readily to meet his Majesty on this pacific disposition - for the furtherance of that desirable issue to the present misunderstanding, the
restitution of all captures on both sides can only extend to deprive
you of the miserable vessel the Mirboka, whilst you are certain of
releasing a Brig with a pretty valuable Cargo to a Citizen of the
United States - we have beside the chance in our favour of other
vessels having arrived at Mogadore, & these his Majesty also promises to restore, to whatever extent the may be I t is no uncommon thing amongst ations to agree to restitution
pf Captures on both sides to bring about accommodations - in this
?stance it appears we have a rospect of the advantage being on our
side, and in point of National gonor, since his Majesty has so repeat-

KT

116

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1805 TO 1804

edly disclaimed having given authority either for Captures of the
Celia, or detaining the Hannah a t Mogadore, he thereby endeavors at
an acknowledgement of the fault You have Also seen the Anxiety his Majesty expresses for the
restitution of the Mishouda; when I received in June last the first
notice of that Vessel's being detained I was authorised by Commodore
Morris to say to the Emperor that if the attempt to go into Tripoly,
was an act of the Commanders unauthorized by his Majesty - that
the ship should be released - I made that Communication immediately to quiet his mind, as we were a t the eve, of his cruisers going to
Sea, and the Straits totally destitute of Vessels of War of the Un~ted
States for the protection of our commerce I t has fully appeared that his Majesty left the sole direction of this
Ship to that Abominable Character Alcaydi Hashash, and as his
Majesty did not himself give the Orders to Arraiz Omar, or Issue the
passport given in his name, stating that the Ship was his: - we may
equally suppose he was Ignorant of the prohibition stated in my passport for the Ship, against her entering blockaded ports If Commodore Morris saw cause to release the Ship on it's being
roved the fault lay with Omar, and authorized me to say so to the
Emperor, he may expect an equal Friendly part from us: - on the
blame's resting with the Governor These are arguments for the Ship's being restored; but however by
no means conclusive. So it may be argued that the occasional suspension of the blockade of Tripoly takes away that consequence
stamp'd on regularly maintained blockades by the Law of Nations,
and the Declarations of the chief powers of Europe on that subject,
in the year 1780.
What I have now most to recommend to your serious consideration
is, that in every other point we have seen his Majesty disposed to a
perfect reconciliation with the United States, and when I quote to
you the following paragraph of a letter written to me, by the Secretary
of State 21" of Octr 1802 -you will I'm fully satisfied say with me,
that the restitution of this Ship to the Emperor (under the special
condition that neither the Vessel nor any part of the stores on board
of her, shall be sent to Tripoly during the Continuation of the present
War, between the United States and that Regency) should not be
suffered to stand in the way of so desirable an event, as peace with
this Country - The Paragraph is as follows
l'Should money or it's equivalent be found an indespensable agent
"in fixing the Emperors disposition to peace, you already know
"that Commodore Morris has a small fund on which you may
"draw; - be as sparing of expence however as possible; both from
"a regard to Oconomy, and to the policy of keeping down the
"hopes, and pretentions of these mercenary powers, In no event
"you are to exceed Twenty thousand Dollars; nor to go as far as
"that sum, unless it shall produce a firm peace, and an express or

Tangier Bay, October 8th, 1803.
SIR: I am honored with your favor of this date, and have duly
considered its contents, and think your arguments so far conclusive,
that I shall not hesitate in giving up the 2llurboka, and am authorized
by Commodore Rodgers to assure you that he will do the same by the
Meshouda, on the emperor's renewal and aclcnowledgement of the
treaty of peace and friendship, entered between the Emperor, Sidi
Mahomet, his father, and the United States, in the year 1786, and the
fulfilment of his promise to release all American property and citizens
he may have in his possession.
I am fully aware of the happy combination of circumstances which
has facilitated that so much desired object of our Government, without the agency of money, or even the promise of any future tribute or
present, either of which must have degraded us in the eyes of these
barbarians, and would only have been a prelude to greater insolence
and demands.
If the arguments adduced in favor of the restoration of the Murboka
and Meshouda should appear rather specious to the Secretary of State,
I feel confident they will give place to the importance of the object
accomplished thereby. Indeed, your extract from his instructions
assures to us his approbation of the measures we have taken for the
security of our lar e and increasing commerce to this part of the
world, by the estabkshment of an honorable and permanent pence.

SIR, I received yours of the St?' Ins! in Answer to my Note of the
7th - I have to inform you that the Officer Commanding the Pnze
Ship Mabocka saw the person named Josh Dunberran on board his
Majesty's Ship Medusa - You must therefore be deceived by the
Man's having changed his name
I have the honor also to inform you, that those men enter'd voluntarily in the United States to serve Two Years and a t a time when
they knew his Britanic Majesty was engaged in a war and not during
the peace as you have been informed - All persons onboard our Vessels of War are enter'd in the same manner and we only require of
them a performance of their engagements, therefore we by no means
"do a violence to the law of Nations by forcibly detaining them" as
you have asserted, but on the Contrary, You, by detaining those men
whom I have demanded "as Deserters $ Fellons" assume the Violating hand and deny us the Justice which is the basis of that Law,
While Sir I assure you, that you will always find on our part a desire
to render you ev'ry just claim and to give you in.every instance all
the satisfaction in our power that is Consistent m t h Reason & propriety, permit me to hope it will be reciprocated by the Commanders

SIR I am happy to tell you I have at last overcome the
many objections made to puting the addition I required to the paper
sent me last Night, and that by tho enclosed translation thereof you
will see the Enlperour has ratified the Treaty made with his Father,
of consequence I hope you will now put Arraiz Lubarez in possession
of his Ship, that His hlajesty may see his Flag flying on her. - I
am promised a Letter for the President more fully to express the
Emperours resolution of maintaining Peace with the United States,
but the Minister said in order that he might be able to state in it a
good reason for that dete~minationit would be expected His Majestys
request of having the Meshouda put in his possession would be
granted. - The arguments I urged yesterday to you and Collonel
Lear in support of this measure have still their full force in my mind,
and now we have got the Emperour in a good humour with us, assuredly it cannot be well to hazard loseing what we have been for years
striving to gain, for such a trifling object - but I would still advise
that if this Ship be given up it shall be on the express condition that
she remain in one of the Ports of this Country during continuance of
the War between the United States and Tripoly. [LC. EPP,

TANGIER
B - 4 ~U. . S. Constitution 11t h October 1803. We have been cruizing in Streights of Gibraltar for these 2 weeks
without meeting with any success. We returned to Gibraltar &
after remaining there two days came here for the purpose of accommodating matters with the Emperor of ;Clorocco. Hash hash the
Governor of Tangiers gave orders to his vessels to cruize against all
Americans, after having procured passports for his ships from our
Consul Mr Simpson. By which means whenever one of his men of
war fell in with one of ours they produced these certificates & of
course were allowed to proceed without molestation. The Philadelphia fortunately fell in with an Amer-rig
[[Ceia]that had been
captured by one these vessels & recaptured her. He also fell in with
the captor [AIitboka]which he took also. Hash hash as soon as he
heard of the capture of this vessel confined M' Simpson & would
undoubtedly have put him to death had not the Consuls of the
European powers interceded in his behalf & wrote on to Fez informing
the Emperor of this outrage. He came to Tangier the other day
with an army of fifteen thousand men. On the gt5 instant Commodore Preble went on shore accompanied by Col. Lear, one of our
midshipmen & myself. We were introduced to his Majesty with
very little ceremony. I had connected with the idea of Emperor of
Morocco, something grand, but what was my disappointment a t
seeing a small man, wrapped u in a woollen heik [haik] or cloak sitting
upon the stone steps of an o d castle in the middle of the streets,
surrounded by a guard of very ill looking blacks with their arms
covered with cloth to prevent them rusting. We stood before the
Emperor with our Caps in hand & the conversation was carried on
by means of an interpreter. The Emperor said he was very sorry
that his Governor had behaved so much amiss & said he should
punish him "more than to our satisfaction". That was his expression.
After having assured us of his ignorance of Hash hashs proceedings,
he promised not only to ratify & confirm the treaty made between
the U. S. & his Father Muley Soliman [sic], but to write to the President of the U. S. that altho' the treaty made by his father was to have
effect but for 50 years he will consider i t as bindmg for ever. Wa

man $ to all appearance very much our friend. - The prize is given
up & the Emperor has issued an order to the Governors of the different
districts of his Empire to release all vessels that may have been
detained in any of his ports & henceforward to receive all American
vessels as becomes a favored nation. The Comr goes on shore every
day for the purpose of settling all Merences. The Emperor departs
to day with his army & leaves his prime minister to manage things as
shall seem best to him. Hash hash goes with the Emperor, it is
supposed, to be executed. Tangier is a very inconsiderable place &
the natives are excessively savage. It is matter of astonishment to
me that a people living so near a civilized nation as Spain should not
imbibe some customs less barbarous than such as they have been
accustomed to. We shall shortly go to Algiers from thence to Tripoli
& then take up our quarters for the remainder of the winter a t Malta.
I am affraid that we shall have some diiificulty with the British.
Several of our men have deserted & have taken up their abode on
board some of his B. M. Ships, & the Commanders have refused to
deliver them up, & threaten to take from us as many British sub'ects
as we may have on board of an of our vessels. I think they a d not
find it the most agreeable j o they ever entered upon. I should
have no objection to that sort of thing, if they would in return give
up to us all the poor Americans they have impressed. I am affraid
i t will be a business not easily effected. For i t appears to me a matter
of impossibility to draw a proper line of distinction, by which we
may know an American from a British Seaman. Mr Smith sent the letter I gave him for you by the Adams Commre

Commences with fresh gales from the Eastward. The Xew York
got under way from Tangier bay & stood out for us under her topsails
& jib. a t 1. A. M. the wind increased, the weather thick & unpleasant, At 7: past 1 the N. York made the signal for speaking us,
we hove too with our head to the Sq in a suitable situation for speaking
the h7.Y. we lay expecting she would heave too some small distance
to windward of us, but she nun within twice her length of our gangway,
the dangerous situation in which we were plac'd required an Immediate manoevre, the N Yorks helm by her steerage must have been
hard a starboard & then hard a port, in this manner the N. York came
within once her length of our gangway a t which t,ime the Helm was
put to Starboard with an intention if possible to shoot ahead of us,
but instead of bracing the yards to the wind they were left in their
original position; (Square) the rapidity of her coming too in a few
moments, brought them flat to the mast, and there being a very heavy
sea forc'd her broad side on our larboard bow, & brought her with a
dreadfull crush on board of us. In this critical moment the distruction of the brig appear'd inevitable. Orders was issued from Lieu!
Stewart to put the helm up & shiver the after sails, by this well tim'd
manoevre we only lost our jib boom, spritsail yard, Larboard cathead
& bow anchor, the New York sustaind much more damage having her
fore, main & spritsail yards broke in the slings, in this situation she
sent her boat on board of us with a packet for Lt Stewart to send by
one of the convoy to America. At 4 made the signal for speaking one
of the convoy, a t the display of which the Ship Friendship hove too,
we lower'd down our boat & sent i t on board with our dispatches for
America when the boat returnd we hoisted her up. At 6 left the
convoy haul'd our wind & stood to the N. E. lid [tacked] occasionally,
made & took in sail as the wind would permit.
Meridian fresh gales & squally with rain.

SIR It is with pleasure I announce to you the renewal of Peace
between the United States & Morocco. The enclosed documents will
inform you that the Treaty of 1786 is ratified by the present Emperor
I hope and trust that this important object bas been effected on as
favourable grounds as was anticipated b our Government. I offer
for your consideration, not only the enc osed papers, but beg leave
to refer you to the Secretary of the Navy whom I have advised of the
most m u t e transactions before, and during our negotiations with
His Imperial Majesty Enclosed is a letter from the Emperor to the President of the
United States. I t seems that His Majesty is very desirous of a correspondence Indeed he appears very much hurt, that he has not
recQany letters from the President. I beg leave to suggest whether
the answering this letter, and afterwards to send him one annually,
might not have a good effect, for as far as I am capable of judging
the native deposition of these Barbarians I think them highly susceptible to attentions of this kind - I however submit thu matter

SIR: I have the honor to inform you that I arrived here this day,
and ?s the Nautilus was4in s%ht to the westward, I made her signal
to joln me, considefing ~t of unportance to displsy as respectable s
force to his Impenal Majesty's view as possible. Several letters
passed between Mr. Simpson and myself. Among my despatches you
will find arranged aU my correspondence since I have been on this
station.

140

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1803 TO 1804

October 6th. Mr. Simpson paid us a visit on board the ship; informed
me that the Emperor was momently expected.
The New York and John Adams joined company. Our ships are
constantly kept clear for action, and men sleep a t quarters.
I sent a boat on shore with a letter to the Consul. The letter was
delivered, a r ~ dthe boat returned without molestation. At 2 P. M.
the Emperor arrived, and in consequence of his declaration that he
was pacifically inclined, I ordered the ship dressed, and a salute of
twenty-one guns, as a compliment to his majesty. The morning
following he received a salute from the other ships. All our salutes
were returned.
October 7th. The Emperor sent a present of ten bullocks, twenty
sheep, and four dozen of fowls, for the squadron, as a token of his
friendship.
October 8th. The Emperor appeared on the beach with his court
and army, for the purpose of viewing the squadron. I saluted him
from the ship, and was complimented with a return.
October 9th. The Emperor gave an order, under his seal, for the
release of the brig Hannah, her cargo and crew, detained a t Mogadore,
and appointed Monday next to grant Mr. Simpson and myself an
audience. The proofs which the Emperor has given of his pacific
disposition, since his arrival, inclines me to believe that our differences
will soon be adjusted, and peace full restored. The weather has
constantly been very stormy for severa days past.
October 10th. The prize ship Mwboka arrived here from Gibraltar
by my orders. I gave those orders to enable me to restore her to the
Emperor as soon after the adjustment of our differences as possible,
to get clear of the trouble and expense of the crew.
The Syren passed to the westward with a convoy of seven sail of
American vessels. I landed at Tangier about 11 o'clock in the forenoon, accompanied by Colonel Lear, Mr. Morris, as Secretary, and
two midshipmen. At one P. M. with the addition of Mr. Simpson to
our company, we were all conducted to the castle, and were soon
ushered through a double file of guards, and conducted into the
presence of the Emperor. Mr. Simpson and myself were desired to
advance close to his majesty; the other gentlemen were kept back.
We conversed with him by means of an interpreter. He expressed
much regret that any differences had arisen between the two nations;
disavowed having given any hostile orders, and declared he would
punish those of his Governors who had. He said he w?s a t present
a t peace with the United States, and wished to contmue so. He
promised to restore all American property, and release all our citizens
that have been or may be detained in consequence of ofders from apy
of his Governors. We assured him, on our part, that lt was the wlsh
of the President of the United States to be on terms of peace and
friendship with his majesty; and I promisod to deliver up to him the
Murboka, and all other vessels of hls nation that may have been detained by any of the vessels of my squadron, and to recall the orders
I had given to capture Moorish vessels; and observed to him that I
was authorized by Commodore Rodgers to say he would restore the
Mesh&,
but that we expected his majesty to ratif the treaty made
by his father in 1786; this he promised most sacred y to do, and said
his friendship for the Americans should last forever, and increase in
strength in consequence of our disposition to oblige him. At two

i

o'clock, Colonel Lear and the other gentlemen, not admitted to the
audience, returned to town. Mr. Sirnpson and myself finished with
the Emperor, after his having assured us that whatever his prime
minister should do with us, should be sanctioned by him, and receive
his seal; and that he would authorize him to do whatever we pleased
to a& of him, as a proof of his declarations. We were then conducted
to a building in the castle, where we had a long conversation with the
minister. I endeavored to impress on his mind the advantages of a
free commercial intercourse which they might have with all nations;
and that the revenues of the Emperor arising from that source, would
be much greater than any thing they could expect if at war with us;
as I should immediately blockade all his ports, and not suffer a vessel
of any nation to enter or pass out; this appeared to have its full weight.
He assured us every thing should be settled perfectly to our satisfaction. I ordered his majesty's colors to be hoisted on board the
Murboka to gratify him.
October 12th. I received the orders of the Emperor, addressed to
all his Governors and ofiicers, for the release of the Hannah, at Mogadorc, and all other vessels, &c. detained; his declaration, or proclamation of peace, and his ratification of the treaty, all with the imperial
seal. I this day delivered up the Jdurboka to the Moors, agreeable
to my promise, and Mr. Simpson and myself had an audience with
the prime minister, who delivered me a letter from his Imperial
Majesty to the President of the United States, expressive of his
friendship for our nation, and his ratification of the treaty. The
ori,&mal Arabic and translation of the letter, and translations of all
the other papers relative to the treaty, I shall forward to the Secretary
of State, under cover to you, and shall send you copies of the whole,
a t the same time, in my despatches.
October 13th. Peace having been re-established, I despatched the
Nautilus to hlogadore, to carry the news, and the order for the release
of the brig Hannah and crew, and to recall the Enterprise, cruizing off
that port, m d sent orders countermanding those for capturing Moors.
The passage to Mogrrdore is fourteen days by land, and not more
than forty-eight hours by water, with an easterly wind, which is now
blowing a fresh gale. The Syren entered the bay; I immediately
despatched her for Gibraltar, and sent letters to pou and to our
Consuls at different ports in Europe, with the n9ws of peace, and
ordered the Syren to prepare for convoying a number pf merchant
vessels from Gibraltar to Leghorn, which have been waiting several
days for the settlement of our affairs with Morocco. The John Adams
left the bay for Gibraltar.
October 14th. Commodore Rodgers, for the first time, landed with
me, and, on our return, Colonel Lear accompanied us on board the
Murboka, to estimate her value, and I hope the United States will
make some allowance to the ship that captured her, as an encouragement to the officers and men. In the evening the New York left the
bay for Gibraltar.
October 15th. Having settled every thing here, a t six in the evening
weighed and sailed for Gibraltar, saluted the garrison, and had an
equal return. In the whole of this business, I have advised with
Colonel Lear, Mr. Simpson, and Commodore Rodgers. I am confident we have all been actuated by the same motives - the good of
our country; and I hope the President will approve our conduct.

142

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1803 TO 1804

I lost one of my heavy anchors, and a part of a bower cable, in the
bay, and, as the buoy rope arted, I could not recover it, although
several trials were made; I a o lost half my stream cable; both were
cut by the rocks.
October 16th. Arrived a t Gibraltar, and anchored. The Syren
getting ready for Leghorn; and the New York and John Adams for
America. I shall wait here a few days for the Enteqwise, Nautilus,
and Argus; and proceed to Algiers. The Nauiilm mll go with me;
the Enterprise will follow, as soon as she is new rigged, and has s convoy to take up: The Argus, Lieutenant Hull, I shall leave on this
station this winter, and until she can be relieved by some vessel from
the United States; as i t absolutely necessary that one vessel, a t least,
should always rendezvous a t Gibraltar, and show herself in Tangier
Bay, and along the Morocco coast, occasionally. If this is done, we
shall always be good friends with the Emperor. Mr. Simpson can
give notice of any unfriendly appearance. I beg leave to recommend,
in the strongest terms, the necessity of sending out, in addition to the
present squadron, one of the small frigates and a brig or schooner, to
remain on this station. I could call the frigate to my aid, if Tunis
should threaten, and the schooner or brig would always be ready to
come with despatches, while the frigate could remain here, if Morocco
should again break with us. However, I do not believe they will;
but it is best to look out for them.
While I was absent from this bay, four men, belonging to the
Philadelphia, and two to this ship, deserted from on board the prize
ship in this bay; three of them got on board the British frigate Medusa,
Captain Gore, and were refused to the officer of the prize, who went
and demanded them. The Medusa is now a t sea, but expected in a
few days. I have a letter prepared for the captain, which, I think,
w i l l bring the men back. I shall write you more of this business when
it is concluded. Mr. Cathcart is here, and will proceed to Leghorn,
in the Syren, to deliver the public property to Captain Stewart, to
be transported to Algiers for Colonel Lear. I shall, agreeably to
Colonel Leafs request, ve Captain Stewart orders for that purposes.
1 expect to be able to eave this bay in eight days, for Algiers, and
from thence off Tripoli. I do not expect to do much this winter, but,
when the s ring opens, I hope to convince the Bashaw of Tripoli
that it will e for hls interest to have peace with us on our own terms.
I am confident that more active exertions have never been made by
the same number of ships and vessels, of any nation, than have been
made by the ships and vessels of the United States on this station,
within these four weeks past. I have much pride and pleasure in
making the assertion, as it adds reputation to our navy in the o inion
of other nations. The ships sail this evening for the United tates.
My time is ve much engaged in the various duties that call for m
attention, and hope you will excuse any want of information whic
I may have neglected to give you.
October 17th. The ships not being ready to sail, I kept my letter
open, and have the pleasure to acquaint you that the ship Betsy
Wallcer, which loaded a t Norfolk, for Algiers, has delivered her c
there, and anived here this da . Every thing stands fair and frien y
a t that regenc , but I much ear some accident has happened to the
other ship loa ed a t Norfolk, as I have not heard any thing of her.

which being competent to their duty; and have also taken the boatswain of the New York, and the gunner of the John Adam, to 6ll

I t is absolutely necessary that every article of the provision, &c.

UNITEDSTATE'SSHIPConstitution
17th. October 1805
SIRCaptain Stewart of the United-State's Brig Siren, has reported
to me, that Joseph Dunbeavan, Thomas Pierce, and William Hughes,
deserters from the United-States' Squadron under my command, are
detained on board his Britanic Majesty's Ship Medusa, under your
command. The above named deserters, are subjects of, and have taken
the oath of allegiance to the United-States; and I now demand them
as such, and have n right to expect, that you will deliver them up to
the Officer who will hand you this.
Your Officers committed an unjustifiable outrage, by forcibly
detaining a deserter from the Service of the United States, a t one of
the landing places in Gibralter; protecting him from the Midshipmen
who were sent on shore to recover him,and transporting him to the
Medusa; and I regret that I have reason to suppose, this conduct of
your Officers to have met with your approbation. On your part,
this is so very extraordinary, and different from anything that any of
our ships have heretofore met with, on this, or any other Station, that
I must confess myself a t a loss to account for the sudden and inhospitable change of conduct towards us. I presume i t cannot be authonsed
by your Government. If so, I wish to be informed of it. If you
decline satisfying me on this head, I must apply to the Admiral, and
a t the same time, I shall make a representahon to my Government.
The Officers of our Navy, have invariabl given up deserters from
the British Navy or Armies, on the first app 'cation; and have a right
to expect the same liberality on your part.
I am not willing to believe i t is your intention to encourage desertions from our Shps, by affording your protection to every one who,
has an opportunity to claim it; if it should be, i t will throw into our
Ships, every man who, has conducted improperly, and has teen
treated according to his demerits, who has an opportunity to desert.
I now take the liberty to inform you, that I know of no such person
as s British Subject, on board of an [of] the Ships of the S uadron
under my command : I know them o y as Oifizens of the Unite States,

who hare taken the Oath of Allegiance to our Government, and have
volunteered their Services.
I presume this notice will induce you to give such orders, as will in
future prevent any of your Officers from attempting to entice, or
forcibly take from, any of the United-States' Officers, the Men placed
under their charge, either in Boats or Prizes; as I shall consider every
such attempt, in a National point of View. It is my duty, and that
of every Officer in our Service, as carefully to avoid the commission
of, as the submission to, Injury or Insdt.

SIR, My last (duplicate of which I have the honor to transmit by
this conveyance) was down to the 26 of Septr - On that day the
U. S. Frigate New 170rk,left this bay on a Cruize off Larache, Mogodore & C - On the 2gth the U. S. Frigate John Adam returned
from her cruize, without having met the Moorish Frigate Maimona,
which was the object of her search - At the same time our Consul,
Mr Gavino, r e d a letter from Mr Jarvis, our Consul at Lisbon, informing him that the said Frigate had arrived at Lisbon on the 13tQ
ultimo, without having captured anything, so that we were happily
releived from our anxiety occasioned by the report from Cadiz of her
having taken 4 Am. Vessels.
~ U. S. Frigate Constitution came into the
On the 30t@OF S E P Tthe
Bay, the weather having been so bad for some days past as to make
her continuing in the Straits, not only useless, but even hazardous.
Commodore Preble stated to me the information he had reca from
Mr S i p s o n relative to our affairs when the Constitution was off
Tangier. - The Emp' of Morocco denies having given orders to capture Am. Vessels - has liberated Mr Simpson from his confhement ordered him not to have any communication with Hashash, nor attend
to any directions he might give - expresses a strong wish to be at
Peace with the U. S. agreeably to the Treaty of 1786 - proposes
that what has been taken on both sides shall be given up - and that
the affair of the Mwshouda, taken off Tripoli, under his flag, be investigated and decided upon equitable principles. - He is expected
a t Tangier on Tuesday, when the commodore intends going down
with the Constitution to meet him, and requests that I will accompany
him,which I readily consented to do. I n the afternoon of this day (Octr l e t ) the U. S. Brig Syren, Cap'
Stewart arrived from Philad*
On the 2s' the U. S. F. John Adams sailed from Gibralter Bay to
go off Larache &p to meet the New York, and return with her to
Tangier Bay to join the Constitution, and display before the Emperor
a respectable force, and be able, in the event of decided hostility, to
shew him that we were able to injure him more than by capturing
his Vessels. On the 3QCommodore Preble recQ dispatches from Mr Simpson,
enclosing his further correspondence with the Emperor & his Prime
Minister on the subject of our Affairs; stating that the Empr was
sincerely disposed to eace, and desired that the Ship Mirboka shg
be brot to Tangier to f e del' up to him, in the event of an amicable
adjustment of our difIerences - that he had given an order for the
release of the Am. Brig. Hannah, Crew & Cargo detained a t Mogodore,

wh shQbe delg up without loss -and earnestly desired the Commodore
might meet him a t Tangier. - M' S i p s o n recommended that the
Mirboka she be brot down, agreeably to the Empr'q wishes; which
the Commodore determined to comply with, and accordingly sent
a Lieut. and 20 men from his own Ship to put her in order and take
her over to Tangier when the Constitution she sail, wQ wd be this
evening. And orders were given to Cap! Stewart of the Bri Syren
to sail at the same time, with a convoy of Am. Vessels boun to the
Westward, and proceed with them 20 leagues out of the Straits. We got under way about 7 o'clk with a light air of wind. - The Syren
&. her Convoy got under way at the same time; but without much
prospect of getting out of the Bay with this light wind. -The Mi~boka
not being quite read7 the Lieu? on board was ordered to follow the
Commodore to Tanger as soon as ossible.
On Tuesday the 4'9 we reached $angier Bay, and came to anchor
about 12 o'clk, within a short distance of the Forts. - At the same
time the U. S. Schooner Naululus, Capt Sommers, came to Anchor
in the Bay - we having met him off Tangier, and the Cornd?giving
him orders to that effect. A boat was got ready to send on shore from the Ship, to bring off
any communications wQMr Simpson might have to make, when her
going was rendered unnecessary by a Spanish boat coming off with a
letter from him to the Comd%a;ving that the Empr wd be here tomorrow, and request5 that the ComdWould, if agreeable to his own
ideas on the subject, dress ship, and salute the Empc on his arrival,
as he conceived such a complimt wd be attended with good effects. The Cornd' readily agreed to it. After sun set, all hands were called to quarters, and every thing
prepared for Action; which continued so through the night; the men
sle~pingat the Guns. (The same order was observed every night
until our affairs were fully settled with the Empr) This was a very
proper and judicious measure to prevent the possibility of a surprize
by an attnck from the Forts, if they shd be disposed to annoy us; and
it had a most excellent effect on the Moorish Capt" Officers on board,
by convincing them that the Ams. wg never be taken by surprize or
unprepared.
On Wednesday the st@the Empr arrived at Tangier about 2 o'clk
P. M, when the Commodore saluted him with 21 Guns & dressed
Ship. - In the evening a boat come of7 with a letter from hlr S i p s o n

which was returned by the Forts, with a like number of Guns for

In the forenoon Mr S i p s o n came on board the Constifutwn for
the first time. - He observed that the Empc had sent him word that
he might either go off to our Ships, or the boats might come on shore
with perfect safety, and that all things are, as they were before. This permission was given without any application on the part. of
Mr Simpson, - MT S. expressed a full expectation of everything berng
perfectly adjusted; but that nothing wg be done until the arrival of
the Minister from Tituan; and indeed he expressed a wish that the

Empr might not be pressed to an attention to our affairs until the
Minister's arrival, lest he shd authorize some other person to adjust
the differences, who might not be so well disposed towards us as he
knew the Prime Minister to be. FRIDAY

In the morng the Comd%ent a boat on shore, with a flag to carry
a letter to M' Simpson. - At noon the Empr appeared on the Battery,
for the purpose of having a better view of the Ships. The Cornd"
upon seeing him there, saluted him with 21 Guns, which, it appears,
had a very good effect upon him. - In the afternoon he sent off to
the Ships a present of 10 Bullocks 8: 20 Sheep, which was considered
as a strong evidence of his wishes for an accommodation, as it had
never been customary heretofore to send presents of this kind to
Men of War, until after the Commanders had landed and had an
audience. SATURDAY
O C TstQ
~
Mz Simpson came off this morn5 to Breakfast, when we had much
conversation with him on the subject of settl! our differences with
the Emperor. - On his return on shore Mr S. found a letter for him,
from the Empr enclosing an Order for the release of the Vessel, Crew
& Cargo detainded at Mogodore, signed by himself B sealed with his
private seal, without any conditions annexed to it; and appointed
12 o'clk on Monday for an audience to be given on the subject of our
affairs. SUNDAY
O C T9.
~
The weather was too bad to admit of any communications with the
shore. A strong gale of wind from Wr with heavy squalls & violent
rain, continued all day. The Ship's cable was cut off by the Rocks,
and finding her birth very bad, the Comd"ot under way in the afternoon, stood out of the Bay, & retd again to a new birth. MONDAY
OCT' 10t@
At 11 o'clk A. M. Commodore Preble & myself went on shore,
having recd satisfactory assurances of safety & permission to return
on board. - On reaching Mr Simpson's House, the Sweedish, Danish,
Dutch, French & Spanish Consuls called to pay their compliments.
At 12 07clk,a message came from the Castle that the Emperor was
ready to receive us. We repaired thither, and after waiting a short
time, were conducted through a narrow passage flined with the
Emperor's guards) leading to a pair of large folding doors, which
appeared to open into an interior apartment of the Castle. - When
we had got wthin 20 paces of the folding doors, the Empr made his
appearance, from a side passage, near these doors, and seated himself
on the Steps of them. - The Moors bowed to the Earth, and we, as
requested, uncovered our heads. - After this ceremony the Empr
sent his Prime Minister (who had arrived this morn$ from Tituan) to
Mr Simpson and the Commodor, to assure them of his friendly dispositions towards the U. S. - his regret a t what had happened, wh
he declared was without his Orders, and his readiness to do whatever
might be desired to restore harmony and a good understanding. He hoped that his Ship wh had been captured by the Phil-wd
be
restored, together with his subjects in our possession, as he had given
orders for the restoration of the Vessel &F detained a t Mogodore: and he also expressed a wish that the Ship Mishouda, wh had been
taken e n t d the Port of Tripoli, with his flag, might be given to him

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS

149

as a favor, declaring that if the Capt. had attempted to go to Tripoli,
it was contrary to his orders, and he shq answer it with his head. He acknoudedged that her attemptr to enter Tripoli made her a good
prize to us; but he requested her restoration as a favor (and particularly as Cornr$ Morris had, upon her being captured in May last,
written to Mr S i p s o n , saying, that if it was shown that the act of
her going to Tripoli was without the Empr'Mrders, she shd be restored
to him. The purport of wh lettar had been communicated to the
Empr) and declared that if she shQbe given up she shg never go beyond
the extent of his own dominions while we might be a t war m t h
Tripoli.
In answer to this the Empr was told, that we were equally desireous
of peace & friendship with him, provided it could be received on a
permanent & solid foundation; - that we only wanted a Solemn &
formal ratification & confirmation of the Treaty made with his Father
in 1786, with the best assurances the nature of the thing w* admit,
that i t shq not be violated or altered, on his part, during the term for
which it is to continue - That what we had done was only in consequence of the conduct of the Commander of his Vessel, which he had
disavowed - that we were perfectly ready & ~ d h to
g give up his
Ship Mirboka and his subjects, upon a ratification being made, and
a certainty that all Am. Vessels we had been, or might be detained in
his Ports, or captured by his cruizers shc be given up with their
crews & cargos, without loss; but that the restoration of the Mishoada
wG be a subject of further considerstion. - To all this tbe Empr
readily assented, and then desired that the Cornd$ & Mr Simpson
might advance nearer to him, which they did, within a few paces. While there, they had a further conversation on the foregoing subjects;
when the Empr assured them he wd grant all we had nslied, and wg
empower his prime Minister to settle the business immediately, to
our entire satisfaction. - Mr Simpson informed the Empc of the
unworthy treatmt he had re& from Hashash, the Govr of Tangier,
who had confined him without just cause, and contrary to our Treaty
made with his father, which he considered FLS a high indignity offered
to the Eation which he represented, as well as to himself. - The
Empr declared it was done without his order or knowledge, that i t
was an aggression improper & unmerited, and that i t shQ never
happen again. - The Comd"nfornled him that he had his Ship
Mai[m]orna,with his high Admiral, in his porver, but had let her pass
in friendship, finding she had the regular passport from our Consul;
but that we could have no confidence in future in passports, or any
other documents, if the late instance of them was not disavowed &
corrected. - He also expressed to him,in strong language, the superior
advantages which he wg receive from a full & secure commercial intercourse with the U. 5. n + ~ ,tho' prepared for war, and always ready
to meet it, if necessary, yet preferd peace & commerce. The Empr attended to these obserrations, again repeated his strong
desire to be on the best terms with the U.S. and his readiness to ratify
& confirm our treaty of 1786, in evidence of this disposition. - He
said the Ship ii4aimona had no orders to capture Am. Vessels, wp was
a proof that what had happened with the other Vessels was a mistake,
and could never have been sanctioned by him. - He said he shd m i t e
a letter to the President of the U. S. confirming all he had said. After the audience was broken up, the Prime Minister took the

150

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1803 TO 1804

Cornd?& Mr Simpson into an apartment of the castle, when he had
a conversation m t h them on the points before stated, and promised
that the letter to the Presidt of the U. S. the order for the restoration
of all Vessels wh had been or might be detained or captured, and the
other documents shq be made out without delay. The Ship Mirboka arrivc in Tangier Bay while we were with the
Empr and anchored near our frigates, which afforded the Emp: an
opport? of maks a comparison between his ship & ours as to size. At the same time the U. S. Brig S y ~ e npassed down the Straits, with
her convoy from Gibralr - We dined a t Mr Simpson's, and retd on b'J
the Constitution after dinner. - The Moors, as we passed through the
Town, expressed by their words & looks, the high satisfaction they
felt on the prospect of o w differences being amiccably settled. TUESDAY
O C Tl~l t h
Comde Preble went on shore this forenoon to have a further conference with the Prime Minister on our Affairs. - He had the letter
fm. the Empr to the Presidt of the U. S. and two orders prepared (one
to go by sea and one by land) for the release of the Vessel a t Mogodore,
and all others W Q had been, or might be taken or detained. - I t was
intended to have been made a point with the ComdWhat in future no
passport for a Cruizer shg be demanded of our Consul, but in writing,
under the seal of the Emp' to prevent his Governors from obtainf
them as had been lately done: But as this was a subject in wh the other
Consuls were also deeply interested, and as they had determind to
make a joint application to the Empr thereon, i t was tho? best to
waive it, for the present, and unite with them in this business.
The subject of the restoration of the Ship Mishouda to the Empr
was again mentioned a t this meeting; when finding it was requested
as a favour, and under the restrictions before ment? - and seemed to
to be a thing W Q wg be highly gratifying to the Empr who had already
shewn so earnest a desire of being upon the best terms with us, and
especially too, as Come Rodgen, (under whose controul she was since
the departure of Cornd$Morris) had, this morning, very readily consented to release her, if it could be productive of good to us, particularly
after the letter WQ had been written to M' Simpson by Come Morris Come Preble did not hesitate to say she shg be restored. - This was
r e d with strong marks of sensibility & satisfaction. The Empr ordered that the U. S. Ships of War shg be furnished with
20 Bullocks - 50 Sheep & 100 doz of fowles, which was a very extraordinary supply. WEDNESDAY
OCTS 12f4
I went on shore early this morn5 with Comd"reble. - R e found
the Empr on the point of departing for Fez, and his prime Minister
was soon to follow him; but, previous to his going, he sent for the
Cornd?& Mr Simpson, to whom he recapitulated the Emperor's strong
assurance of peace & friendship, and his readiness to evince this disposition by every means in his power; - and expressed the high satisfaction of the Empr on being assured that he shg have the ship Mishouda
restored to him; and again declared that the Moorish Captn of that
Ship sh'J lose his head for daring to disobey the Empr:' orders in
attempting to go into Tripoli.
We retd on board after an early dinner, when the U. S. Brig Syren
corning into the Bay, the Comde did not permit her to anchor; but
put on board her letters to be forwarded to our Consuls a t Malaga,

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS

State & Navy Departmtq - and ordered her to Gibralter to get

At the same time he dispatched the U. S. Schooner
up the Mediter"

release of the Am. Vessels &9 - and dxected Capt Sommers to return
immediately to join him a t Gibralter. - The U. S. F. JnQAdam, left

I went on shore with Commodores Preble & Rodgers. - The
letter from the Emp' to the Presidt of the U. S. was copied & translated, and the other papers prepared. - In the Even4 the U. S. F.
N. Yk got under way for Gibraltar. Information was r e d from our Consul a t Gibralter that a yellow
fever of a very malignant nature had appeared a t Malaga; in consequence of wh all communication with that place & other Ports of
Spain was cut off - and adviseing against having any communication
with Vessels from there. FRIDAY

I went on shore in the forenoon with Com'Jf Preble, when all the
business with the shore was ultimately closed. We retd on b'Jin the

retd with an equal number of Guns.
SATURDAY
OCT: 15tQ
We anchored in Gibralter Bay about 10 o'clk A. M. where we
found the I?.S. FQ?
N . T'k & JnQAdams & Brig Syren.
1 have now, Sir, given you a detail of occurrences up to the 15'0
of Oct: and for a more full & satisfactory acct of the transactions with
the Empr and the ultimate adjustmt of our differences with him, I
must refer you to the copies of the various letters & documents of
every descnption, W Q will be transmitted to the Secy of the Navy &
yourself, by Commodore Preble, who is as indefatigable in furnish4
full information of every thing wh occurs, as he is active & able in
- - events, wQ may render such communications necessary &
producing
agreeable.
I trust the President will receive, with full satisfaction, the news of
our differences wQMorocco being settled almost as soon as he will hear
of their have5 assumed a serious aspect. A concurrence of fortunate
events put into our hands one of the Emp'P frigates, and about 160 of
his subjects; and the juncture of the outwq & homewg bound Squadron,
a t this place, in a critical moment, gave an opp? of displaying a large
force - effectually protecting our trade - and striking no small
terror into the inhabitants of the coast. -The activity of the Squadron
was equal to its unexpected appearance. - Every Seaport in the
Empire, from Mogodore to Tituan, had one or more crumers off, to
prevent the entrance or departure of any Vessels. - The Emp: came
to Tangier. - Our frigates were drawn up ready toedestroyhls town,
if he shg be determined on hostilities. - The unpression was strong; and, the Emp: not only disavowed, in the most positive manner, every
thing that had been done on his part of a hostlle nature; but offered
anything we could ask. - A very important point with us was to
obtain a full & une uivocal ratification of our Treaty made with his
s a t once complied with, and not a demand
father in 1786. - ~ B i was
or intimation of the expectation of a present from us, either in a gross

152

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1803 TO 1804

sum, or by way of annuity. -Thus was that business, which threatened
serious evil to the commerce of the U. S. in these Seas, happily terminated in a few days.
In giving up to the Emp' his Ships & subjects, he had an evidence of
our readiness to oblige him, and to cultivate a further good understands; a t the same time it was not injuring or disobliging ourselves in
any degree; for the ships were scarcely worth tak5 to the U. S. and his
subjects were an espence & burthen upon us. - I t is, however, presumed that, as they were acknowledged to be fair prizes, the U. S. will
pay to the Captors accord5 to their valuation, as a due encouragemt
for exertion, and a reward for the readiness with WQ they were resigned
without a reservation. I n giving up these Vessels we can only be said to give a quid pro
quo; for we understand that the AIR. Brig detained at hlogodore, had
a valuable Cargo, mostly of India goods, wh n-Qam; to considerably
more than appraisemt[?] of the ships. Before I close this subject, I must do justice to the active & judicious
as well as the disinterestedness
measures pursued by Comd"reble,
with wh he appears to act on all occasions, by sa ling that the spirited
& determined manner in wh he wrote to Mr irnpson, on his first
arrival, request5 that the same might be communicated to the Empr and his subsequent conduct corresponds with that determination,
has been productive of very happy events. - The disposition made
a t Tangier had, undoubtedly the good effect to prevent any intresgues
being used to turn the Empr from his purpose of a satisfactory accommodation of our differences; for the best Houses in the Touv belonged
to the Consuls individually, or nationally: and their being fully persuaded that the town wQhave suffered, probably have been destroy'd,
in case the business shd issue in a complete avowal of hostilities, kept
them a t least quiet, perhaps might have influenced some to endeavour
to promote an accommodation. - Com*e Rodgers deserves great
credit for the cordiality $ activity wh wQhe has cooperated in such
measures as were intended to promote the best Interest of the U. S. And, indeed, the conduct of the commanders of the Vessels engaged
in this service, appeared to be influenced by the same desire to terminate this business speedily & happily, that actuated the person who
conducted it. But notwithstand6 this business has been brol to this favorable
issue, and has terminated in a way that astonished all persons here,
acquainted with Barbary Affairs; particularly as the Empr has lately
tho! proper to increase the tribute on some nations, wQ has been
acceded to; Yet I still entertain the opinion I had before, vizt, that if
they shd have captured a number of Am. Vessels, before their Cruizers
were stop'd, and their ports blockaded, the thing wd not have been
disavowed; but if we had been solicitious for a peace, it could not have
been purchased on any tolerable terms for less than 50,000 doll?and perhaps on no terms wd our former treaty have been ratified &
confirmed; for it is considered by far the most favorable that any
nation has with the Empr - And I am also fully of opinion that this
Coast shQnever be left entirely destitute of armed Vessels, while it
may be tho$ any ways necessary to keep a force in these seas. I have no doubt but we are perfectly secure agt molestation from
them, for some time to come; and, in the meantime, Come9 Preble
will make such arrangetF for security here, as his present force will

2

WARS WITH BARBARY POWEBS

153

permit, consistent with his other objects; but if all the force now here,
be wanted a t Tripoli, and addition [sic] will become necessary for
this coast.
In conversation with M Simpson, he mentioned to me repeatedly,
with deep regret, that the Emp' had never been noticed by our Govt
for many years past, even so much as to have written him a letter,
and he has reason to think that this is considered as a pointed neglect;
and that the long-promised gun carriages have never been furnishd,
confirms the idea of our hold6 him in contempt. - Our peace is now
renewed & confirmed, as far as the forms of these people ever confirm
mything, and not a word has been said, by them, about the Gun
carriages, or an intimation of a present. - This may be considered
as leave it optional as to the fulfilm! of the former promise; but wg
not good policy dictate the propriety of fulfillq it now, and maks
it appear as a new obhgation? - For I presume these people never
forget the non-fulfilmt of a promise, however justifiable a nation may
be in not complying with their engagemt* to them. - M' S. also
laments that he hears so seldom from the Departmt of State, as to be
left almost without instructions; and a t a loss to know whether his
conduct be approved of or not. - He complains of the lowness of his
salary, nnd that he has repetltedly informed Govi that be could not
continue in his place unless it sh'J be increased; and particularly as
he has no house furnished him as is the case wlth other Consuls a t
Tangier. He now has a few inconvenient rooms in part of a house
belonging to, and occupied by the Sweedish Consul. His own House
in the Country is a pleasant & convenient summer residence; but in
winter it becomes necessary to reside in Town, to be at hand to receive
or give informntio~lto Vessels
1am persuaded, Sir, you will not consider the foregoing observations
as an officious ititerference in matters + d o not come immediately
under my cognissnce; but place them, ns they truly ought to be, to
the met of my desire of giving you all the informstion in my power,

Preble, U. S. Havy

U. S. FRIGATE
Constitution
Gibraltar Bay 22" Oct: 1805
SIR I am honored with your letter of yesterday in answer to mine
of the 20th. insf.Cap-utton acknowledges having received two men
on board who say they are Englishmen. They were seen on board
the Amphion by an m c e r I sent to that Ship to make some enquiry
respecting them; their names are John Plover, and William Brown,
and both belong to this ship. Plover has alloted half his monthly pay
for 18 Months to come to his family resident in Boston. They are
both Citizens of the United States, and as such I demand them. As
you are the Sen? Officer of H:B:M Ships in this Bay, it is from you
that I hare a right to expect an order for them to be given up to me.
I was not willing to believe that it was the intention of the Officers
of the British Navy, to encourage desertion from our Service, until1
CapQutton avowed to a Lieu+of the Constitution,his determination to
afford his protection to every man who has an opportunity to claim it,
and will say he is an Englishman; and that he had given orders to the
Ofhers of his Boats to that effect. This declaration will undoubtedly
throw into your Ships every man who has conducted improperly on
board ours, and has been treated according to his demerits and that
may find an opportunity to desert, as every such man will say whatever
he finds necessary to screen him from punishment.
This treatment is so very different from anything we hnve heretofore
met with on this or any other Station that I must confess myself a t a
loss to ncct for the sudden and inhospitable change of conduct towards
us. "You say that it is not the intention of your Government to
dist,ress us", and yet the most direct means have been taken by
Captains Gore and Sutton for that purpose. I take the liberty to
inform you that I know of no such person as a British Subject on board
the Constitution. They were all considered Citizens of the United
States, when they en[g]aged with our Service, and I have not encreased
my compliment by impressing Englishmen, or receiving Deserters, of
course I have it not in my power to make the exchange you propose;
although I am ready to receive any Americans who have not voluntarily entered your service, that you are willing to discharge into this,
or any of the United [States] Ships of War.
Captain Gore has asserted, that he is convinced that if Lord Nelson
was here, he would demand every man on board our Ships whom our
deserters say are Englishmen, and ij not given u , would take them by
force. I am confident from the exalted opmion I ave ever entertained
of his Lordship from the character he has established in the world
for magnanirmty and justice that he would not demand them; and
that he will not approve the late conduct towards us.
I enclose you Circular Orders to the Captains of our Navy, which
are still in force. As they have been published in England, I presume
they must be known to most of the Bntish Commanders, who of course
will not attempt to take by force our men unless they have orders from
your Government to commence hostilities against us, which I presume
is not, and I hope never will be the case. I am confident the U:S. as
they now are so they wish to continue a t peace with Great Britain
and that the best possible understanding should exist between the
two Nations.

URITEDSTATES
FRIGATE
Constitution
Cadiz Bay dSrd October 1803
SIR, The New York & John Adams sailed from Gibraltar Bay with
a strong East Wind the lgth Ins; for the United States. By those
ships I wrote you very fully relative to the settlement of our affairs
with the Emperor of Morocco; and the disposition of the Squadron
under my command. since which nothing material has taken place
excepting the loss of 8 of our men by desertion a t Gibraltar. Their
having received 4 Months advance leaves them as yet in debt to the
Ship; and every one who receives punishment for crimes, deserts if
opportunit offers. This they would not dare to do if not encouraged
by the dec aration of some commanders of the British Men of War on
the Gibraltar Station particularly Captain Sutton of the Amphion &
Captain Gore of the Medusa frigates; that they would protect every

i"

WARS U71TH BARBARY POWERS

161

man who would claim their protection if he would say he was an Englishman. This of course every deserter will do to screen himself from
punishment.
I enclose you the correspondence between Captain Hart of the
Monmouth of 64 Guns and myself on the subject of the Men detained.
This conduct of the British in affording protection to our Deserters
will a t once ruin the discipline of our Ships if we frequent their Ports,
as every man we punish will desert if in his power, and at Malta the
Ships lay so near the shore that it will be impossible to prevent i t
which has determined me to make Syracuse the deposit of all our
provisions & Stores and the general rendezvous of the Squadron. It
IS an excellent harbour, safe and easy of access: To be sure it does not
offer the Public amusements & rare curiosities of many other ports;
but I trust we will find amusement enough in the necessrtry duties of
our Ships.
The wind still strong from the Eastward has prevented the Sven
from SaiIing with the convoy for Leghorn & Naples; and has prevented
the arrival of the Argw, and return of the Nautilw from Mogadore.
A change of wind to the Westward w
ill I trust make everything right.
In consequence of the Yellow Fever a t Malaga all communication
is cut off between Gibraltar and the Spanish Territories near it. This
prevents us from watering a t Algeciras, or the watering place without
the Rocks; and the scarcity at Gibraltar, and number of British to
be supplied, rendering i t impossible for us to water there, induced
me to come to Cadiz with the Constitution & Enterprize; to fill up
our water, and to procure a Stream Cable in lieu of the one we lost
in Tanger Bay; & a Bower Cable in lieu of an old one which we have
twice parted and has occasioned the irrecoverable loss of one Anchor
which I shall also have to replace here. Both the Cables & Anchor
can be procured on better terms here than any place in this quarter;
and as the wind is still from the Eastward, we are not losing time
I had one more object in view, in coming here, which was to shew
ourselves in Tanger Bay, and to give Mr Simpson a call on our return,
to let the Moors know that we have not forgot them Everything
however a p ears to be quiet in that Quarter and I am still of opinion
that we sha have peace with Tripoli in the Spring or ensuin Summer
I wrote you that I should leave the Argus on the Gibraltar tation to
watch the motions of Morocco until1 the Spring, I have made choice
of this Vessel more particularly on acct of the judgment prudence
a n d firmness of her Commander Lieu: Commandant Hull on whose
discretion I rely with confidence. All the Provisions that the
have on board, and all on hand at Gibraltar, will be expende by the
first of April next. If a supply does not arrive from the United States
by that time, it will distress me very much; as it will retard my
operations against Tripoli, by obliging me to seek the provisions a t
the season most proper to rtct with effect on the Tripoline Coast.
If our Provisions could be sent out in a good sailing Ship of about
Four hundred Tons, armed with Guns & Men sufficient to protect
her, and directed to proceed immediately to Syracuse, it would in
my opinion reach us with more certainty in less time and at Iess
expence to the Government than if shipped to Gibraltar; and reshiped
from thence; and if I could be allowed to detain such vessel as a Store
& Hospital Ship, i t would be preferable to landing our provisions or
men, as the men will often desert, when they recover, and no ship in

E

Port to receive them; and the Casks and Provisions are liable to
injury by being too often transported
I forgot to inform you in my former communications that Six of
the Philadelphia's men deserted from the Prize Ship, while in Gibraltar Bay; none of which have been recovered. I shall sail from
this as soon as my Cables are made, and my stock of water compleated,
which I expect will be in three or four days, and shall remain in
Gibraltar not more than 24 hours just to take Col: Lear and family
on Board, and sail immediately for Algiers, and from thence off
Tripoli M y Ship's Company are healthy. I wrote you in a former
letter, that I had sent some Invalids belonging to this Ship, and some
belon-oing to the Philadelphia home in the New York and John Adams;
that I had dismissed the Acting Boatswain and Gunner as unfit for
their Stations and that the Gunner of the John Adams & Boatswain
of the h'ew 170rk, had taken their places in this Ship They are both
good Officers. I was also supplied with 10 Men and a Boy from those
Ships but the Deserters and Invalids sent home still leave me short
of the number I brought out which was far short of my complement
I am now 40 Able & 9 Ordinary Seamen short of the complement
allowed; which makes it necessary to call all hands so often in stormy
weather and we have had no other since we came on the Station that
duty has been very hard and fatigueing. I shall be able to procure
a few men here as several have applied already to enter.
Oct. 30. We were obliged to perform quarantine 3 days after
our arrival which with the tardiness of the Spaniards in making our
cables has detained me longer than I calculated on. They make their
rigging in the open field; of course in rainy weather they cannot work.
And as i t has rained every day since our arrival, we shall be here two
or three days longer.
I have not yet heard of the arrival in these Seas of the Argus. -hope
no accident has happened to her. I shall enclose you from Gibraltar
a copy of the orders I give Lt Hull for his governrnent on this Station
when she arrives, and also a copy of the official declaration of the
Blockade of Tripoli, in consequence of the European War.
All kind of Canvas is very high Russia-Duck 28 to 30 Dollars
pr Bolt. It is probable some of the Squadron mny want some within
12 Months Will i t not be well to send some of different numbers
out by the first Store Ship?
Our Trade to the Mediterranean is valuable and encreasing.
While it has protection i t will continue to encrcnse, if not destroyed
by French prohibitions and English Blockades. The French prohibit
English Manufactures, and the English have Blockaded the Ports,
Toulon, Genoa, and Spezzia. and the coast between Leghorn and
Cape Delle Melle; and I think i t probable they will extend i t to other
Ports.
I shall write you again by a Vessel that is to Sail in a few days
from Gibraltar.

DEPARTMENT
OF STATE,
October 31.' 1803.
SIR. I acknowledge the receipt of your letters from Nv 56 to N9 60,
both inclusive. By this conveyence of the Schooner Cifizen you will
receive the so long expected gun carriages. From the pains which
have been taken in getting them ready, it is hoped that they will
prove an acceptable present to the Emperor, and you will not fail to
make use of the occasion to confirm him m sentiments most conducive
to a continuance of that friendship & peaceable intercourse which has
so long subsisted between us. If a few casks of rice can be procured
in season for this conveyance it is in tended to ship them: they may be
presented to him with the carriages, or if you think proper they ma
be retained for some future occasion which may call for such a smn 1
token of attention.
In expectaticn of soon hearing from Commodore Morris his intentions with respect to the Ship Afeshouda and in hopes that your advice
& representations would induce her redelivery, a definitive order has
not before been given for that purpose: but least any difficulty may
arise on the subject the commanding Officer of our Squadron 1s now
instructed to deliver her up, provided that your opinion of its expediency remains unchanged, and you shall signify it to him accordmgly. In that case you may, if you find it necessary, give immediate
assurances to the Emperor that she shall be returned a t the time and
in the manner you may concert with him & the commander of our
Squadron. In taking this step you will as far as is prudent give it the
appearance of a gratuitous and voluntary surrender of an indisputable
right to our desire of conciliating his esteem & obtaining n reciprocation of good offices. To guard against future claims referring to this
transaction as a precedent, it may also be observed that as it constitutes the first occurrence of the sort, which has happened between
the two Nations, we were unwilling to take advantage of tho culpable
conduct of the Captain of the Meshouda to the injury of the Emperor,
more especially as we were fortunate enough to arrest the mischief
meditated against us before it took effect, and that this act of liberality
is further influenced by the persuation that care will be taken by hls
Officers to provide against a repitition of similar infractions. You did
well to refrain from urging compensation for the freight of the Brig
Mary as suggested by the Supercargo, but you will not omit any
opportunity presenting itself, a t a more favorable season to procure
for the owners all the justice which may be attainable.

Tripoli For particulars of this unfortunate event I refer you to the
enclosed copy of my Lettar to the Secretary of the Navy, which you

state of mind must plead an excuse for the re erence. Had I not sent
the Schooner from us, the Accident might have been prevented: If
not we should have been able to have extricated ourselves from Barbary Prison, but my Motives of ordering her off Ca e Bon, was to
grant more efficient protection to our Commerce, t an I could by
keeping her with me.
I hope that you will consider the Arrangement as judicious, and
done with the best of intentions; although it has proved unfortunate.
It is with sincere pain, I reflect on my Services under your Command,
in which I had promised myself much pleasure, has been so short and
cruelly terminated.

SIR, Misfortune necessitntes me to millie a communication, the
most distressing of my life, & it is with the deepest regret that I inform you of the loss of the United States Frigate Philadelphia under
my command by being wrecked on Rocks between 4 & 5 Miles to the
Eastward of the Town of Tripoli; The circumstances relating to this
unfortunate event are: At 9 A M about 5 Leagues to the Eastward
of Tripoli, saw a Ship in shore of us, standing before the Wind to the
Westward, we immediately gave chase, she hoisted Tripolitan Coulors
& continued her course verry near the shore; about 11 Oclock had
approached the shore to 7 fathoms Water, commenced firing a t her,
which we continued by running before the Wind untilill half past

172

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROAI 1803 TO 1804

Eleven, being t-hen in 7 fathoms water and finding our fire ineffectual
to prevent her getting into Tripoli gave up the pursuit & was beating,
off the land when we ran on the Rocks in 12 feet water forward &
17 feet aft. Immediately lowered down a Boat from the Stern,
sounded & found the greatest depth of water a stern, laid all sails
aback, loosed top Gall! Sails and set a heavy press of Canvass on the
Ship, blowing fresh to get her off, cast Three Anchors away from the
Bows, started the Water in the hold, hove overboard the Guns except
some abaft, to defend the ship against the Gun Boats, which were
then firing on us, found d l this ineffectual, then made the last resort
of lightning her forward by Cutting away the Fore Mast. which carried
the Main Top Gall! mast with it, but labour & entcrprize was in
Vain; for our fate mas direfully fixed. I am fully sensible of the loss
that has occurrd to our Country & the difficulty which it may further
involve her in with this regency, and feel beyond description for the
Brave unfortunate Officers & h e n under my command, who done
every thing in their power worthy of the character & stations they
filled, & I trust on investigation of my own conduct that I will appear
to my Government and my Country, consistant to the station in which
I had the honour of being placed.
Striking on the Rocks was an accident not possible for me to guard
against, by any intimation of Charts, as no such shoals was laid down
in any on Board, and every careful precaution (by three leads kept
heaving) was made use of in approaching the shore, to effect the
capture of a Tripolitan Cruizer, & after the Ship struck the Rocks,
all possible measures were talien to wet her off, and the firmest detere up asfong as a possible hope remained;
mination made not to g i ~ her
although annoyed by the Gun Boats, which took their possition in
such a manner as we could not bring our Guns to bear on them not
after cutting away part of the Stern to effect it, when my Officers
& self had not a hope left, of its being possible to get her off the
Rocks; & having withstood the fire of the Gun Boats for four hours
& a reinforcement coming out from Tripoli, without the least chance
of injureing them in resistance, to save the lives of Brave men, left
no alternative but the distressing one of hauling our coulors down &
submitting to the enemy whom chance had befriended - In such
a Dilemma the Flag of the United States was struck however painful1
i t will be to our fellow Citizens to hear the news, they ma be assured
that we feel in a National loss equally with them, Zeal o serving our
Country in doing our duty, has placed us in that situation, which can
better be conceived than described & from which we rely on our
Countrys Extricating us. The Gun Boats in attacking fired rincipally a t our Masts, had the directed their shot at the H$ no
doubt but they would have kil ed many.
The Ship was taken possession of a little after sun set & in the
evening myself and all Officers with part of the Crew were brought
on shore carried before the Bashaw who asked several questions from
the Palace the Officers were conducted to the House which Mr Cathcart lived in, where we lodged last night & this day t'he Minister has
arantee to the Bashaw for us Officers and we have given
become
paro e of honour - Enclosed you will receive a list of the Officers

a plan as possible, the remainder of the Crew will be supported by

We have all lost every thing but what we had on our Backs &
even part of that was taken off, the loss of the Officers is considerable
as they were well provided for a long station - Mr Nisson the danish
Consul has been extremely attentive, 8: kindly offers every service

SIR, I wrote you on the Is! inst. informing of the distressing event
in the loss of the United States Frigate Philadelphia on the Rocks
off Tripoli; since then, owing to the assistance of their Gun boats,
and a strong Resterly wind that came on about 40 hours after we
struck, which raised the Sen, so as to enable them to get her off; this
still adds to our calamity, but feel conscious that it was morally
impossible, situation as we were, to effect it: however distressing it
is to us, we feel some consolation in knowing that it is not the first
instance where ships have been from necessity (of running aground)
oblidged to surrender, and afterwards got off by the enemy, which
could not have been effected by the ships company; - witness the
Ilanibal at Algesiras, the Jason off St Maloes, and several others.
We are confined to the American Consular House, notwithstanding
our having given our parole of honor.
When a vessel of the United States appears off here, if she hoists
a white Flag at the Fore & fires a Gun, and should the Bashaw hoist
a white Flag 8: fire a Gun in answer, I presume a Boat with an Officer
would be safe to come on Shore; - this I am told is their method.

Particulars of that unhappy event; The following bearings were
taken from the Place where the Ship grounded - The Westennost

of a Mosque near the Danish Consuls flag staff S W b W; Fort English
to the East of the Town S W: bearings taken by point of compass When the ship grounded her head was N E - After giving up the
chase in pursuit of the cruizer, striking on the rocks was as unexpected
to me as if it had happened in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea:
Immediately laid all sails aback, ran all the guns aft; Sounded and
found a sufficient depth of water astern, and a small distance from
Each Side: a consultation of the ofFicers was called when it was unanimously agreed to heave the guns overboard and start the water;
this was done as expeditiously as possible and a fire kept up a t the
Gun boats from our stern and Weather Quarter Guns: In firing the
lower stern chasers the stern caught fire which was put out without
much confusion: the gun boats carrying brass 18 and 24 Pounders
were keeping up a fire a t us but directed their shot at our masts.
Finding that the Guns & water did not lighten her sufficient the
Officers were of opinion that the foremast should be cut away which
was done but without the desired effect. A reinforcement of five
more Gun boat coming upon our lee Quarter where it was impossible
for us to fire a gun except down in the water; and the Veather Guns
could not be depp[dessed sufficient to heave within the distance of
the boats; At 4 P. M. every hope was fled of our being able to get
her off, and not the GsSt power whatover of injuring our enemies,
and saw no alternative but our eventually becoming prisoners tf
Tripoli; A Council of Officers was called when they were unanimously
of opinion that it was impossible to get her off the rocks; ,4nd that
continuing in our present situation would be only a sacrificing lives
without effecting our enemy or rendering the least service to Our
Country; In such a dilemma too painful to relate, the Flag of the
United States was struck I trust that a want of Courage can never
be imputed where there is no chance of resistance - distressing
indeed to brave minds to be obliged to surrender without having had
an opportunity of defence - Some Fanatics may say that blowing
the ship up would have been the proper result. I thought such conduct would not stand acquitted before God or Man, and I never
presumed to think I had the liberty of putting to death the lives of
306 Souls because they were placed under my command, And those
persons who argue thus to have been in our situation would no doubt
have had very different Ideas. I have zealously served my Country
and strenuously endeavored to guard against accidents, but in spite
of every effort misfortune has attended me through my Naval life. Gaudaloupe and Algiers have witnessed part of them, but Tripoli
strikes the death blow to my future Prospects, M[t]hough I am conscious that my conduct will bear the nicest investigation, but I am
no stranger to the censure of an ungenerous world & the regrets &
mortifications which are incident to a change of public opinion which
does not always follow meritorious exertions And an accident although
occasioned by circumstances which no prudence could foresee or
valor countroul may weigh against years of Arduous Services P e t
I have consolation in believing that my friends are too sincere to lot
adversity of fortune change their opinion

26 Novem. 1803
SIR,Since the first instant I have-written you seven letters announcing the unfortunate loss of the Umted States Fn ate Philadel* under
my command, on rocks 434 miles distant from t 's place, which are
not laid down in any Chart; presuming that you must get the information before this can a e v e to you, makes me forbear particulars on
the distressin event, havlng already detailed them to you.
I severely eel the loss which my country has Sustained; but feel
conscious that no impropriety in truth can be attatched to me, and
have not a doubt on investigation but it will appear so to my Government. Still I am no stranger to the censures of an ungenerous World;
and the premature opinions, which are too hastily formed on the m s fortunes of the unfortunate: but I trust that an accident occasioned by
circumstances which no prudence could foresee, or valour controd,
will not weigh against years of zealously serving my countqy. Every
imaginable precaution was made use of to avoid the danger, and when
it was encountered, all which Seamanship could possible dictate, was
acted upon to be relieved from it. Courage had no chance of resistance, the ship laying Six feet out of water on rocks, and creening in
such a manner as to make ever Gun useless. I hope Sir, that you will
do me the justice in believing t at I neither wanted firmness or courage
in the distressing situation: I trust no act of my life will eyer justify
such an opinion. The only alternative left of becoming prisoners to
Tripoli, was that of blowing the ship up; - some Fanatics may say
that was the proper one to have pursued; had they been placed in our
situation (which never can be concieved but, by those who may sadly
experience it) I doubt not but they would have thought very different.
I never resumed to think that I had the liberty of putting to death
306 Sou s because they were placed under m command.
The Gale of Wind which came on about orty hours after we surrendered to the rocks raised the waters on this Coast so as to get the
ship off much damaged, her keel &C, broke; this added to our distress;
but feel conscious that it was morally impossible for us to have effected
~ tWe
; were not Gods to foresee the Wind, and to know that the Sea

L

would so rise; and had we bee^ apprised of it all, it could have availed
us nothing; for in far less time than that period, ten Gun boats carrying
18 & 24 pounders, besides several Vessels, which could take their Station on each Quarter; and not a gun of ours could be brought to bear
on them, certainly would have cut us all to pieces. Had we been able
in our situation to have injured our Enemy in the least, never would
I have surrendered while such means was in my power; but alas! fortune deprived me of a chance of convincing my Country the Veneration
I have for their Flag.
I wrote ou on the 15t"forming
that myself and Officers was confined one ay to the loathsome prison of our Crew, without any thing
to eat, on account of letters said to come from the Tripolitan pnsioners
a t Gibralter, mentioning that they were cruelly treated; by the Ministers interference for us to the Bashaw, we were permitted in the
Evening to return to our quarters, where we are still confined. The
crew are employed a t their respective trades; - the Officers have not
yet been made to work, - myself never will; - my life is in their
power, but my Soul is above their command.
The Seamen are much in want of cloathing; what measure am I to
pursue to cloath them. There is some infamous characters among
them who even rob the last Jacket from their ship mates, to sell for
liquor to get drunk on. I believe there never was so depraved a set
of mortals as Sailors are; under discipline they are peaceable & serviceable; - divest them of that, and they constitu[t]e a perfect rable.
A Sweecl who we had on board (cockswain of my Barge) a most infamous character (his conduct I mentioned to you in my last letter)
by his rascality. I think that it is probable he will be permitted to
leave this; if he should and any of our Vessels of War meets him, I
hope they will apprehend him as a deserter, to answer several capital
charges which I shall bring against him.
If Government negotiates a ransom or peace, they would find advantage by having a mediator; F. & E. are the nations most dreaded.
VFhile we have Commerce in this Sea, a Treaty with the Ottoman
Forte will be found useful.
We trust that my Country [will'Tsoon'relieve [us !from !this land of
Bondage, and hope they will reflect that serving our Country, doing
our duty as Officers has placed us here.

percieve that she struck on rocks (not laid down in any Chart) between

and was bearing off shore, going between 7 & 8 knots, when very

about 12 oClock, when 9 Gun-boats were sent from the Harbour to
attack us. All that seamanship could dictate was acted upon to
relieve us from the rocks, but proved in Vain! The Guns were hove
over-board, except a few to defend us against the Boats, - the anchors
cut from the bows - the water started in the hold - the Foremast
cut away, and the Main Top Gall$ Mast lost; and the ship creen'd
in such a manner as to make the few Guns reserved become entirely
useless: all possible hopes being fled of getting the Frigate off, and
having withstood the fire of the Gun-boats for upwards of four hours
without any power of resistance. In such a situation a Council of
Officers were called, who were unanimous of Opinion that the ship
could not be got off, and to continue in our exposed situation would
only rove a sacrifice of lives without injuring the Enemy or serving
our 8ountry, for our fate must inevitably be to fall in the hands of
the Tripolitans; - In such a dilemma, the most painful of my life,
was the Flag of the United States under my command struck, which
event has left an impression on my feelings that time will not be able
to erase, altho' I feel conscious of the rectitude of my own conduct
and of those I had the honor to command; but the ever distressing
reflection of being obliged to surrender without a chance of resistance
will be a perpetual sting. The report of their having ca.rried us by
boarding is incorrect, would to God the attempt had been made, we
should then have had a chance of convincing our Country that an
opportunity and not courage was wanting, and we should have considered i t glorious to have resisted as long as we could have destroyed
her enemies; but unfortunate for us they gave no such a chance,
and possessed too much prudence to try that mode of conquest, but
by t,aking their stations in their Gun-boats in such situations that
we could not bring a Gun to bear on them, pursued a more effectual
plan, and without any danger whatever to themselves; in fact a just
comparison of our situation, is one man. tied to a stake attacked by
another with arms. - believe me that it cannot be fully concieved
but by those who may sadly experience. We had none slain on board,
owing to their directing their shot altogether a t the masts; had they
pointed a t the Hull the slaughter must have been great, for with their
heavy metal they could chose any distance out of musket reach.
About 40 hours after we struck, a gale from the westward raised
the waters on this coast and made such a sea as floated the ship off;
we were not Gods to forsee the wind and sea, and if we had, our fate
must have been the same, for in far less time she would have been cut
to pieces; and verily believe that nothing less than the assistance of
the Elements could have got her off. Before I surrendered, had the
magazine drowned, and many articles of value destroyed: we were
taken possession of about 6 oClock, and in the course of the night was
brought on shore, robbed of all articles except the cloaths on our backs,
and a part of them were taken - for further particulars I refer you

I have not yet received a line from Commodore Preble and am a t a

attention to our situation as an Officer of the United States I return
you thanks, and as a friend accept of my prayers for your happiness.

[31 October 18031
To Susan Bainbridge, Perth Amboy, N. J., from Captain William Bainbridge,

U. S. Navy

TRIPOLI,
November Ist, 1805.
MY DEARSUSAN,
With feelings of distress which I cannot describe,
I have to inform you, that I have lost the beautiful frigate which was
placed under my command, by running her a-foul of rocks, a few miles
to the east of this harbour, which are not marked in the charts. After
defending her as long as a ray of hope remained, I was obliged to
surrender, and am now with my officers and crew confined in a prison
in this place. I enclose to you a copy of my official letter to the
secretary of the navy, from which you will learn all the circumstances
in detail, connected with our capture.
My anxiety and affliction does not arise from my confinement and
deprivations in prison - these, indeed, I could bear if ten times more
severe; but is caused by my absence, which may be a protracted one,
from my dearly beloved Susan; and an apprehension which constantly
haunts me, that I may be censured by my countrymen. These
impressions, which are seldom absent from my mind, act as a corroding canker at my heart. So maddened am I sometimes by the
workings of my imagination, that I cannot refrain from exclaiming
that it would have been a merciful dispensation of Providence if my
head had been shot off by the enemy, while our vessel lay rolling on
the rocks.
You now see, my beloved wife, the cause of my distress - my
situation in prison is entirely supportable
I have found here kind
and generous friends, such as I hope the virtuous will meet in all
situations; but if my professional character be blotched - if an
attempt be made to taint my honour - if I am censured, if it does not
kill me, it would a t least deprive me of the power of looking any of my
race in the face, always excepting, however, my young, kind, and
sympathizing wife. If the world desert me, I am sure to find a
welcome in her arms - in her affection, to receive the support and
condolence which none others can give.

-

-

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS

I cannot tell why I am so oppressed with apprehension - I am sure
I acted accordi to my best judgment - my officers tell me, that my
conduct was fau tless - that no one indeed could have done better,
but this I attribute, (perhaps in my weakness) to a generous wish on

f

their part to sustain me in my affliction.
I hope soon to hear that your health is good, and although grieved
at my misfortune, are yet surrounded by dear and condoling friends,
who will in some measure assuage your affliction. Perhaps, too, you
will be able to tell me, that I have done injustice to my countrymen that so far from censuring, they sympathize, and some even applaud
me. God grant that this may be the case - and why should it not?
The Americans are generous as they are brave. I must stop, my
dear wife, for I see I am disclosing my weakness - these are the mere
reveries which daily pass through my heated brain.
I beg that you will not suppose our imprisonment is attended with
suffering- on the contrary, it is, as I have already assured you, quite
a supportable state.
Your ever faithful and
Affec tionate husband,
WILLIAM
BAINBRIDGE.

Services rendered to the United States by Nicholas C. Nissen, Danish Consul,
Tripoli

Mr. Clark, from the committee to whom was referred a letter from
the Secretary of the E a r y , communicating the nature and extent
of the services rendered to the captive crew of the late frigate
Philadelphia, by his Danish Majestf~ consul at Tripoli, submitted the following report:
That, at the time of the unfortunate loss of the late frigate Philadelphia, off Tripoli, commanded by Captain William Bainbridge,
Nicholas C. Nissen, Esq. was his Danish hlsjesty's consul residing at
that place. As soon as this disastrous event was known to him, he
generously offered his services to obtain the necessary supplies for
Captain Rainbridge, his officers, and crew, which he most faithfully
continued to do for nineteen months and three days, the period of
their captivity. This interposition was not only humane, but greatly
beneficial to the captives, in supplying them with the necessaries and
comforts of life, which, in some instances, were beyond their limited
resources, except through this friendly agency. Consul Nissen took a
prompt and feeling interest in the welfare of the American captives,
and administered to their wants, by sending to them provisions and
bedding from his own house, and ameliorating, as much as possible,
their truly unpleasant situation; and his benevolence never suffered
the least abatement during their continuance at Tripoli.
One trait in the conduct of this worthy gentleman, is too remarksble
to be passed over without notice: His house was much exposed in the
attack Commodore Prehle made on the town of Tripoli; but such was
his zed for the accommodntion of the American prisoners, and his
anxiety to be near them, that he refuesed to seek a place of security,

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS

183

although urged so to do ;and by remaining at home, greatly endangered
his life. From the most correct information of Consul Nissen's disinterested conduct, the committee are of opinion that he deserves well
of the American Government, and, therefore, recommend the following
resolution:
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
America i n Congress assembled,
That the President of the United States be requested to cause to be made
known to R'icolas C. Nissen, Esq. his Danish Majesty's consul residing at
Tripoli, the high sense entertained by Congress of his disinterested and
benevolent att.entions manifested to Cspt.ain Bainbridge, his officers, and
crew, during the time c ~ their

captivity in Tripoli.

Bainbridge ate commander of the U. States frigate Philadelphia for
the loss of said frigate, and that you report to me in proper form the
whole extent of the enquiry of said court, with its decided opinion
thereon, in order that I may transmit the same to the Navy Department of the U. States.

Commanding the U S. frigate President.

T

In conformity to the foregoing order the court convened on board
the U States frigate President, at anchor in the harbor of Syracuse, at
ten oclock a. m. June 2gth 1805. present the President and members of
the Court and William Eaton Esq. acting Judge Advocate, and being
opened according to law Captain Bainbridge was notified that they
were ready to proceed to business; he attended and the Court entered
upon the enquiry by examination of witnesses
Lieut. David Porter, of the late frigate Philad"
Lieu! Jacob Jones,
Lieut. Theohre Hunt, Lieu+Benjamin Smith - Mr William Enight,
sailing master, Lieu! William Osborn of the marine corps, M' Keith
Spence, pmser - Daniel T. Patterson Benjamin IF. Read and James
Gibbons masters mates - Midshipmen James Biddle James Renshaw
& [space] Anderson - Richard Stephenson, gunner - George Hodge,
boatswain & William Godby, carpenter, all of the said frigate were
sworn and improved as witnesses LIEU! DAVIDPORTER
testified, that on the 31t of October 1803
about eight o'clock in the morning, the ship Philadelphia, then under
the command Captain William Bainbridge and cruising off the port
of Tripoli, the wind from the eastward, and the frigate standing in
and along shore, discovered a sail on her weather bow, running to the
westward, to which she gave chase. The sail was soon distinguished
to be an enemy corsaire standing into the port of Tripoli. The
Philadelphia continued the chase until she came into about eight
fathom water keeping up a constant fire on the enemy with her bow
guns, until it was found impossible to come up with her without
danger of approaching too near the shore; consequently she hawled
out to gain an offing - She had constantly three leads going, one
dipsey and two hand leads; a lieutenant tending the dipse and a
mldshipmm or master's mate a t each of the hand leads. 8he ship

190

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1803 TO 180.4

had about eight nots way upon her. This witness was ordered into
the mizen top to look into the harbour of Tripoli and observe if any
cruisers were in port. At this instant the water shoaled and the healm
was put dowc. He had gotten about half way up the mizen rigging
when he felt the ship strike He immediately returned on deck - All
sails were instantly set to endeavour to force her over the bank. Finding this did not succeed, Captain Bainbridge asked the witnesse's opinion what could best be done? Who requested him to consult his
officers generally - The lead had been hove under her bows in about
twelve feet water. The ship lifted a t times abaft and the healm was
then clear. The enemy's gun boats were already seen coming out of
port, nine in number, as nearly as the witness recollects - A boat
was sent out to sound around the ship and deep water was found a
stern. The officers, being consulted, were of opinion that endeavors
should be used to back the ship off by a press of sail; and, if that should
not succede, to run the guns abaft: both were done, and at the same
time the anchors cut from the bows: but to no effect. I t was then the
opinion that the guns should be hove overboard, reserving only
enough to resist the gun boats: this was done. In the meantime the
enemy passed under the fire of the frigates stern guns and took a
osition on the starboard and weather quarter where no guns could be
%rought to bear on them by reason of their advantageous position
and the deep heel to port and fixed posture of the ship - Captain
Bainbridge now called another counsel of the officers, who were of
Opinion that the water should be started in the hold and pumped out,
and all the heavy articles hove overboard; if that should not succede,
that, as a last resort to save the ship, the foremast should be cut away:
all these were done to no effect - Orders were then given to the carpenter to go down forward and bore holes through the ships bottom;
and to the gunner to drown the magazine by turning the cock and
securing the key: the witness heard the gunner report that he had
executed this order. Orders were then given to destroy every thing
on board which could be rendered useful to the enemy. I t had now
already been determined that the flag must be struck, as no hopes
remained of saving the ship and no possible means of defending her.
The Colours were accordingly struck, and the enemy took possession.
I t was now about sun down, and the ship had grounded about half after
eleven in the morning, as nearly as the witness can recollect, during
which time she was exposed to the constant fire of the gun boats, but
suffered only in her spars and rigging - The ship was lost about
three miles and a half from the town of Tripoli, and one and a half
from the nearest point of land, which bore south.
QUESTION^ BY THE COURT.
Had you any boats sufficient to carry out an anchor?
Ans. I t is my opinion we had not: but had this been otherwise the
enemy commanded the ground where it would have been necessary
to drop anchors.
What water did the ship draw when she went on shore?
As nearly as I can recollect she drew about eighteen feet forward
and nineteen and a half abaft.
QUESTION
BY THE JUDGE
ADVOCATE.
During the transactions and disaster of that day did ou notice
any thing of remissness or neglect in her commander w ch could
tend to the loss of the Philadelphia?

Ans. I did not: On the contrary, I noticed in Capfain Bainbridge
great coolness and deliberation.
LIEU$JACOB

was called into court and examined. He
confirmed in every thing the testimony of Lieu1 Porter, without
variation LIEU$THEODORE
HUNTKas examined before the court - and
varied only in his testimony from the two preceding witnesses in the
draft of the Philadelphia's water when she went aground, which he
stated to have been ei hteen feet six inches forward and about twenty
feet six inches aft, m ich he had ascertained from observation the
day before t,he misfortune - And also, in answer to the first question
by the court t o Lieu* Porter, he adds that in the river Delaware he
made an experiment in carrying out an anchor in the Philadelphia's
launch, when she was obliged to be buoyed by casks LIEU; BENJAMIN
SMITH,corroborates the testimony of the preceding witnesses without adding any material circumstance M: Wm KNIGHT,sailing master, was examined He c o n h s the
testimony of the witnesses before recorded - And adds that he was
positive the ship was pierced forward by the carpenter as ordered,
for he heard the water running into the Auger wholes - When
asked why the ship did not fill, he said he expected she would have
filled, as he was sure there were suflicient wholes bored for the purpose; but he conjectured they must have been stopped in some manner.
Mc KILLIAM

the testimony of the preceding witnesses RiIr KEITH SPENCE,purser, varies in nothing material from the
witnesses gone before him.
BENJAMIN

Lieu$ Porters testimony, and adds that, in order by every means to
render the Ship useless after it was determined to strike her colours,
cannon shot were thrown into the pumps.

REHARDSTEPHENBON,
the transactions on the Philadelphia's deck the day she was lost,
being confined to the magazine until he received an order to tufn the
cock and drown the magazine; which he did and went on deck with
the keys in his hand - The ship was then on her beam ends, the
water running in a t the ports, and such of her guns as were not thrown
overboard, rendered totally useless GEORGE
HODGE,
boatswain, states facts, so far as they come within
his knowledge, in exact conformity to the testimony of Lieu5 Porter;
but adds nothing.
WILLIAM
GODBY,carpenter, was examined concerning the scuttling
of the ship - He testifies that, when it was determined to abandon
the PhiZadelphia, he received Captain Bainbridge's orders to scuttle

her, which he executed by calling to his assistance his two mates and
iercing her bottom with chizels and augers in sufficient
Ee thouoht to fill her, and then reported to the proper o&%bu&;
the TU&, he believes, got on board in season to stop the holes and
prevent her filling Mr WILLIAMKNIGHTwas called in and asked by the court if ever
he had a chart in his possession which laid down a shoal where the
Philadelphia grounded? Mr Knight answered - No!
Mr PATERSON,
a midshipman, was called into court, and being
sworn, testified that he destroyed the mumerary si nal book of the
Philadelphia by Captain Bainbridges orders before Teaving her Mr ANDERSON
was examined concerning the disposition made of
the Philadelphia's signal books, who declared that he saw Captain
Bainbridge tear them both up and hand them to some officer to be
burned or thrown overboard At the opening of the court Captain Bainbridge laid before them
the following statement ('GENTLEMEN,
Having to account to Government for the loss of
the United States frigate Philadelphia, then under my command, it
is a consolatory circumstance to see that it is before an inquisition,
which, by its nautical knowledge, will be so fully adequate to form a
correct opinion of the affair and to give that decision on my conduct
which both the public and myself must be assured will be just.
In my narrative of this unhappy event, I shall mention my sending
the United States schooner to cruise off cape Bon, and the causes
that lead tlo that circumstance, which increased the misfortune that
afterwards befel us, and then detail the incidents that took place on
the day of our grounding, from the time of giving chase in the morning
till surrendering to the enemy We left Malta the 34 of October, to repair to our station off Tripoli,
and to blockade that port according to the orders of Commodore
Preble. We arrived there on the 7'Q and continued to cruize off the
town, with the Vixen in company, without meeting any occurrence
of consequence till the 19@ when we spoke an imperial brig, as she
came out of the harbor of Tripoli, which informed us that two of the
cruisers of that regency were out upon a cruise. In consequence of
this information, and thinking it most probable that they were to
the westward I ordered Lieu! Commandant Smith of the Vixen, to
Cape Bon, and cruize there as the most likely place of falling in with
them should they be returning from that quarter, and a t the same
time a safer situation for the schooner than off Tripoli at that season
of the year, where the gales blow with great violence on shore, attended
with a heavy sea. On the 20'4 the Vizen accordingly left us. The
234 of the month we had a very heavy gale from the northward and
westward, which drove us several leagues to the eastward of our
station. On the 31%of October, being about six lea ues to the eastward of Tripoli, at 9. a. m. we saw a sail in shore an standing to the
westward; we ave chase, and a t 11 oclock came near enough for our
shot to reach er; and the soundings not allowing of our running in
shore we continued to chase along the land, hauling on and off shore
as we found the soundings from 7 to 9 & 10 fathoms, in expectation
of either disabling or driving her on shore, in which case we should

%

hare captured or destroyed her - At half past 11 when within a
league and a half from Tripoli, seing no probabilit of preventing
the chase from getting into port, we ceased firing and auled off shore,
then having eight fathoms water. We had not gone more than two
cables length before we suddenly shoaled, and the next moment the
ship struck forward, and having 8% nots way, shot up as far on the
rock as to bring it to the after part of the fore chains where she stopped.
Her stern being at this tune clear of the ground, the anchors were cut
immediately from the bows (except one) the guns run aft, and alI the
sails laid aback, in hopes of pressing her off, as it blew a strong breeze;
but the wind being on our starboard beam, and the sea setting with
i t directly upon the rocks, soon hove our stern upon them in 17 feet
water, where we lay with our larboard port sills at the waters edge.
The ofher who had been sent to sound upon our first grounding,
returned with information that there was s a c i e n t water astern and
off the larboard quarter, upon which I consulted my officers respecting
the most probable means of getting the ship into it. I t was the unanimous opinion that the only method in our power was to lighten the
ship as much as possible b starting the water, heaving overboard the
puns, resen-ing as many on y as would be necessary to defend us against
the enemy's gun boats which were taking their station on our stern
and quarter, and to endeavour to press her off the shoals with the sails
aback. We could not in addition to this avail ourselves of an anchor,
as we had no boat capable of carrying one; and if we had had such
sufficient for the purpose, it would ha\-e been impracticable to have
have laid it out, as the enemy occupied almost the ground it should
have been placed in The gun boats having taken a station on our Starboard quarter,
commenced a firing, directed principally at our masts and rigging,
which we returned with two guns from our main deck and three of
our quarter deck cannonades, which, from the very great heel the
ship had, took no effect. The guns we got out abaft were rendered
intirely useless from the same cause, although we cut away the stern
as much as could be done to any purpose; for by endeavouring to give
them a direction to bear upon the enemy, they could not be run out
far enough to avoid setting fire to the ship, which they once did, but
it was soon extinguished without difficulty or confusion. After finding it impossible to press the ship off the rocks by lightning her, and
seeing every prospect of getting her afloat at an end, I ordered the
foremast to be cut away, in order to right her in some deqree, if
possible, and to render our guns more manageable; but this produced
no effect, and seeing the ship immoreably grounded on rocks, having
but 12 feet water forward and 17 abaft, I concieved any further
attempts as eridently useless.
After h a ~ i n gtried every expedient that couid be thought of to
contribute to our relief, and exerting ourselves to the utmost from
the time of our grounding until half past four p. m. in tndeavoring
to get the ship afloat and a t the same time in resisting the enemy,
but finding all hopes of the first vain, and not being able to bring
our guns to bear to effect the latter, I called a council of officers to
consult them on the subject of a further resistance or the necessity
of surrendering to the enemy. Upon a deliberate consideration of
our situation, it was the unanimous opinion that i t was impossible to
get the ship off, and that all further resistance would be but unneces-

sarily exposing men in a situation where neither perseverance nor
fortitude would be of any benefit to our Country or ourselves; ctnd
i t was unanimously agreed that the only thing left for us to do was to
surrender to the enemy, which was accordingly done, after drowning
the m a g a h e , and destroying as many articles as possible, that might
be of use to the enemy Having stated to you, Gentlemen, a narrative of facts, which you
will find rerifyed by the evidence to be heard I shall conclude after
making one observation.
The usage of nations appears, that where there is no probability
of successful defence, and all means of escape have been tried, the
Jlag may be struck without injuring the commander's honor - These
tacit but admitted regulations are founded on principles of humanity,
and a nice and delicate attention to national and individual honor.
If under such circumstances a commander's honor be preserved,
how free from censure must it appear when placed in a situation
n-ithout being able in the least to injure the enemy, and no means
whatever of extricating himself -

PTm BAINBRIDGE

29 June 1806. -

The Court h a m g deliberated on the evidence deduced from the
testimony of the witnesses, heard m this case, are decidedly of opinion,
that Captain William Bainbridge acted with fortitude and conduct
in the loss of his ship, the U States frigate Philadelphia on the 31 a!
Oct. 1803, and that no degree of censure should attach itself to him

SIR. The President's cownission for the private armed Ship
Warren, has been delivered us by the Navy agent of this City according to your directions, on giving the requisite Bond and Security. I n
consequence of the rumors and their subsequent confirmation, of the
hostile disposition of the Emperor of Morocco, which have transpired
since our application for the above commission, we have been induced
to enlarge the armament of the Ship R'arren to the number of Sixteen

alterations made therein conformable to the armament as above

DEPARTMENT

Novr dtQ1803.
SIR. Since my last (of the 31" ult.) I have r e d from Mr Gavino,
a copy of Cap! Bainbridge's letter to you, of the 2gtQof August last,
in which he relates the capture of the Imperial Cruiser Mesboha
[Mirboka],and the recapture of her American prize the Celia of Boston.
Notwithstanding the perfidy with which hostilities have been thus
commenced by the Emperor, as it is important that the dispatches
intended to be landed at LIOrient should be immediately forwarded,
and as the gun-carriages are already prepared, the Schooner Citizen
will proceed to Gibraltar with her Cargo: and if the turn which our
affairs with Morocco, has assumed permits their being presented as
first intended, without too much condescention on our part, and it
will contribute to any object commensurate with their value, you will
not withhold them. Should they not be wanted for such a purpose,
you will be pleased to inform Tobias Lear Esqr our Consul General at
Algiers of it. But if they can be safely and conveniently stored, it will
be best not hastily to decide u on their not being wanted for the
Emperor, but if they should not e immediately given, to wait a suitable time in order to observe the course our affairs may take in relation
to him.
The President will probably this day, communicate to Congress the
information received respecting the aggression above alluded to, and
they will doubtless make provision for meeting the exegency in a manner suited to its nature. As soon as the result is known I shall com-

E

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS
municate it [to] you with such instructions as may grow out of the
measures they may think proper to adopt.
Novr loth.The Citizen having been detained by objections made
by her crew founded on their apprehensions of danger from the
Emperor's Cruizers, your letter of the 5 t h Septc has come to hand in
the interval. The President has as above intimated, communicated
Cap1 Bainbridge's letter to Congress, who have not yet come to any
determination respecting the measures proper to be taken. They will
doubtless be only recautionmy, and if in the mean time, the Emperor
of Morocco is w&ng to disavow the hostile acts which have taken
place, and to consider the peace as continued, notwithstanding what
has happened, the President is willing that his ships & subjects should
be restored, provided the accommodation shall not appear to you to
to be a feint calculated merely to obtain them with a view to further
acts of perfideous hostility. The Emperor should also cause some
satisfaction to be given for the insult offered to your official character
by the detention of your person at the house of the Governor of
Tangier. If therefore an arrangement can be brought into train, on
the principles above indicated, you will connect with it a demand for
such satisfaction in the form suggested, by a prudent regard to the
honor of the United States. Commodore Preble is ordered to deliver
up the ships & their equipages on your signifying to him that your
negotiations require it.

hT0zvr 6th1803

Dr SIR I n the multiplicity of momentous circumstances that a t
present must employ your mind, it may possibly be deem'd intrusive,
to call your attention to further discussion, but by late intelligence
from the Mediterranean, respecting the unpleasant state of our Commerce, I am induced to give you my Ideas on that head, being well
acquainted with the disposition, & locality of hlorocco, & be assured
that none of the powers on the coast of Barbary can annoy us equal
to that.
They wanted but a slight pretence to commence their depredations,
& that pretence hath been but too fully justified by the delay in sending on the gun carriages, promised long since; with some other irritating circumstances, clashing with the policy of that nation, & I am
much mistaken if we have not to pay dear for it, but to obviate the
evil as far as existing circumstsnces will a d u ~ i &
t the resources of our
Country can justify it certainly will be expedient to reinforce our
Squadron in those Sens, in which no time ought to be lost, as our ships
cant be got down the Potowmac in the TTinter, & 'tis more than
probable that we shall have to wage war with all the states of Barbary
ere long, but with respect to Morocco, the ships destined to repel
their aggressions, should be station'! principally along the Atlantic
sbores, from Cape Finistere to cape Cantin as most of their naval
ports are on the Atlantic, such as Tangier, which is a t the cntrance
of the Streights, and coud see any Vessel that goes in, & out, there are
also Sallee, Magadore, Rabat, Arzille & several others, contiguous &
if our ships once enter the streights & the Westerly winds should set
in which often prevail there for several weeks in the fall, and Winter,
they cannot get out through the rapidity of the current setting up,
till an Easterly wind prevails, as was the case with me last Wmter,
when I was detained six weeks a t Gibralter; so that those Pirates may
cruize without, unmolested I may be deemed presuming, or an interested adviser, but I declare
my real sentiments, and am under a firm conviction that nothing
but coercive Measures can controul those Pirstical States & they
will commit hostilities against us whenever the whim takes, & the
more we pay the more are they emboldened, and i t would be less

degrading, $ more honorable, never to pay them a Cent but give
tribute from the mouth of our Cannon
I find we stand much in need of some powerfull friend in Congress to
save us and our families from a state of ruin, 'tho we ere to bear the brunt
upon all these commotions; i% fain would ask your patronage in behalf
of myself & our Officers generally, to put us upon a better establishment 1 have, & I beleive many others have, also, spent the greater
part of their substance in the public service our commands are respectable & must be supported with expence, & being ever liable to be
called into service precludes us from turning our attention to other
pursuits, being so few in number, & 'tis hard to be confined to half
pay for those intervals, when out of service, a t least our one helf
rations ought to be annex'd to half pay - this with some other
reforms I hope you will find meet to assist us in, when other more
weighty concerns have been decided
1 beg you will present my respects to M' & Mr9 Gallatin & accept
of my assurances of esteem & with great regard

for this service; relying with the greatest confidence on your Zeal for
the Honor and Interest of your Country Experience has taught us that, implicit faith cannot be placed in
Treaties with any of the Barbary States; you will, therefore, as often
as possible, appear on the coast of Morocco; and communicate with
Consul Simpson at Tanger. If you learn that any of their cruisers
are fitting for sea; you will inform yourself of the object of such equipment; and take care that, you repel the first aggression on their part,
with the greatest promptitude; as an ascendency can only be obtained
over these, or any other Barbarians, but by a determined mode of
conduct towards them.
When any considerable number of American Vessels are collected
here, for the purpose of procuring Convoy to the Eastward, you will
proceed with them as far as Cape Martin, or farther, if in your opinion absolutely necessary. Keep a good look out about Cape De Gatt,
and cruise there occasionally.
You are to Capture all Vessels belonging to the Bashaw of Tripoli,
or his Subjects; and to annoy the Enemy by all the means in your
power. You are to respect the rights of Nations with whom we are
a t peace, and not to capture Vessels within the jurisdictional limits,
or under the protection of such Nations. You are at all times (as
far as may be in your power) to succour, aid, relieve &free,m y American Vessel attacked by the Enemy, or in their possession
As it is impossible for me to anticipate every situation in which
you may possibly be placed; & owing to the distance I am from you,
and the difficulty of communication, much must depend on your own
judgment and prudence; you will however keep me advised of all
your proceedings by every opportunity, and write frequently to the
Navy Dep. In case of any event of an important or alarming nature, you will send me notice, by hiring a small swift Sailing Vessel,
with an Officer in charge of the Dispatches, if you cannot consistently
leave this Station in the Argus.
You will rendezvous occnsionall in this Bay, a t Csdiz, and hlalaga;
and frequently visit the Bay of %anger. I expect one of the small
Frigates from the United Ststes on this station early in the Spring
to watch the motions of the Morocco Cruisers. When she arrives,
you will immediately take such dispatches as she may have for me,
and join the squadron in the Blockade of Tripoli.
The Officers of the Argus may receive payments of money from
time to time, but no advance beyond what may be due them; for
which, and other necessary expences, you may immediately make a
requisition on me, for Three thousand Dollars, to prevent the necessity of your drawing Bills, which cannot be done without great loss
to Government. You will make all your requisitions for Provisions
on John Gavino Esqr ConsuI at Gibraltar; and be will supply you
with sucb as belong to the U: S - Such articles as he has not, you
must purchase, but in all cases of expenditure you n-ill make use of
the greatest economy.
In case a provision ship should arrive, you d consult Mr Gavino,
and exercise your best judgment respecting the safest, and most

SIR On Signal from the Constibution, ou will get under weigh,
and proceed in company with her to the B ockade of Tripoli. But if
it so happen, that we should part company you will make the best of
your way & join the Frigate Philadelphia and Schooner Vixen off that
place; and continue to cruise ther until1 the season makes i t dangerous;
and then you must harbour in Syracuse. But you must even in the
worst season go out and shew yourself off Tripoli occasionally if only
a day or two at a time, as it will have a good effect by convincing
those Barbarians, that their vessels are not safe in leaving port at
any season of the year.
You are to capture all vessels belonging to the Bashaw of Tripoli
or his subjects and to annoy the Enemy by all the means in your power.
You are not to suffer the vessels of any Nation to enter or to have
commerce with Tripoli, but if any Vessel bound in who might not
have been informed of the Blockade, it would be well to order her off,
and if detected in making a second attempt, you will send such vessel into Syracuse for adjudication
You will respect the rights of nations with whom we are at peace,
and not capture vessels within the jurisdictional limits, or under the
protection of such Nations. You are at all times (so far as may be
in your power) to succour, aid, relieve and free, any American Vessel
attacked by the Enemy or in their possession.
The Officers of the Nautilus, may receive payments of money from
time to time; but no advance beyond what may be due them; for
which and other necessary purposes, you may immediately make a
requisition on me for Two thousand Dollars to prevent the necessity
of your drawing Rills, which cannot be done without great loss to
Government.
In all instances of expencc observe the strictest economy, and keep
me regularly informed from time to time of all your proceedings[LC. EPP, Order Book, May 1803-June 1805.1

protection of our commerce and Seamen in that quarter. It is a

SIRI arrived here from Cadiz the 6 t h Ins' On my way I stoped at

Tanger Bay and sent a boat on shore. Everything is quiet in that
quarter. The Emperor has complied strictly with his promise as far
as he has had opportunity. The Captain of the Mishouda has been
severely punished; and the moment the NazLtilus arrived at Mogadore
with the Emperor's orders, the American Brig Hannah, which had
been detained there, was released and the Craw set a t liberty. The
weather has been so stormy since I came into this Bay that i f .has
not been possible for Col. Lear with his family to embark I hope
they will be able to come on board to day - The Argw is arrived
and is without exception the handsomest vessel of her rate that I
have ever seen. She is very much and very justly admired by every
Officer: - The order she is in does great credit to her commander Lt Decatur has delivered me the 30,000 Dollars mentioned in your
letter of the 22nd of August which I now have the honor t.o acknowledge the receipt of and shall attend to its contents - L' Hull has
exchanged commands with L? Decatur The Nautilus & Enterprize
are both here. The Store Ship from BaltQ has arrived - I t is
necessary the provisions should go to Syracuse as soon as possible;
and as no vessels can be obtained to carry them there, except we
trust them in the Vessels of Nations at War I have advised Mr Gavino
to bargain with the master of the Traveller to carry the cargo up,
which be has done, and is to pay 3000 Dollars. This is 800 Dollars
more than the customary freight in English Vessels, if they could be
had, but they cannot, and the expence of landing and storing the
Cargo and re-shipping it, and the damage and loss the provision
would sustain in such removals would make more than three times
that difference in the expence and as English Vessels would be liable
to capture by the French Privateers of whch there are a great number
out we might be disappointed in our supplies. I have advised Mr
Gavino to give him that Sum, as he found the Captain determined
not to take less. The best way in future will be to freight the Store
Ships for Syracuse, to stop a t Gibraltar for orders I regret that She
has not brought out any Cheese, Butter, Molasses, or Candles, as
those articles are extremely dear here. The Enterprize goes direct to
Syracuse to convoy the Provision Ship - The Argus with a convoy
to Mersaillcs and back to this Station; and the Nautilus accompanies
me to Algiers, and from thence off Tripoli. I enclose copies of all
their orders for your perusal. I shall only remain off Tripoli myself

a t present a day or two, as I must go to Syracuse to make the Necessary establishments and arrangements there, but shall not remain
long in port - You may rest confidently assured, there shall not
be an idle Vessel m my Squadron, I shall sail the moment the wind
and weather will allow me to The Store Ship had 2 Men im ressed and taken out of Cadiz by
the British Frigate Meidstone, (!!?aptn Elliot The British make a
practice of taking from our Merchant Vessels every man that has
not a Protection, and very often those who have- What would be
said if our Ships of War were to take by force even Americans out of
English Mercht Ships? it would make a bustle in America as well
as England! and why have we not as good a right even to impress
from their Ships English Men when destitute of Protections, as they
have Americans from Ours? They certainly have no more right to
presume every man without a protection on board our Merchant
Ships to be English than we have to consider every Englishman in
the same situation on board their Vessels an American - However,
this is a matter for the Government - I shall take care that they
do not go so far as to take mine by force with impunity The Argus
is so fine a Vessel, and so well calculated and armed for the service
I shall want her for before Tripoli, that you will pardon me for again
urging the necessity of sending out a 32 Gun Frigate for this Station
to take her place that I may have her Services. I am still of opinion
that a Schooner or Brig with the Frigate, will be necessa to watch
the Straits of Gibraltar and the Coast of Morocco, a n 7 to afford
Convoy to our Mercht Vessels bound up the Mediterranean.
If a quantity of good Slop Clothing could be sent to Syracuse in
the first Store Ship that comes out, it would be of advantage to the
Service, a quantity of Canvass and Twine will be wanted and cannot
be purchased here, without paying a most enormous price for it Lt Dent is an officer of uncommon Merit Active, Steady, Intilligen t,
and ever attentive to his duty. I find great relief since he joined the
Ship, and hope his exertions on all occasions to promote the good of
the Service will entitle him to the notice of the President e're long,
and gain him the promotion of Lieutenant Commandant But at the
same time I hope I shall not be deprived of his services in this Ship
while I command her The Officers generally have conducted well.
I am sorry however to inform you that Lt Livingston of the Argus did
while in Boston conduct very improperly, and in a manner disgraceful
to himself as an Officer; and that there is not any probability of his
amendment - He is extremely intemperate and exposes himself to
observations on board and on Shore. I have forbid Lt Hull from
suffering him to go on shore to disgrace the Service; and the first
formal complaint that is made against him, I shall arrest and order
him home- this will be a painful task to me, but the Service requires it.
I have on board the Constitution many remarkable h e young
men whose conduct promises great things to their Country I t is necessary that as many Mediterranean passes be sent out as
there are Vessels in the Squadron that each one may have a check on
any Barbary Cruiser should they have false Tops - which it has
been hinted to me they can procure [LC. EPP, LB, Mag-Dec. 1803.1

Dr SIR I am happy to find that you have taken your station in
Congress, Battering myself in the hope of an acquisition of one more
friend in Congress, to keep up the spirit of our P t ' a t ~ and
,
to put us
upon a more permanent footing than we are at present. I have written to my friend Mr Nicholson on this subject, & can
assure you that thew are but few- of the Officers, belonging to Nary,
who have families that have not nearly ruined them in the service,
for how is it possible that we can rnemtain ourselves, when out of
commission, upon our half pay, not bang even allowed half Rations?
'tis well known, that to keep up s decent ship, and to carry with us
that respect which our Rank, & stations require, every Cant of our

212

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1803 TO 1804

pay is only sufficient t o meet our expences on ship-board; and when
we considcsr that being ever liable to be called into service, it is impossible to turn our attention to other objects, for a livelyhood in the
intervals. As the cheif revenue of the U. States arrives from its commerce,
which must have at least an apparent protection, surely our Countrymen cannot be so ungenerous as to suffer her O5cers to be ruined, or
very much embarrassed, especially as there are so few of us, but I
fear that the object of keeping up that rigid Economy absorbs every
other consideration. It is often found expedient to appropriate a little money to save a
good deal, & the eyes of Europe are now upon us, watcliing our deportment towards the states of Barbary, & badly as our arrangements have
been executed, we have spread no small degree of terror among them,
but like a Dam to impede a rushing torrent, often when least expect~d,
forces its barrier, and ruin and desolation is the consequence, so, be
assured that when ever those Barbary states find us ofl our gaurd
that they will commit serious mischief upon our Commerce, the seeds
of Discord, & Envy, are now sowed and especially with Morocco and
we ought to keep a vigilant lookout in that quarter. I feel happy in seeing your name annexed to the Committee, t o
enquire into the e-spediency of coercive measures, & when we recollect
that Tripoli, & Morocco are nearly 1500 miles apart, & those seas so
uncertain in traversing up, & down, a seperate division should be
provided in case of emergences notwithstanding it may clash with
Financial arrangements & should it be deem'd necessary I hope the
Seer of the Xavy will give me the preference to command, for altho'
high on the list of Rank I have nerer yet been honor'd with the charge
of a division, for what reason I know not, but if I have not merited
such a trust I am unconscious of my errors

to the necessity of malcing peace, if he should not be disposed to do it,
upon proper and admissible terms, before that time. Should this arrangement meet your approbation, I will be ready to
proceed t.o Tripoli whenever you will be pleased to advise me that the

In which he requests the loan of forty Thousand Spanish Dollars
with Guns Powder 8 9 he will give the United States any Security in
his Power G z by Putting American Troops in Possession of one of the
forts in Tripoli when ever it is taken until1 that sum is repaid
Should the City of Tripoli be taken by Storm he the said Bashaw
of Derna will then have Plenty of Cash &- the American Troops will
receive their Share of Prize Money,
the Bashaw of Tripole has been a t War with a great Kation
of Arabs but has come to some terms with them, but has lost many
of his Troops also with his Brother the Bashaw of Derna who has
defated him, altho in want of every thing, but finding his Brothers
Troops daily arrive from Tripoli & no assistance from America he
thought Proper to leave Derna for the Present.
Therefore the United States will consider whither i t is better to
assist this said Bashaw of Derna to be Bashaw of Tripoli or to pay the
Present Bashaw his unreasonable demand of three Million of Dollars
and then not certain of keeping Peace with him one year afterward
if the United States assist the Said Bashaw of Derna to be Bashaw
of Tripoli they are certain of being successfull and it will be the means
of keeping America a t peace with all the other Barbary States
I understand your late Consul a t Tripoli has been the cause of

War of the United States.
A Ship of 30 Guns and 150 Men,
Two gallies built last year.
Another galley was getting ready a t Tatuam in August, and the
Governor of Tangier at that date expressed his intention of arming a
two masted boat lately seized there under Genoess colours. In the
month of September last passports were issued by all the Consuls at
Morocco, except the American, for another Frigate which was to
proceed to Cadiz, Lisbon or elsewhere to be coppered and repaired.

1at4 November 1805.

DEARSIR,I received yesterday a letter from the french Ambassador
a t this Court in which he mentioned to me that some Deserters from
the french Marine had taken refuge on board the United States frigate,
the Constellation, & requests, that I would, in compliance with the
good understanding which subsists between our two Governments,
use my endeavours to have them delivered up to the french Commissary at Cadiz. - In consequence of this request I take the liberty
of recommending to you not to suffer any french Sailors to be shipped
by the Officers under your command - The present situation of
the United States with respect to their Commerce & Flag is so happy
& valuable a one, that it can never be prudent in us to risque a dispute
witb either of the belligerent Powers for the sake of obtaining a few
Stlilors - We surely have Sailors enough of our own to prevent this
necessity - In short, the state of affairs requires that we should be
very exact indeed in our conduct, & as the French have, I am told,
given u several American Sailors who had entered their serwice, I hope
you w$ enable me to say that we have done the same.
You will let me hear from you on this subject as soon as possible, &
I should be obliged to you to write by duplicate, as there is a probability that one of your Letters may miscarry, unless indeed you should
happen to be in a Spanish Port at the time you write.

SIR. I have the honor to inform you that we arrived here on the

quarantined for some days longer. Enclosed is the latest intelligence from Tripoli by which you will
be inform'd of the whole marine force of that Regency, & that several
of their Cruisers are at Derna where they will undoubtedly remain
until the Bashaw of Tripoli subdues his brother Hamet, in order to
prevent the latter from receiving supplies from Malta, this will take
up a considerable time to effect, & it occurs to me that the[y] would
fall an easy prey to any of our vessels of war that would attempt the
enterprize. - Uerna is the eastermost Yort or Bay of the Regency of
Tripoli, it is defended by a small fortification of 8 or 10 Guns the
water is not deep, but sufficiently so for our Schooners when lighten'd
for the purpose. You will likewise receive copys of two letters from me to Comv
Morris ~ h i c hwill give you my unalterable opinion relative to the
manner of negotiating with Tripoli, their is nothing formidable in
that Regency but 10 Gun boats & the Bashaws obstinacy; the first
must be destroy'd; & the last subdued by force of arms before we will
be able to effect any thing, unless overnment thinks proper to comply
with all his demands, which wil furnish the other Elegencys with
pretext to encrease their demands upon us & their will be no end to
their exactions depredations & insolcnce; we had better be at war with

the Bashaw of TripoLi's demands; all Europe as well as Barbary hadl
view'd our conduct in silent expectation, since the war with Tripoli
commenced, the former with an intention to follow our example if
worthy imitation, & the latter to know how to rank us among the
nations of the earth, whether to class us with Great Britain and
France the only nations who make themselves respected, or with the
northern nations whose miserable pusdnnimous acpnomy has so far
preponderated in their Councils as to induce them m many instances
to sacrifice their national dignity merely because it cost's them something less to bribe those Hegencys to confer the honor of permiting
them to navigate the mediterranean sea, than i t would to maintain a
Squadron in the Mediterranean: it is true t.hey have an excuse for so
doing that we have not: they say the act is by no means consider'd
as national, the Chamber of. Commerce defrasing the expences
occasioned by an intercourse wlth the Barbary States: and say they,
if the merchants finds that i t is to their advantage to pay those sums
for the enjoyment of a trade (by no means secure) in the mediterranean why should we go to a considerable expence to oppose them, when
the King pays nothing; it is different with us the money comes out of
the public treasurg and is appropriated by a public act of the legislative
body of the nation which makes i t the more dishonorable. I shall remain here until May, in the mean time if I can be of any
use either in procuring Gunboats or accomplishing any thing conducive to the good of the service, I am always ready at a moments
warning; I mention Gunboats because I am con-Finced that with two
mortars mounted on the brigs & eight or ten Gunboats that the force
under your command is sufficient to reduce Tripoli to ashes & propably
to effect a revolution in that Regency favourable to our interests in
the whole of the Barbary States, it would st least in the sentiments
of the heads of the other Regencys which would insure us more respect
in future, as we must at some period adopt energetic measures, the
sooner the better as it will be attended with less fxpence. 1 would thank you to inform me where you %dlmost propably find
any communication that I may have
my power to make you, as
M' Kissen & others communicates intelligence to me with less reserve
than they would to a stranger. If any thing worth your attention should occur before the departure

SIR, I have the honour to inform, that agreeable to Cap! Bainbridge's letter of the 1st I left Malta on the 15th with dispatches for
you, after having m[any] Calms on the 17th Gozo bearing S. S. E. 39
Miles, I e-qerienced a heavy Blow from the N. W. which compelled
me to return to Malta, speaking at the same time a Convoy from
Gibraltar to Malta, having in Company a Ship with Provision, by
which I received letters for Cap+Bainbridge & myself, mine not informing me of your situation, I conceived that the nature of the service rendered it consistant to read of those from you to Cap' Bainbridge, in order to preclude the possibility of not falling in with you
on my way to Gibraltar.
Herewith I take the liberty of enclosing my letter from Cap3 Bainbridge, with a copy of his to the Secretary of the Navy - I have left
one letter in the hands of the Consul of this place from Cap! Bainbridge for you - I shall leave this place to day on my way to Gibraltar, keeping the southern shore on board in order to meet with you which should I not effect, I shall proceed to the before mentioned place,
depositing in the hands of M: Ga.rino the letters to be forwarded by
the earliest conveyance to America, from whence I shall repair with
all possible dispatch to join the Squadron, trusting that you will view
my arrangement as consistant as my situation will admit of
P S. Coinceiving it probable that you may wish some communication with the Town of Tripoli; I have directed the Cap? of the English

SIR I haye the honor to i ~ f o r myou that I arrived and anchored
here the 19th Ins$, with the Nautilus in company; but the m6nd
shifting suddenly from S S W to N l4' and a prospect of a gale made it
prudent to get under Weigh last night and stand out to Sea - I am
now stretching into the Bay to receive a present of Bullocks, Sheep,
Fouls, and Vegetables provided by order of the Dey to be sent off
to us; and shall immediately after make sail for Tripoly - Col: Lear
has been favourably r e d The Usual Salutes were passed between
the Constitution and the Garrison on anchoring - I was on Shore
esterday and received under a Salute of Cannon from the Marine
!Lattery; and treated with politeness and attention I believe our
Nation Stands as high with this Regency as any of the European
Nations, and perhaps hi her.
The two Ships the jetsea, Walker, aod the OM Tom loaded on
account of the United States have both arrived safe- and the Store
Ship the Traveller loaded with provisions for the Squadron, passed
this plare the day before yesterday, under convoy of the Enter

all times have one of our strongest Frigates full manned a t Gibraltar
and a Schooner or Brig to prevent either of the Barbary Powers from
passing through the Straits to capture our Merch' Vessels in case of

any sudden rupture; and I cannot but agree with him that i t is necessary, as there is not any dependence to be made on these capricious
Tyrants - A force known to be stationary near the Straits will
make our peace more secure with them all. I enclose you some
remarks of Mr OBrienls on the Regency of Algiers in his own words The Dey is now in the Country a t his seat & expected in Town
tomorrow but previous to his going out he left orders for Col: Lear
to be received by his Prime Minister, and to be acknowledged as
Consul. The Col I suppose will give every requisite information to
the Secretary of State - I t is the custom of all the European Nations
to salute their Consuls with 7 Guns on their first visiting and leaving
their Ships of War arriving in any of the ports in these Seas - I
think we should not respect our Consuls less than other Nations do
theirs, as it has an unfavourable effect on the Barbary Powers particularly - I have therefore saluted on such occasions; and I submit
to you whether it will not be proper for an order to issue from the
Navy Dep' to all the Commanders to this effect.

SIRI beg leave to nc uctint you of my arrival here after a passage
of nine daps from Gibrn ter, without any thing occuring worth notice
with the ship and schooner under my Convoy.
The morning after our arrival we were visited by the health Officer,
and by what I could learn from fiim our Quarentine would be but
short, I Iikewise went on shore in order to get Mr Appleton and Messr?
Dagen and Purviance, to make what interest they could for our
being soon admited to Prottigue, but the weather being very bad
and a hard gale of wind from the westward, i t Prevented my heamg
from them for four days past, till this evening a boat from Messr@
Dagen and Purviance came off, and informed me the time of my
Quarentine was fixd a t eight days,
I immediately sent Mr Blake on shore to the health officer, to
know the reason of our being obliged to perform a longer Quarintine
than the Syren, she being from the same port and under the same
Circumstances, they gave for answer that they did not know when
the Syrcn arrked of the fever at Malaga, or she would have been subject to the same Quarentine,
The letters that I had in charge were sent on Shore but they would
not receive them, I shall send them on board the ship that came
under my Convo ,so that in four or five days they will be forwarded,
there are a num er of American ships in this port, but none bo~md
to the westward under ten or fifteen days, and perhaps uot more than
two or three within twenty,

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1803 TO 1804

I have heard from Mersailles by an American ship from that port,
and find there are no american Vessels there that will be ready for
sea under ten or fifteen days, and then but one or two, As that is the principal port for commerce and so few Vessels there,
and the season being so far advanced which makes it dangerous keeping the north shore, oweing to the South west and west winds which
blow almost the whole time,
I have determined to make the best of my way to Gibralter without stoping a t any port, unless I am forced in by contrary winds or
some accident, and hope the steps I am about to take may meet your
approbation,
The Syren is here and I believe she sails the first fair wind, the
weather has been such that I have not been able to see C f ~ ~ t a i n

Duplicate. Nq 3.
ALGIERS,December 2"e 1805.
SIR,I had the honor of writing to you on the 18'Q of October from
Gibr~ltar,by the U. States Ship New York, in which I informed you
that I expected to sail in a few dtlys for this place; but on the 2 2 4
Commodore Preble sailed in the Constitution for Cadiz, to get a cable
and sundry Articles of which he stood in need, and which could not
be procured at Gibmltar. - He expected to return in a few days;

246

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1803 TO 1804

but contrary winds detained him until the 6th of Novr when he came
back to Gibraltar, where he was detained 'till the 13tQwhen we sailed,
in company with the U. S. Schooner Nautulus, and the Brig Argus,
which was to take a convoy to Leghorn, and return again to the Straits,
which will be her stat.ion for the winter. On the 18@ we entered the Bay of Algiers, when Mr OBrien came
off, and as the wind was too light to permit of the Ship's getting to
the anchoring birth, he remained on board all night. And the next
day, about noon, I went on shore with him, and was received, on my
landing, with the usual friendly salute of seven Guns. - The Dey
being at his Country House, and not expected in the City 'till Thursday, the 24th, I could not have an Audience 'till that time; but he
sent to inform me that he should receive me with muchp1easure.On the 30th the Conlmodore came on shore, (the Ship having been
saluted with 21 Guns on her anchoring) and returned on bonrd in the
afternoon, after having made arrangements for sundry articles of
fresh provision &$ & $ which he might want, over and above the customary present which had been sent on board. - On the 2la$he
got everything he wished; and sailed, with the Nautdus, for Tripoli. I was much disappointed in not finding here the U. States Brig
Syren, which left Gibraltar on the 24tQ of October for Leghorn, to
bring over the Consular Present which Mc Cathcart had provided a t
that place: And as the Dey had been informed of my having been at
Gibraltar some time since, and was daily expecting me, with the
Consular present, he would be highly disappointed at not receiving it
with me, and might make some difficulty in receiving me, on that
account, especially too, as all the annuities had not arrived, and had
been so long promised. As he had been favourable impressed towards me, and appeared to
be very friendly disposed towards us a t present, I thought it would
be highly impolitic to do a n y t . h g which might give a different aspect
to our Affairs; and therefore determined to make an arrangement for
the present here, if those from Leghorn should not arrive in time. I
found that the House of Bocris & Busnach were always provided
with those articles which it was customary to give on such occasions;
and upon a full communication with M' OBrien and others, on the
subject, it was strongly urged that our affairs would be placed upon a
much better footing to take the Presents from them, and to use their
influence therewith, with the Dey (which seems to be great) if it shd be
necessary to continue his patience for the Balance of the Annuities,
and as the Articles from Leghorn mould always sell here, if necessary,
for their cost there. - I accordingly Agreed with them, that they
should furnish the present, to the entire satisfaction of the Dey &
Regency, for twenty thousand dollars; and that they should undertake fully to satisfy him for any deficiency in the annuities which wore
due on the 5th of September, at the rate of thirty thousand dollars
per year, in Cash, for what might be wanting. - After some negociation I effected this: And on Thursday Morning the Dey sent to inform
me he was ready to receive me. I went to the Palace about 9 Oclock,
with Mr OBrien and the Drogerman &$ &$- The Dey received me
with great apparent satisfaction, and had the President's letter interpreted to him, with which he seemed much pleased. He expressed
strong iriendship for our Nation, and paid me many compliments,
saying he should depend upon me to hold the balance fairly between

WARS WlTH BARBARY POWERS

him m d my Country according to our Treaty - That he liked a

Consul with a clean face, and that I might always be assured of his
protection, and of everything his Country afforded. He also expressed
his satisfaction with the conduct of my predecessor since he had been
here. - The audience lasted about half an hour. - At eleven oclk
we returned to the Palace with the presents for the Dey, carried in
form. - He examined them with much attention, seemed highly
pleased, and expressed his happiness in being on good terms wi$h the
Unit-ed States. In the afternoon I went to visit the heads of Departments at their
severai Houses, in the follouing order - The Prime hiCinister - The
Aga, or General of the Turks. - The Hogia de Cavallor, or General
of the Horse - and the JTickelhadge,or hlinister of Marine. - To
each of these a present was carried, as is customary. - They all
appeared highly pleased, paid me many compLimFS and repeated,
again and again, the pleasure they should take in shew-hg their
friendship to the U. States, and tbcir readiness to render me any
service. The foIlou-ing day was spent in sending the presents to the inferior
Officers; none of whom were visited by me in form, as it is not customary for Consuls to pay particular attention to any but the high
Officers. On thc 27'h I went, with Mr OBrien, to the Minister of Marine,
and informed hin~of our intention to change our Medittmanean
Pmports, and shewed him one of the new Passports; at the same
time informing him, agreeably to my instructions, of t,he time which
wQ elapse before the new one shg be alone in use; and in the mean
timc, that either the old or the new should be considered as sufEcient; - but instead of nineteen months being allowed for the full
exchange, I mentioned two years, (consisting of twelre Iunar months
each) in order to give ample time for the exchange to be made by all
-4merican Vessels. - Tlis tinle was readily acceded to, and the business being fully explained, the minister esprcsscd his full satisfaction,
with assurances tliat it shd be ~articularlyobserved. - As this is
a businrss entirely in the marine Dtlpartment, the communication
was properly made here. - I ~ishrdto have made it in writing;
but hlr OBricn and the other Consuls assured me it was never done. This fomial communication, in presence of the Drogerman, bcing
aU that is required, and that notes are made of it in the Department. On the 289 b e n t , by the Drogernlan, a fornxnl message, announcing
the Blockade of Tripoli, agreeably to the Official information thereof,
given me by Commodore Preble.
The nine Cruizers wiJch sailed from this Port on the 3d of October,
on a cruize on the Coast of ISaples & Sicily, returned Into Port yesterday, bringing about 150 Captivcs whom they bad tukon from the
land, and out of small coasting craft. - They brouglit no prizes in
with them. - They consist of one frigate of 44 Guns, budt here another of the some force, taken by the former, some time since, from
the Portuguise - the Crescent, built in the U.States three Xebecks
from 20 to 30 Guns - the Brig & two Schooners b d t in the U.

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1805 TO 1804

The Biennial Present had been made by Mr OBrien, before my
arrival, out of the 30,000 dollars in his hands. - This amounted to
16,000 dollg. 4000 more he says he has taken to his own account
and for Consular Expenccs - and 10,000 is to be paid to the Jews
on account of the Consular Present &F aid to the Dey, at the time I gave him the Consular present,
six t ousand eight hundred dollars, for the Ransom of Capt"Andrew1
Morris & crew. - The Debt of fifteen thousand $ seventy five dollars,
due to the Jews, is to be paid when I pay them for the Consular
present, which will be done as soon as they furnish their accounts.
Mr OBrien yesterday received a letter from Dr Davis, at Tunis, a
copy of which is enclosed. - I shall write to Dr Davis to take care of
our Affairs a t Tunis until I see him in the Spring, and in the mean time
to keep me fully informed of every thing which relates to us in that
quarter.
As I have been here so short a time, you will not, of course, expect
I can go into any detail of our affairs from my own knowledge. Every thing appears a t present very favourable to us; and I think it
justice to Mr OBrien to say that he seems to have conducted our
affairs with great adroitness, to keep the Dey in good humour, when
we have been so tardy in our annuities; and must add that he appears
to be very willing and able to give me full information on every
point. - I must here express my astonishment to find, that even if
the other Ship should arrive with the Timber &q we shall be so far
from being in advance to the Regency, that there will be a very considerable sum due to make up the deficiency to the 5'Q of Se e
last. - The first Ship which arrived brought a Cargo for the
amounting only to about 11,000 dollars - and the Second (The Old
Tom,by which this letter goes) brought but 3000 dollars. - The Ship
expected will not probably, from her size, have more than the last;
in which case we shall still be in debt more than one year for the
Annuities. - How tbis has happened I cannot tell; but it is certainly
very unfortunate; and I fear very much for the Ship expected (The
Sally, Capt-cher)
as CaptQCornick of the Old Tom, now here,
says she had put back to Norfolk, with the loss of her foremast, - was
repaired, and expected to sail from thence the day after he came
out; - and that she was so old and so bad a ship that no person in
Norfolk would insure upon her. - Should we fall so much behind
hand as I expect, and the Dey insist upon an immediate payment of
the balance, I shall be drained of all my money, and have no resources
for our business a t Tripoli or Tunis, should any arrangement take
place with the former; but I cannot help entertaining a hope, from
my knowledge of Commodore Preble, and from some other circumstances, that we shall lower the haughty tone of that Regency. I have the honor to enclose the copy of a letter from Commodore
Preble, and his answer, on the subject of my going to Tripoli in the
Spring. From the little I have had an opportunity of learning and observing
here, I should not apprehend much difficulty in keeping fair with this
the stipulations
Regency, provided we are punctua2 in complyin
in our Treaty, and proper measures are taken
Consul here to
keep on good terms with the leading men; but
is observed, and the Consul has the power or means to meet any
sudden or unforeseen storm, I presume we shall always be in danger

of a Rupture, and the situation of a public Agent here very precarious
and unpleasant. - I shall not fail to keep in view the several points
mentioned in my instructions, and push them, as I may find fair &
f avourable opportunities.
The English Consul, Mr Falcon, who was sent from hence last
summer, by the Dey, leit Gibrdtar some time before I sailed from
thence, to go to Lord Nelson, off Toulon, who, it was said, was ordered
to see him restored to his Post; but they seem to laugh a t the idea
here of his being forced upon them.
At the close of the present month, I shall make up my accounts
and forward them to you, when I hope to be able to give you a more
minute detail of our affairs in this quarter.

December SQ1803. I take the liberty of informing your Excellency, that this morning
the Dey sent in great haste for M' OBrien, my predecessor, and myself

to the Palace. - When we went there we found him in a great rag(.,
threatening to put to death some of the Captains of his Cruizers which
had lately been out, for having taken a Vessel from Malta, which was
under the protection of the British, and had Sir, Alexr Ball's pnssport,
and carried her into Tunis, where she had been sold. - He said he had
sent for us to give us an evidence of his justice towards the British that, altho' he had sent the Consul out of the Country last summer, it
was an act of mercy on his part, as he had so far violated their laws
that he would not have been safe from the outrages of the people &c that notwithstanding this, he considered himself bound by his Treaty
with the King of England, whose friendship he most highly valued and that he was very desireous of having a new Consul sent to rcnew
& confirm his friendship &c - that i jhe (tho Dey) should permit the
former Consul to return he would not be safe from the violence of the
Moors. - He requested Mr OBrien & myself to write to your Excellency, or any other of the British Governors or Commanders who would
be most likely to let his disposition towards the British Nation be
known to the Government. - At the intercession of the Ministers
&F - the Captains were saved, but were all dismissed from the De 's
service. - If any good should result from a communication of t is
disposition on the part of the Dey (let it proceed from what course it
may) I shall feel peculiarly happy in having been the organ of it. - In

SIR I had the honor of Fmiting you on the l!jtQ
Ult? giving a Cypher,
which would enable us to correspond without any danger of our private communications benefitting this Govermt, in case of detection.
For fear that said Cypher may miscarq, I now send you another on
the same plan, but alphabetically varied. Your letters which does
not contain any private matter, had best be directed to the care of
the British Consul, and those of a private nature, you had better get
the Danish Consul a t Malta, to enclose to his colleague in this place.
The greater part of our crew consists of English subjects, not
naturalized in America; Suppose Lord Nelson was to claim them, and
to enforce his demand, would it not be policy in the United States,
to accede to such a measure? Interest, and Humanity, would (in
my opinion) sanction an acquiescence.
This day, two Gallies returned from a cruise, and brought in 13
Sardinian, and 3 Sicilian persons. The Marine force of this Regency
(as near as I can learn, being confined to the house, prerents giving
accurate informntion,) consists of one folacre Ship, 1 New Brig proper
rigged 14 Guns, - 1 Schooner ready for launching, rery tant Masts,
10 Guns. - 5 Gallies latteen Sails; 4 6: 6 Guns 50 to 60 Men - 12
Gun Boats, two of which, are small, the others carry heavy Metal,
all in port, and 1 Xebeck at Derne.
The unfortunate Frigate lies moored in the Harbour, with all her
Guns. They took them up from off the rocks in the depth of 12 8:
14 feet Water. I think it very practicable with six or Eight good
Boats well rnrtnned, and determined OEcers to destroy her, and their
Cruisers, particulady if the thing was attempted without giving them
much warning; for all their Gun Boats at present, are hauled up on
Shore, and I am told, that there is only a four Gun Battery badly
mounted, that points towards the Harbour, which could be easily
silenced, after gctting possession of the Ship. Powder and Shot should
be brought in one of the Boats, to sup ly the Guns on board the Frigate. By chartering a Merchant Vesse , and sending her into the Harbour, with the men secreted and steering directly on board the Frigate,
i t might be effected without any or a trifling loss. I t would not be
possible to carry the Fri ate out, owing to the difficulty of the Channel. I beg that you wi not consider me too officious, in giving my
ideas on a conjectural practicability.
The Harbour of Tripoly is fortified by nature; they have a number
of Guns on their Batte , pointing to the Southwq which will prevent
Frigates ~ c t i n geffectua ly on the Town. A blockade bas, and ever
will be found a wrong system to pursue, with this Regency; it is only
barding a great risque (aI have fatally expsriencexf) without the

least effect, except the Interest of a few Jewish Merchants. The
Country abounds with plenty, and every super-fluous supply can readily
be got from Tunis bv Land. The situation of their Harbour, and coast
is such, that their smrtll cruisers which are the most dangerous, can
always go to Sea, and return into port in s ite of the most viaailant
cruisers stationed off here. The passage etween Cape Bon and
Sicily is an important place to gunrd; and our small Vessels to cruise
on the coast of Italy, Spain, and Sardinia, would probably detect
their Cruisers, which endangers our Trade and which in general
should have convoy given it. This System I verily believe, to be
the best to pursue; had it fortunately been the case, 1should not now
regret the loss of my services to my Country.
Whatever measures my Commodore you may pursue, patriotism
to my Country, and sincere friendship to yourself, will cause me to
offer my fen-ent prayers for their success. I know they nil] be
actuated by the purest motives, and dictated by a eomprehensire
mind. Would to God! I was this moment under its inhence.
I hope that you and Col. Lesr, will feel yourselres justified to ask
the demands of the Bashaw immediately, so that we may be able too
form some opinion of the probability of our Government complying
with them. France would be found a good mediator, but not to be
negotiated thro' their Consul.

SIRI had the honor to write you from Algier's Bay, after landing
Col. Lear and family, since which, no opportunity has occurred
until1 now. I left that Ray on the 22nd November, to proceed off
Tripoly, with the Nautilus in company; and on the 24 t+ off the S W
end of Sardinia, spoke an English Frigate from Malta, the Capt of
which, informed me of the loss of the Philadelphia on the rocks off
Tripoly, but was not able to give me the particulars of the distressing
intilligence, which induced me to steer for Malta, to gain further
information - On the 26th between the Island of Maritimo and
Cape Bon, chased and boarded a Tunisine Xebeck of 18 Guns on a
cruise, with the passport of George Davis. American Charge des
affairs at Tunis, and permitted her to proceed - dTtQ arrived off
the Harbour of Malta, and sent in a Boat with nn O5cer on Shore,
who returned with letters from Captain Bainbrid e dated a t Tripoly,
stating the particulars of the capture of the f%iladelPhia by the
Tripolines, without a man on either side having been killed or
wounded; with the mortifying circumstance that she was in the
Harbour of Tripoly. - This affair distresses me beyond description,
and very much deranges my lans of operation for the resent. 1
fear our national character
sustain an injury with t e Barbarians. - Would to God, that the Officers and crew of the Philadelphia,
had one and all, determined to prefer death to slavery; it is possible
such a determination might save them from either - Enclosed is
Capt. Bainbridge's account of tho business; with sundry other papers

the 1st and 6th m t o , as i t is possible for me to - Soon after the
Boat returned from Malta, a heavy gale of Wind came on from the
N. W. The sea was tremendous in the charnel, and the ship laboured
much:-I stood across to the Northward, under reefed courses and
Storm Staysails, and fetched under the lee of Scicily; where I had
smooth water; and on the 29th the gale subsided.
I fell in with the Enterprize Lt Decrttur, who informed me, that the
store Ship Traveller was a t Syracuse. I accordingly made sail for,
and entered the port, the next mornv. I immediately waited on the
Governor for permission to deposit our Provisions & Stores, which
he not only readily granted, but assigned me the use of the Arsenal,
with compleat covering for our Boats and Spars, and v e q excellent
Magazines that will contain five thousand Barrels of provisions; and
all these free of expence! - He considers himself under obligations
to us, for making this port our rendez~ous,as it will prevent the
Tripolines from cruising on this part of the coast of Scicily. - This
Harbour is one of the best in the Mideterranean, and the country will
afford us fresh Meat, Vegetables, Fruit, Candles, and Rice, cheaper
than they can be purchased in America. The Inhabitants are
t
In fact,
extremely friendly and civil, and our Sailors c a ~ o desert,
I think it by far the best place for the Squadron to rendezvous at.
The almost constant hea$y gales of Wind, and extreme bad weather
since our arrival here, has prevented us from compleating our Stock
of Wnter, and finishing landing the cargo of the Store Ship, untill to
day. I have bent a new suit of sails - The Enterprize is new rigged,
and the Nautilus in fine order. We sail tomorrow for the coast of
Tripoly, and are we1 prepared for a Winter's Cruise. I shall remain
off the coast, as long as it is possible for any of their cruisers to keep
out; but I do not think it w i l l be possible to cruise all Winter without
hazarding too much; for should any accident happen to this ship,
and any of the other Barbary Powers should break out upon us, the
Consequences may be dreadful to our commerce in these Seas. - On
my arrival near Tripoly, I shall send a fltlg on shore, to h o r n the
present situlttion of the Captives, and learn the Bashaw's disposition
and expectations, and to establish a necessary supply of Money for
the comfort and health of the Officers & Crew, and by this means, I
shall learn the present disposition of their Kaval force. - I suspect
the demands of the Bashaw, since he has the Philadelphia and Crew
in possession, will be enormous; of course, Government will feel the
necessity of sending out an additional force, to supply the loss of that
ship. - One Ship never ought to cruise alone on the Coast of Tripoly,
if it can be avoided. If two Ships are in company, and an accident
of running on shore happens to one, the other can protect her whilst
getting off - and the same protection would be wanted, in case of
losing a Mast, by engaging the Batteries.
If it had not have been for the Capture of the Philadelphia, I have
no doubt, but we should have had peace with Tripoly in the Spring;
but I have now no hopes of such an event - If you send me another
Frigate or two, and a Frigate to relieve the Argw a t Gibraltar, so
that I can have the services of that Bri , I will so compleatly Blockade
Tripoly and annoy the Coast, as to essen the Bashaw's demands,
more than double the expence of the reinforcement, and perhaps
oblige him to sue for peace.

'i

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1803 TO 1804

I do not believe the Philadelphia will ever be of service to Tripoly;
I shall hazard much to destroy her -it will undoubtedly cost us many
lives, but i t must be done. I am surprized she was not rendered use-

less, before her Colours were struck.
I am sorry to inform you, of the death of Mr Deblois purser of this
ship. he was sick for about three weeks, and died soon after our
arrival here. The service has sustained the loss of an Officer of Merit
in his station. I have appointed Mr Noahdia[h] Morris (late Chaplain) as his successor, and Mr P. Leonard (late Capt" Clerk) I have
appointed Chaplain, who will also continue to do the duty of a clerk I hope the President will do me the honor and favour, to confirm the
appointments - If he knew their merits as well as I do, he would
not hesitate.
The Beef sent out in the Store Ship, and branded George Tou-n, I
Krouse & C ? is miserably poor, and badly put up: - Indeed, nothing
but absolute necessity will induce the people to eat it. Most of the
Casks are the worst sort of fish Barrels, and very few of them full
hooped; in consequence of which, the Pickle has leaked out, and the
provisions spoiled. - Several bbi8 have been condemned and thrown
overboard, being too offensive to be retained in the ship. - I believe
it will be for the Interest of Government, to ship all the Beef from
Boston, or Connecticut. The Pork, Rice, Flour, Bread &cGs good,
but the Casks are in very bad order. A quantity of Bread, and other
Provisions and Stores, have arrived at Malta from Gibraltar, sent up
by Mr Gavino. - Mr Pulis complains of their not having been consigned to him, but to an English Mercht I shall settle the business,
by taking the whole of them over here, as I return from my present
cruise. As we have no consul or Agent here, and I do not chuse to
trust our Provisions & Stores in the hands of Strangers, I have placed
Mr George Marcellin and Mr Charles Morris, Midshipmen, in charge
of the Public Stores untill I return. I take the precaution to leave
two, in case of accidents.
Mr McDonough a Midshipman belonging to the Philadelphia, that
%as left by her prize a t Gibraltar, and afterwards joined this Ship, I
have ordered to join the Enterprize, Notwithstanding we are well
accomodated here for Magazines to deposit our Provisions & Stores,
Yet, still, a ship that would Answer for a Store and Hospital Ship,
would be much preferable, for it is uncertain how soon we may be disturbed by the Frencb or English taking possession of this Country.
I shall write you immediately on my return from this cruise, and hope
to be able to give you more correct information respecting our affam
with Tripoly, than I can at present. If a Frigate comes out to reinforce the Squadron, will it not be well for her to stop at Algiers and take
Col. Lear on board? as i t will prevent the necessity of my sending a
vessel after him in the Spring. Mr Gadson whose health does not permit him to attend to duty, has requested leave to return to the United
States, and I have charged him with my dispatches - Z sent ou a
memo of such Stores as it will be in our power to procure here, an such
as i t will be necessary to send out, - I shall take the earhest opportunity to survey the Islands of Pantelaria and Lampedosa and ascertain what advantages the Squadron may derive from those places. I
have an opinion, that we can make one of them our general rendezvous
in Summer, with more advantages than any other place, as thcy are
situated so near the Coast of Barbary, and directly in the track of

1

Vessels to and from Tripoly. The Articles which I can purchase here
upon terms that will make it more for the Interest of the United States,
than to send them out, are Rice, Wood, Candles, Vinegar, Wine, Hats,
Shoes, & Summer clothing. I t will be necessary to send out Rum
sufEcient for the S uadron for about 4 Months in the Year, the other
8 months, Wine
be most serviceable; and Winter clothing, such as
blue Jackes -Trowsers and Blankets only. The articles of provisions
which cannot on any terms be rocured here, are Salt Pork, Beef,
Bread, Flour, Butter, Cheese, Mo asses & Pens or Beans. In about 10
Weeks, we shall be entirely out of Molasses, Butter, Cheese, & Rum.
I t will also be necessary to send out two or three Frigate's Bower
Anchors, and as many Stream with Oak Stuff for Stocks. - Thick
or thin Duck cannot possibly be procured here; it will be necessary to
send out some of that Article, and a few thick & thin Oak plank and
boards. And if one or two lower yards for a large Frigate can be sent
here, it will be well, as we have not one in the Mediterranean, and in
case of an accident to one, it could not at present be replaced

giving an account of the loss of the Philadelphia - Lt Smith states,
that he has made use of every exertion in his power, to reach Gibraltar,
but in vain; for after having bd'etted the Seas for 22 days, experiencing nothing but constant Gales of Wind, and excessive bad weather,
he has been compelled to return. He touched at Malta on his return,
and brought me a letter from Captain Bainbridge, dated the 12th

of himself, his Officers and Crew. - Would to God, I could release
them. I t also enables me to enclose you a letter from a M' Farquhar
a Merchant at Malta, (of whom, by the by, I know very little) He
states the expectations of the Bashaw, to be ridiculously extravagant.

safety, I shall be able to make him feel the force and Weight of our
shot so effectually, as to check the extravagance of his expectations.
I shall take every proper means of endeavouring to make the situation
of Capt. Bainbrid e, his Officers and Crew, as comfortable as circumstances will possib y admit of. I ho e to be able to second the views

to the Emperor, the Ship Mishouda in the same order she was taken,
together with all the Guns, Military Stores, and Merchandise found
on board her; and all the Moors, Algerines, and Tripolitan Subjects
found on board her, were landed a t Tanger, and set a t full liberty,
to sell their Merchandize and effects, and return to their respective
countries. I hope when His Excellency the Bashaw, is made acquainted with this generous treatment of his subjects, and of our generosity
in restoring the ship Mishouda to his friend the Emperor of Morocco,
notwithstanding we could not but know she belon ed to Tripoly,

and I take the liberty of craring your Patronage in our favor I t would be trespassing upon your time to urge many Arguments on
this head, 'tis well known that our rank, & respectability while in
service unavoidably urges us to keep up a certain state of expence
that absorbs all our emoluments and nothing can be left for our families on our return to the private walks of life, many of us have large
& expensive families & our half pay is found insufficient to pay our
house rent few of us have independent fortunes and the pride and
dignity of Office will not (but upon dire necessity) brooke the descent
to menial occupations nor would it be to the credit of the U States
that we should be found retailing bunches of Onions &c. from Drogers
in forts where we had held high commands - I t may be alleged that
we are better paid than the Officers of the british naky but let it be
remembered that they are mostly men of high birth & Fortune &
they have many priviledges that we have not We cannot extend our views to any schemes of life that will require
time to mature-had we even capitals to do it, being ever liable to
be called into service and which might happen at a time when our

Morris, dated, onboard the U States Frigate Adams, September 8t'J
1803, together with a letter from the latter to the former, stating,
that as Mr Cathcart had been appointed Consul for the Regency of
Tunis, he had requested hiessrs Degen & Purviance not to advance
You the 2000 dollars for which he had given You credit with them. How far this was proper or otherwise, I shall not now undertake to say;
but presuming it must have placed You in an unpleasant ~ituation,
1 shall forward to You the like sum of two thousand Spanish dollars,
either by this oppertunity, or by land, as I may find it most safe and
expeditious, upon enquiry on the subject. - 173th respect to the
4,000 dollars for which you have become responsible on account of the
claims for Tunisian property vended a t Malta, I can only observe,
that when I have the pleasure of meeting You next Spring, as I hope
to do a t Tunis, this matter will be considered and justice done in the
case. Mr OBrien has favoured me with your letters to him of the 3G of
July & 15Q October, the former enclosing an extract of Tour letter to
the Sec? of State, of the same date, and sundry documents relative to
the redemption of Demoiselle Anna Porcile d' 1' Ile di' St Piere left
in Your charge by M' Eaton. - K i t h respect to the redemption of
this Young woman, I do not hesitate in giving my opinion that she
ought to be redeemed; and especially as you add there is no reciept
or document of any kind left in Tour hands to shew that the p a p l e n t
had been made for her by hfr Eaton; or that there was any ohligation
to pay him for her liberation as You say, in Your letter to the See?
of State, "that if commode Morris should acquiese, You should feel
yourself perfectly authorized to relinquish the further prosecution of
the claim, fully satisfied that you have no longer reason to hope for
the recovery of any part of the sum"
I trust you will not experience the evil, which you suggested as
possible to arise to you, from our naval Commanders not giving full
credence & respect to Pour passports, as I informed Commodore
Preble, that I should consider you as charged with the affairs of the
U. States a t Tunis untill we should have further advices from our
Government, and he in consequence, wrote the enclosed letter. I hare not been here long enough to form any correct judgement,
from my own observations, of the situation in which we are likely to

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS

stand with this Regency; but I have the satisfaction of finding Mr
OBrien most erfectly ready and able to communicate to me so much
of his valuab e stock of information respecting every thing here as
will be very essentially useful to me in my public Agency as well as
in my individual accommodation; and I am also pleased to add that
he will remain here during the winter. We have satisfied the Biennial & Consular presents, and have received two cargoes of Timber from the U. States towards paying the
two Annuities due on the 5tQof September - Another ship has been
expected for some time; but we now almost dispair of her arri-ral Should she not come, we must endeavour to make an arrangement to
pay the balance, which may be due in Cash. - The Dey & great
Officers appear to be in good humour, a t present, with the U. States;
but in these Latitudes we have no right to calculate upon a long spell
of favorable weather - I only wish I may be able to keep as good a
helm in the squalls & Gales, as my predecessor appears to have done;
but he is an experienced navigator in these Seas. I am happy to inform You that our difl'erences with the Emperor
of Morocco were satisfactorily adjusted early in October. - A concurrence of fortunate events put into our hands one of the En~peror's
frigates, and about 160 of his subjects; and the junction of the outward and homeward bound squadrons a t Gibraltar, in a critical
moment, gave nn oppertunity of displaying a large force - effectually protecting our trade - and striking no small terror into the
Inhabitants of the Coast. -The activity of the Squadron u-as
equd to its unexpected appearance - Every Sea port in the Empire,
from Mogadore to Tituan, had or more [sic] cruisers off, to prevent
the entrance or departure of any TTessels.The Emperor came to Tangier with his Army. - Our Frigates
were drawn 11p ready to destroy his Town, if he should determine on
hostilities. - The impression was strong; and the Emperor not only
disavowed, in the most positive manner, every thing which hail been
done on his part of a hostile nature; but offered anything we could
ask - a very important point with us was to obtain a full and
unequivocal ratification of our Treaty made with his Father in 1786. This was a t once complied with; and not a denland or intimation of
a present from us, either in gross sum; or by m y of Annuity. TTe gave him up his ship & subjects as a gratuity. Thus was this
business, which threatened serious evil to the commerce of the U.
States in these seas, happily terminated in a few days. - Commodore
Uorris had returned home in the Adams before this event took place,
and lio[d]gers who Commanded the homeward bound Squadron,
behaved with patriotism and his usual activity. This event, I thinli, augers well with respect to the operations
which may be carried on against Tripoli nest season. If daring
intrepidity, united with the full esperien[c]e of a seaman, escellent
judgement & pro er prudence, can conlmand success, 1 presume
Commodore Preb e will gain Laurels for himself 6- honor for his
Country.
I have this moment received a most unpleasant piece of intelligence.
My Ilrogerman informs me that the Minister of Marine has just
directed him to tell me, that un Algerine arrived from Tunis, brmgs
accounts that one of the American Frigates off Tripoli in chasing a
Tripoline cruizer, going into Tripoli, had run on shore - that they

P

threw overboard twenty Guns in order to get her ofl; but without
effect. - that the Tripoline Gun boats went out and took her in this
situation, and afterwards got her off, and that the command of hir was
given to a Rais, formally of Algiers called Genoa.
However painful this intelligence is to me, I cannot give it credit;
for I know that no vessel has arrived in this port for 12 days past;
and if the news came by land (as they say it did) from Tunis, that You
could not have delayed a moment in forwarding to this place information of so important an event, should it have been known there; and
besides David Bocri, the Jew, informs me that he Yesterday reed
letters from Tunis, which do not mention such an event.
I t is possible notwithstanding, that i t may be true; and if i t should
be so, I think it must be the Philadelphia, as the Constitution left this
Bay on the 22d of Kovember & could not have reached Tripoli soon
enough for information of such an event to be received here. - I
pretend to give m, kind of credit to the tale, and assure them here, that
even if it could be true, it would be attended with good effects in the
end, as our Govt would see the necessity of keeping a larger force in
this sea, than may be necessav for immediate operations, to guard
against accidents of this kind; and that if this ship sllould be lost,
her place would be immediately supplied with two more. I have this day paid to David Bocri, the Jew, two thousand Spanish
dollars, for which he is to place a like sum a t Tour disposal, on account
of the U. States, in Tunis; and has given me the enclosed letter for his
correspondent Seigr Soloman Azuly, at Tunis, which he says contains
an order for a credit on him, in your behalf for two thousand dollars;
and that another letter to the same effect, will be forwarded by the
land Courier in two or three days. Enclosed is a letter which I brought from the U . States for Anthony
Nyssen Esqc Consul Gen! of the Batavian Republic
I beg the favour of you to deliver to that Gentlem
respects; also a letter from Air OBrien to You. [LC. EPP, Yol. 8, 1803-1804.1

In my former letters I mentioned that our Crew was kept employed;
the mechanics a t their respective Trades, the others a t various work.
We had on board a smart Gang of Carpenters, who are employed in
working on a new Schooner. Mr Godby [?] our head Carpenter (has
not been ordered to work before this day) has received orders from
the Bashaw to build a Gun Boat; if there is not a possitive order given
to order Crew, and perticularly to the Mechanics; Tripoli will receive
great advantage from their labour and they cannot reccire much
worse treatment than they do, for they are only allowed bread scarcely
sufficient for them to subsist on, and the Interest the Bashaw has in
their lives ill prevent him from starving them entirely. I do not
conceive it policy in me to give the order, and was I to do it; it would
not have the same weight as if come from you.
Should they persist for the fear of more severe treatment I think
they should be considered as having aleinated themselves from the

free.

LEGHORN
15th Decem: 1803.
SIR. The enclosed papers will inform you of the loss of the United
States Frigate the Philadelphia, of the deplorable situation of the
Officers & crew, & of the steps ~ h i c hI have taken to alleviate their
present sufferings until provision is made for them by government. I have not a word to offer in estenuation of this fatal accident, it
envolves incalculable consequences & changes our position not only
with Tripoli, but the whole of the Barbary States. How glorious i t would have been to have pcrish'd with the Ship,
but how apt are we all to prefer a precarious, nay un ignominious life
of slavery to a glorious death which would transmit our names to
posterity & have establish'd a national character which time could
not efface; while humanity recoils a t the idea of launching so many
souls into eternity, every thing great glorious & patriotic dictates the
measure, & our national honor & pride demanded the sacrifice. I n compliance a i t h your orders of the 16tQof last July I have deliver'd cash & effects to Mr Lear & to his ordcr to the ammount of
32,000 dollars which with the bills I accepted drawn by Mr Katon
while he remain'd a t Tunis, the credit 1have forwarded for the relief
of the crew of the Philadelphia & my own salary & expences ammounts
to a sum considerably greater than that deposited in my hnnds for
public use, exclusive of the cost of two suits of cloathing which 1 am
preparing for each of those unfortunate men, I therefore request you
to forward me cash or a credit on London to the ammount of ten thousand dollars to answer my engagements & for which I will hold myself
accountable until final setlement. The provision necessary for the crew of the Philadelphia while in
captivity will ammount to about 2000 dollars pr month, if sent out in
cash in any of our vessels of War, Malta is the most proper place for
its deposit on account of its proximity to Tripoli, if a sum is to be
negotiated for that purpose Leghorn is the only piace in the mediterranean where it can be done to advantage, Exchange upon London is
this day a t 51g for one pr da 8/r or Leghorn current dollar. If Government concludes to redeem our fellow Citizens immediately
& sue for Peace on the Bashaw's own terms, i t will cost us three
hundred thousand dollars a t least, exclusive of Consular presents &
an Annuity of ten or fifteen thousand dollars, & if a Frigate is not
given gratuitously to Tunis we will have a War with that Regency
the succeeding year to the conclusion of a Peace with Tripoli, & it is
not very probable that A l ~ e r swill view those concessions with
indifference, to carry on the War to any effect i t will be necessary to
keep constantly two or three Frigates besides the light vessels now
in this sea & ten gunboats which may be built in this Port or in
N? 16.

Naples in about five months & will cost about fifty thousand dollars,
therefore viewing our present situation in any point of view we have
little to expect but difficulty & an enormous expence, it remains for
government to determine which mode of procedure will be most
conducive to our interests.
If coercive measures had been pursued on the commencement of
the war with Tripoli we should not a t this moment be reduced to our
present humiliating situation, if an accomodation for cash should
now be determined on, it wou'd be adviseable to send it on board the
vessel that takes the negotiator to Tripoli, any sum in dollars may be
procured in Leghorn for bills upon London provided suf6cient time
is given to procure i t in, otherwise as in the purchase of Bullion in
general advantage will be taken & its price will raise in proportion to
the exigency of the demand. I have not heard of Comodore Prebble since he was on his passage
to Algiers, on his hearing of the above melancholy event, the first
idea that he will conceive as an Officer will undoubtedly be to proceed
off Tripoli with the small vessels & endeavor to entirely destroy the
remains of the Frigate if he finds their is any possibility of the Tripolitans heaving her off the bank, in order to prevent them from useing
her against us which would render them considerably more formidable
& consequently render it necessary to keep a greater force upon their
coast. I send copys of this communication & enclosures to different parts
of the mediterranean in order to facilitate its speedy arrival, & I
request you to acknowledge its receipt as soon as possible. With grief as poignant, as any of the sufferers can possibly feel for
this most unfortunate event, I have the honor to continue very respectfully. [NA. SDA. CL, Tripoli, Vol. 2, June 1801-Sept. 1805.1

gence, of the captivity of yourself, officers &: crew, and the loss of the
Frigate Philadelphk. - Unexpected and severe, as this blow is, we
must not despond; but use our best endeavors to remedy the evil, as
far ns possible. I cannot tell you, what I feel for yourself, and others
of my countrymen in captivity; but I can say, that you may depend
upon every means in my power, to soften the rigor of your situation
and give every comfort it will admit of; and that jour liberation, will
be one of the first objects of my exertion, the moment we can receive
advices from our Governmmt. In the mean time, I place full reliance
upon that fortitude, which so eminently distinguishes our countrymen, to bear their hard fate, like men, who look forward to better days.
Mr. Davis, our Charge dlAffairs, a t Tunis, has forwarded copies of
his letters to you and to Mons. Beaussirr, the Commiwuy-Gmrral,
of the French Republic, a t Tripoli, requesting his friendly assistancc,
to alleviate, as much as possible, the unfortunate situation of yoursrlf
and company. - I fully approve of this conduct of Mr. Davis, and
have authorised him to procure money, for supplying such things as
may be necessary, for relieving the wants and affording such comforts,
as their situation will admit of, to our unfortunate fellow-citizens.
I am desirous to learn the particulars of this business - as we have
only learned, that, on 30'0 of Octr in the afternoon, the Philadelphia,

chasing a Tripolitan Corsair, ran aground, about 2 mile from Tripoli
that part of the cannon, &c. were thrown overboard, to get her off, but
without effect - that in the night, eight Gun boats went out from
Tripoli, and anchored near the frigate 'till day-light; when they began
an engagement wit11 her, which continued 'till 4 P. M. when the frigate
was carried by boarding - and afterwards got off - We therefore,
apprehend, that many lives have been lost on bc the frigate, before
she was boarded.
If it can be any alleviation of your misfortune, to know, that every
one here, takes a deep & fecling interest in your situation - you will
enjoy that satisfaction in the highest degree; for no Citizen of the U. S.
has had a better opportunity than yourself, of making favorable impressions here; and none could have done it more effectually. Mons.
Thainville & his family, are sensibly afflicted with your misfortune.
He tells me, he shall write to you, by this courrier, and also, to hlons.
Beassicr, in behalf of our Countrymen.
I shall dispatch, immediately, to our Govg copies of the communications from Mr. Davis, in various directions, so as to ensure as early
a conveyance, as the season and circumstances will admit; and I
flatter myself, that the acc'%ust be on their way to the U. S. before
this, from other quarters, where they have received earlier intelligence
of the event, than we did.
Commodore Preble. left this Bay on the 21" of Novr and intended
to go off Tripoli, before he proceeded to Syracuse; so that I presume,
vou must have heard of him. The U. S. schr iVautulus, was in company with him.
I have been received here, by the Dey & Regency, with great cordiality, and they seeem to be in good humour with the 1:. S.
Mr. OIBrien, my predecessor, will remain here, 'till next spring, on
acc' of the situation of his lady - This is a pleasing circumstance to
me, as I shall hare an opportunity of profiting by his knowledge and
experience in affairs here, as nvll as in other Regencies. I presume,
he will write to you a t this time.
Mrs. Lear, sympathises most sincerely, in the misfortune of yourself and our Countrymen, she sends her prayers, and best wishes for
your & their health & deliverance Assure yourself, My Dear Bainbridge. of everything, I can do for you and my Countrymen, in their
misfortunes - Tell them, I shall not forget them. The channel. thro' which this letter oes to you, will point out a

myself they will reach Your hands in a few days. I fully approve of the step which You took in writing to Monsr
Beaussier, Commissary Gen! of the French Republic a t Tripoli, in
behalf of our unfortunate fellow citizens in captivity, and I have no
doubt but he will do everything in his power to make their situation
as comfortable as their unfortunate lot will permit - I shall do
myself the honor of writing to him by this oppertunity, confirming
the wishes & sentiments expressed in Your letter to him on this
subject
hlonsr Thainville, the Commissary Gen! of the French Republic
here, feels deepply interested in in the fate of Captain Bainbridge, as
he considers himself under great obligations for his friendly aid in
taking off himself and family, together with the other French citizens
here, when Cap! Bainbridge was a t this place in the [Qeorge] Uashington, a t the time when they were ordered to quit the Regency in 48
hours. - He is also highly esteemed by the Great men here, on
account of his Voyage (tho' a forced one) to Constantinople, with the
Regalia from the Dey, particularly by the Minister of Marine, who
went up and returned with him. I have therefore the satisfaction of
believing that measures \till be taken in various quarters, to make
the situation of himself, his officers, &- crew, as comfortable, as can be
expected in a state of captivity, untill we know what measures our
Govt will persue in this unfortunate affair. As this event took place
the last of October, I trust that information of i t is by this time far on
it's way to the U. States through the channel of Commodore Preble,
or some of our Consuls on the European Coast, who must have had
intelligence of it before i t reached this place, and who would not fail
to forward it to our Govt by the earliest and safest conveyances. - I
shall, however, forward letters to Alicant by the Spanish courrier,
which arrived yesterday & sails again in a few days, and others to
Oran, to be sent over to Gibraltar or Malaga without delay. We wait anxiously for further particulars of the capture - there
is reason to apprehend that many lives were lost in the engagement
from day light till 4 P. M. - As we can do nothing more in this
business untill advices are received from our Government, than to
endeavour to alleviate, as much as possible the bonds of captivitv
and slavery, with which our unfortunate countrymen are oppressed;
and obtain every information in our power respecting the views &
expectations of the Bashaw of Tripoli relative to the captives & the
ship; I must beg You will not fail to keep me informed of every particular on this subject, so far as You may be able to obtain information of anything which can be useful. - As the harbour of Tripoli
will not admit a Ship drawing the water of the Philadelphia, I presume
the Bashaw will dispose of her to some other power - on this point
You will be pleased to get what information You can; as well as mha t
are his expectations on the score of redemption of the captives. Information on the latter point must be obtained in an indirect
manner, and without seeming to seek for it. -

I expect David Bocri will furnish me with another letter t,o Seig'
Azuly, relative to the two thousand dollars, with which he is to supply

You; and I shall also endeavour to make arrangements with him
to have a part, a t least, of the ten thousand dollars which You are
authorized to procure in Tunis, by my letter of the 15'Q ins' furnished
by him, in case you should not have obtained it from some other
quarter. For this purpose I shall keep this letter open to the last
moment before the departure of the courier. l g t Q of December.
I have this moment had a conversation with Darid Bocri, on the
subject of furnishing the ten thousand dollars in Tunis. - He says
they have no money there and that money must be sent for the
purpose kc - so that I find, upon the wholc, he is determined to
throw obstacles in the way to obtain advantages which he ought not
to have. - I therefore pray You will draw upon me for five thousand
dollars; if you cannot obtain money by other means, and I will answer
the dft a t ten days sight; if longer it would be better. - I should
have desired you a t once to have drawn upon me for the wholc;
but have been disappointed in some money which has been expected
here from Leghorn, but has not yet arrived. - Bocri says the two
thousand dollars for which you was to have credit on Azuly, were
sent on by land to Tunis two days ago.

[l December 18031
Opinion of Hon A. J . Dallas, concerning arming of American Vessels for Defence

There is no statute of the United States that prohibits an American
Citizen from arming his Vessel, for self defence in a voyage exposed
to hazard and it has been often done on voyages to the East Indies
and to the hlediterrenean.
But generally considered, it is not regular for a Merchant Vessel
to Arm in the time of Peacc; and as the Government is responsible
for tlie Conduct of its Citizens, the object of the Armament ought
certninlg to be satisfactorily ascertained to be a lawful one.
The Armament of the Vessel in question is considerable; but the
royape is, I beleive deemed hazardous by our Merchants. - As
therefore the Charter party is corlformable to usage; as
Hollingsworth nssures you that there is no intention to sell the Vessel abroad or
to employ her in any offensive or illisit operations whatsoever I do
not think it would be proper to detain her.
But in giving this opinion; I beg to be understood as assuming no
responsibility, it is n case that merits the attention of the Government,

That is if the Bashaw would admit they would be redeemed independent of a peace; if not, I suppose that peace would cost us one
hundred thousand dollars, but those terms would be giving Algiers
and Tunis a bounty to demand extra terms, and would convince
Tripoly that we could not contend with them. I t would be giving
Tripoly a bounty to wrangle with the Swedcs, Danes, Dutch, &
Spaniards, and after they bowed to his caprice it would be our turn
again. The result of course will be more Frigates in this sea. 'CTe
should have some floating Batteries built to carry heavy cannon to
enter the port of Tripoly to attack, fire on the Toun, rake the Marine
Sea Battery, and flank the Bashaws Yalace or Castle. The same
time the Frigates with all their heavy Guns mounted on the attack
side, also we should have three or four thousand men to take possession of the Town [or Tower?] Battery when silenced by the floating
Batteries, Frigates & Gun Boats, and should you be able to procure
the Gun Boats of Kaples with this mentioned force, I tl~inl;Tripoly
will be brought to American terms. I should suppose you would
strictly Blockade Tripoly until you hear further on this tack from
our Government. You m i l l further observe how requisite it would
be for Govl to have built 4 or 6 Whale Boats on a large plan to have
each a Brass 12 pounder to row and sail with great swiftness: they
would with the Frigates and small corsairs destroy the Coasting
trade of Tripoly, at times surprize their Gun Boats, cut out Corsairs,
attack small ones take the Corsairs in tow, reconnoitre, gain i[n]ttlligence, and be of the most essential service. They should be 50 feet
Keel: they should have capital crews, and occasionally be slung over
the quarters of the large Corsairs. Experience has now convinced us
that separate corsairs should not be employed on the Coast of Barbary Our Ships should be capitally and extra manned. Well
barricadded and all calculated for Bow & Stern chaces from the Main
Batty
At Algiers the Government of Portugal has offered for Peace and
ransom of 380 captives to the amount of One Million, two hundred
thousand dollars. Should this sum tempt the Dey, the Corsairs of
this regency will have no obstruction to the VITesternOcean, and the
regency is a t Peace with two many Nations for any of the smaller
Ones to consider their Peace as durable. Some one will have to look
out for squalls. In my opinion we have no time to lose in building
the 74 Gun Ships, and 6 more large Frigates we should make a great
National exertion, and Tripoly should get what it merits from the
United States. You no doubt will have true soundings from Captain
Bainbridge. Captain Stewart arrived here this day in 24 days from
Leghorn. And also this day I have an addition to my family in the
birth of a Son. this event will permit me shortly to set out from
here on my return to the United States where I trust my information
to the heads of Dep: will be in some respects favorable to your mission
to this Sea. I t is evident we must fight, or pay, or withdraw our
sffairs from this Sea, and with a small division at Gibraltar we give

our commerce in the Western Ocean security & is clear of Tributes
and homage to Barbary. You will excuse the purport of this random
letter I presume there is not an idea hinted at, but what you must
have considered fully. One thing morc, as the port of Tripoly has
not sufEcient depth of water for the Philadelphia, that is, should the
Bashaw get her off and save the Ship, under this consideration I have
no doubt but Tunis or Algiers will consider of purchasing said Ship.
if so she should not be admitted to a pass or passage as either a Tunisian
or Algerine property. God I trust will aid and assist you is the sincere
wish of Sir

ALGIERS,Deer 21't 1805
DEARSIR,As I see a Brig off, which I suppose is the S y ~ e n ,I
prepare a few lines for you before I go on board; and am sorry to
commence our correspondence by saying, that on the l5lh ins? we
received the painful intelligence, from Mr Davis, a t Tunis, of the loss
of the U. S. Frigate Philadelphia, and capture of her crew &q by the
Tripolines. - You m w t undoubtedly have known of this disastrous
event long before this, and I feel anxious to hear what measures you
intend pursuing in consequence. - I have authorized Mr Davis to
give to our unfortunate fellow Citizens all the relief that their situation will admit of, and have also written to Monsr Beaussier, the
French Commissary Gen! a t Tripoli to do everything in his power, to
alleviate their misfortlmes, which I have no doubt will be done. I
wrote to Capt Bainbridge a t the same time, and forwarded letters to
him & to the French Comm? Gent from Mon* Thninville the French
Charge dlAffairs here, who feels deeply interested in the fate of
Capt? Bainbridge & from the services which he renderd him & his
Itation when here in the [George] M7ashingfon. - I have had much
conversation with the Jews & others here, who are acquainted with
those officers, respecting the Ransom of our Countrymen; but i t
seems to be n general opinion that it cannot be done, without blending
a peace with that transaction. Should this be the case, we must
wait orders from home, before any steps can be taken in the business. - The Jews Estimate is five hundred thousand dollars for
Ransom & a peace; but this is out of the question. The Sweedish Consul tells me that when they made peace with
Tripoli they redeemed about 150 captives, which, with the peace,
amounted to 150,000 dollars, and tbls was thought extravagant. The Dey & Regency here appear a t present in good humour with
us; but this unfortunate event will have an effect on all our Barbary
affairs. - If the Tripolines have got the Philadelphia off, they cannot
use her in their port, and must sell her to some other power, and, in
that case, I think the Dey will endeavour to get her. I am sorry to inform you that one of the Ships which has been
expected here with the Annuities, was lost on the 20tP ultq on the Bar
of St Lucar, near Cadiz. M' Iznardi writes me that the Vessel is
totally lost, but he hopes some of the cargo will be saved. - This is
peculiarly unfortunate a t this moment, especially as the two cargoes

286

NA'C7AL OPERATIOhW FROM 1805 TO 1804

received here will not pay one of the Annuities due here last Septr and we shall owe a balance of more than 30,000 dollr on that a c d I was obliged to employ 20,000 doll9 of the money I brought here in a
Consular present, as the Dey had been long expecting me; more,
perhaps, on account of the expected present, than on any other, and
as he had been disappointed in the Annuities which had been so long
promised, he might heleive we intended to deceive him on every
tack, if the present did not accompany me. I am rejoiced that I did
so, since we hare heard of the fate of the Philadelpllia, as he has now
no fair pretext to be hard upon us, as he wd be disposed to take
advantage of it, a t this moment, if he had. - I have always been
fully of opinion, in which I flatter myself you cordially join with me,
that we sh* be jaithjul & punctml in all our stipulations with these
people however unpalatable it may be; and we sh'J then be able to
repel any extra demand nlth a good face. The Cruizers of this Regency returned into port on the 2StC ultimo,
without any prizes. They sold one, a Maltise, a t Tunis; but as she
had a protection, the D r y ordered her to be restored, liberated the
Crew, and broke some of his Captains.
The English are out of credit here, a t present. Mr Falcon has
not make his appearance; but I think if Lord Xelson could come u ith
his Ships, he wd have all he could ask. The Cruizers are strip'd & laid up for the minter. - They consist
of 2 Ships of 44 Guns - 1 of 36 (the Crescent) 3 Xebecks from 20 to
30 Guns 2 Polacres of 20 - 1 Brig of 18 - 2 Schooners of 16 & 18
Guns, the three last American built. Capt-tewart
has had a long passage of 24 days from Leghorn, &
some very bad weather. He takes in some water & fresh provisions
here & \ d l proceed to Syracuse. MrBLear enjoys good health, and unites with me in respects & best
wishes for yourself and the O6cers of your Ship. - I am anxious to
hear from you & to know what measures you propose to pursue in the
Spring. - The Argus left Leghorn with the Syren.

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1803 TO 1804

To Anthony Merry, British Minister to the United States, from Secretary of State

DEPARTMENT
OF STATE,

Decr 2dth 1803.
SIR.I have received from the Collector a t one of our Ports a copy
of an American Ships Register, on which is endorsed as follows:
"Every port in the Island of St Domingo being in a state of blockade
by His Britannic Majesty's Squadron, you are hereby warned off
from that Island, and if seen or found within three leagues of tbe
land after the date of this, you will be made a prize off. Given under
mv hand on board His Majesty's Ship Bellerophon off Cape Francois
26" Octr 1803, (signed) John Loring" -, on t h face
~ of the document
and t h o u g h its contents is written the same notice in substance signed
by the same Commander.
In case of a real blockade, and of a customary warning thereof to
h'eutral Vessels, it might justly be expected that more respect would
be shewn to so solemn and so permanent an instrument as the Register
of a Ship, than to select it for such a purpose, and particularly to
deface i t in such a manner. Other papers of the Ship, the clearance
for example, u.hich could not be safely destroyed with a view to
surpress the intended proof might certainly be substituted with more
propriety, and with sufficient effect: And there would be the greater
reason in committing the notice to an occasional document, as the
notice itself might be limited to thr occasion: whereas if attached to
a permanent document, i t might subject the neutral Vesscl indefinitely
to interruptions, neither warrantable nor contemplated. But you
will readily perceive Sir, that these remarks do not touch the primary
object which demands attention. Here is another and still more
extraordinary instance in which a blockade is pretended and declared
by a few Ships against a u-hole Island, of n s t extent and abounding
with ports and places of commerce. Persuaded that so gross a violation
of the rights of neutrality will sufficiently speak for itself, and rncl;~
its own appeal to the justice, the honor and the friendly dispositions
of your Government, I forbear to malie any comment on it, fartller
than to refer to that contained in my letter of the 27t? October last
to Mr Thornton, on a sin~ilarproceeding against our commerce with
the Island of Aiartinique and Guadaloupe. I must request, howerer
that in addition to thc communications which you will doubtless
make to your Government on this subject, you will take such other
steps as will be most likely to remove without delay, a source of so
much injury and irretation, not only in this last case, but in the one
preceeding which is not known to have been discontinued.
I cannot dismiss this subject without calling pour attention to u.
circumstance which is no inconsiderable aggravation of the principd
wrong. The American Vessel is informed that if found, after the
notice given, within three Leagues of any port of the Coast, it will
subject her to the consequences of violating the blockade. If it
were the intention to extend the Territorial Jurisdiction of the Island
three leagues from the shore, it might be aslied on what authority this
distance is prescribed? it might be asked on what pretext any Territorial jurisdiction could be assumed by those who do not occupy a
single foot of the Island? If it were intended that the mere appearance
of the Vessel within the given distance should be taken for proof of
her steering for a blockaded port, the question not only recurs as to
tbe reality of the blockade, but it might be asked with what colours

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS

291

such a proof could be drawn from a circumstance which might result
either from the casualties of the weather and seas or from a Voyage
to otber Islands or places, for which such a course is known to be often
most convenient, and even absolutely necessary. In making this
communication to you Sir, which is done by an express charge from
the President, I feel a perfect confidence that you will do justice
equally to its importance and to its motives. Our two Nations have
eTery reason to cultirate the good understanding which subsists
between thcrn, and the cordiality with which it continues to be promoted on the part of the United States has been too thoroughly
manifested to be called inbo doubt. They have the best grounds
therefore to expect and to claim in return every proof of justice and
respect which is due to the example on their side, and to the interests on both sides: They look for those returns more particularly
in the case of their maritime rights, because it is in the case of these
that they hare hitherto had most ground of complaint; because it
is in the case of these that their sensibility is a t this moment awakened; and because in the srtme case therefore a reciprocity of justice
and of respect will contribute most to consolidate the friendly and
beneficial relations to which the two Nations are respectively united.

SIR The letters and papers u-hich I have now the honor t.o enclose,
will inform you of the unfortunate fate of the U. States Frigate
Philadelphia, and the captivit,y of her crew by the Tripolitans, 8 s
well as of the steps which have thus far been taken in consequence
of that disastrous event. - ITe h a w had no accounts since the

292

SAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1803 TO 1804

letters of D' Davis of the 16th & 17th of Novr excepting, that the
Danish Consul here, says he has received a letter from the Danish
Consul at Tripoli, informing that the Frigate had not been got off;
and that Cap: Bainbridge & his people were well treated &? - I
have taken all oppertunities of endeavouring to learn, by every
indirect manner, what might be the expectations of the Bashaw of
Tripoli with respect to Ransom; and I find i t is generally believed,
that unless a peace is effected, with a Ransom, the latter will be high,
if attainable. - The estimate is as follows. Ransom of 307 persons @ 1000$- - - - _- _ - - - - 307,000
- - - - - - - - _ - - - - - - 100,000
Peace- - - - -,

But this is certainly too high, as the Bashnw has hitherto receired
but 5 or 600 dollars per man, from other powers when they have
redeemed their subjects and made peace. - We must, however wait
for illformation from Tripoli, to know what impression this event
bas made there, before we can form anp just opinion on the subject. And all I can do w i U be to obtain the best information in my power,
to enable me, or any other person, to act in this business, when ever
the orders of our Government may be received relative to rt. - I
have not heard from Commodore Preble since the News of this event;
but am anxious to knoK what steps he means to pursue in consequence
of it. ,4s this event will have its effects on all these regencies, with respcrt
to the U. States, as they may see the measures which will be talicn in
consequence of it,; it remains with the Governmf to decide, whether
they will send a force into this sea, not only equal to finishing the
business with Tripoli; but to keep the other Regencies in awe; - or
expend in Ransom and a peace nearly 500,000 dollars. with a certainty
of having demands increase upon us from the other p o w r s ; - or withdraw our Trade entirely from the Mediterranean. - Should this last
measure be determined upon, I must add, that it would be necessary
to keep nearly, or quite as many Vessels to guard the Straits, and prcvent Cruizers from going into the Atlantic, as to effect the first; especially too, as I am well informed that the Portuguise are upon the
point of concluding a peace with this Regency, which mill open to
their Cruizers the whole range of the Atlantic, from which they have
kept them for so many years. - I n addition to this Misfortune, I
receivd letters from the Consular House a t Cadiz, dated Nov' 2Sth
informing me of the loss of the Ship Sally, on the Bar of St Lucar, on
the 20th of Nor' with a cargo of Timber &F on board, ns a part of our
Annuities due the 5th of Septr. The TTesselwas Iost and i t was uncertain whether any of the cargo would be saved or not. - This will
render our settlement with the Regency more difficult than if she had
arrived, as we shall have a much larger sum to pay in cash, even if
they consent to receive it. - I wait to here further from Cadiz, if any
part of the cargo has been saved, to make i t worth while to ship it
round here; before I press the settlement for cash; and especially as I
have not all the Cash in hand (which would be a great ob'ect) and
must depend upon the Jews for a part of it, with whoom I wis to have
as little to do as possible.

The U. States Brig Syren arrived here from Leghorn on the 20th

of nineteen thousand, five hundred & ninety three dollars & 3 cents in
articles which he had prepared for the Consular present, and Twelve
thousand Doll"
cash. - The copies of these accounts, and of Mr
Cathcarts communications, shall be forwarded to you by the nest
oppcrtunity. - Capt. Stewart was obliged to remain one day in port
to deliver the articles &$ and the next sailed with a fair wind to join
the Commodore. - He had a boisterous passage of 24 days from Leghorn and had not heard of the loss of the Pldadelphia before he
arrived here. - The broad cloths which he brought, as part of the
consular present, had received considerable damage on board the Brig;
the Bales having been wet with sea water in a gale of wind, which
obliged him to open them on board.
On the 27th of Novr I communicated to the Regency, the intention
of our Government to change the Mediterranean Passport, and fixed
the term of two years (of 12 lunar months each) for the full exchange;
and in the mean time either the new or old passport should be respected. - I have sent Dr Davis, a t Tunis, sixty Tops and one new
passport, with directions to make the like communications there. The cruizers of this Regency are stript and laid up for the winter.
Dmr 26th. The Minister of the Marine sent for me this morning. and
put into my hands the Inclosed Invoice of articles required by the Dey
from the United States on their next Annuity. - I received it, and
told him it should be forwarded; but gave him no assurances that it
would be fully compli'd with - The non arrival of the Annuities due
on the 5th of Septr last which were almost entirely of Timber &-c is
one principal cause of this heavy Invoice of other Articles a t this time;
for, he observes that vhen Invoices are given for Timber, plank, and
other wticles, the production of the U. States, they are neither not
sent forward; or it requires so many Vessels to bring them, that some
are lost on the way; and that he may, therefore, as well give orders for
articles more vnluable and less bulky. - I felt, a t this moment all the
evils, and disadvantages of our want of punctuallity in fulfillin,r~ our
Stipulations, and could not repel this exorbitant demand in the manner
I should otl~crwisehave done; and have, therefore, sent it as I received
i t ; but, in the mean time, I shall seek oppertunities to reduce it, and if
some part of each of the high Articles sh'J be sent, together ~ l t more

plank nnd Timber, of a good quality, and a quantity of small spars for
Top Mast, Top Gallant masts, and Steering sail booms - and stuff
for the handles of rammers, S p u n g ~ s& Laidles for cannon of different
calibers, from 4 8 to 6 pounders, they w? be received. - Should part
of the Cables & cordage be sent, it would perhaps be best to contract
with some hfcrchant in the U. S, engaged in the Baltic trade, to deliver
them here a t a fesed price.
There is a S ~ a n i s hPacket established between Allicant and this

Officer of the Bashaw and that the other held high rank in his troops.
And that the Tripoline soldiers belonged to the Gun boats were all of

her an was extremely active in taking the Officers out and carrying
them to the Bashaw of Tripoli, as well as plundering them of their

circumstances with officers, soldiers, Guns and other Property all

To the Eon. William Eustis, United States Congress, from Secretary of the Navy

The Secretary of the Navv informs Doct' Eustis, in addition to his
note of Saturday last, that by allowing full rations to all the Officers
of the Navy when they are on half pay, the annual additional Expence
to the Government would be about 18000 Doll" but if the allowance
of full rations should be confined to such sea officers as altho' on furlough shall not have permission to leave the Country, & whose professions do not supply them with the means of supporting tl~emselves
on shore, the annual additional Expence would then be $9,928 as nearly
as it can be estimated. Captains, Lieutenants and Midshipmen are
Officers of the description alluded to. I t is manifest that Officers of
these grades arc incapable of professional exertions on shore. When
officers are furloughed with permission to go to Sea on their own
private Affairs, half pay without rations is as much as they ought or
I believe do expect. Doctor Eustis will herewith receive arough draft
of a section which comprizes the ideas of the Secretary. MONDAY

Rough draft comprising ideas of Secretary of the Navy regarding pay and rations
of ofacers on furlough

That every Captain, Lieutenant and Midshipman who may not be
under, but may be subject to, orders for actual service, shall during
war a t present subsisting between the United States and the Bashaw of
Tripoli be entitled to receive their respective rations in addition to the
half pay prescribed by the Act providing for the Naval Peace Establishment: Provided that if any Captain Lieutenant or Miashipman
shall apply to the Secretary of the Navy for a furlough for the purpose
of prosecuting any voyage whatever in a Merchant Vessel or any
other private business and shall accordingly obtain a furlough for any
such private purpose no such officer shall be entitled to receive any
rations as aforesaid. [NDA. Cong. LB, Vol. 1, 179&1811.]

SIR, My unpleasant communication of the 17th ultimo, (which was

unfortunate event, has given not only the Bashaw; but all Barbary,
an influence over us, which no other possible circumstance could have
produced; the little National consequence, we possessed with this
Regency, is already materially effected by our recent misfortune. On the 14th instant, I was called to Bardo, by the Sapatapa, who
demanded an answer to the Bey's letter, directed to Commodore
Morris - (a Copy of which I have the honor to enclose You) I informed
him that no reply was yet received, and that it was not time to expect
one - He observed, that his Master would wait no longer, as he
was resolved to know whether we were in a state of peace or War - I
told him that no doubt could, or ought to exist in the breast of His
Excellency, of our good will & friendship towards him - "we
'Lshould be better satisfied to hear that, from Your Government,
"accompanied with such proofs as we expectn- I answered, that on

'(delay will be made by the Commodore; or does he intend to wait

"Embrolione? - it would be a different game from that You have
"played with Tripoly - uncl the loss of one frigate with us, could
"only be repaired by a Regalia of three" - Then turning to one of

[January 1804?]
Rules for government of U. S. Ships of War entering Algiers

OBSERVATIONS
for the Commander of an American Ship of War
coming to the Port of Algiers
1" On a Ship of war of the U. States coming in sight of Algiers,
the Consul must obtain the Defs permission to go off to her; without
which no Consul can go off. Said Vessel is to hoist her pendant &
Ensign ann fire a Gun to Leeward and then hoist the American Jack
a t tlw Fore top Gallant Mast head. - She is not to approach nearer
Algiers than 5 or 6 miles, until1 the Algerine Boat, with the Consular
flag, is coming off. 24 If there be no contagious disorder in Algiers, the Boat, with the
Consul, will go along side; but if any contagious disorder prevails,
she will drop astern and confer at a distance.
34 The Consul will have a detail of &flairs,or news ready written,
to give to the Commander; and the Commander will also give, in writing, all requisite information to the Consui. - By this means nothing
will be forgotten.
4'Q The Ship should take care to anchor before that, by light
winds, calms. or currents, she would be set within cannoli sbot of the
~lgerk~
e u t i e r i e sBut
; must new? anchor until visitted by the Consul
and is infornled by hi111 of the state of affairs between the U. States and
t,he Regrncy. st? Should the business of the Shiv require her anchoring: the best
placr will be to the S E by F of the ~ i ' g h thouse on the ~ n r & ,a little
to the east of the second Castle on the Southern shore: wbich is the
second Battery from the Cape North of the Metafour River Curayuh OBSERVE That to the North of Cape Met;lfour (the eastern Cape
forming the Bay of Algiers) there is a reef of Rocks, laying two miles
from the land - VVhen the wind is fresh from K. \IT.
Korth, K.E. or
East the sen breaks over this reef: - Tt should hare a good birth
coming in and going out of Algiers Bay.
All within Cape hletufour and Cape Coxines (the western Cape
forming the Bay of Alyiers) the current sets to the Westwad; and outside thls line it sets to the eastward, a t the rate of three miles per
hour. \Then you anchor in t.he Bay of Algiers, be always ready for action;
and always ready for getting under way. - Here are always sudden
Gales; and I mny add, you are never secure in your affairs. The whole crew of the Algerine boat which comes off with the Consul should not be permitted to go on board the Ship. - By t,heir
enquiries false news is often circulated, and representations made
rej judicial to your national affairs. - Communicate nothing to the
people who come on board; but treat them with c i d i f y and attentions.
When the ship anchors, she is saluted with 21 Guns, which she
must return. If she anchors, and is not saluted, it indicates that
your nation has a point to settle. - If the Ship salutes under Sail, it
will not be answered by Algiers; because it is not usansa, or custom. The Consul will inform the Commander when it is proper for him
to land. And when he does land, he will be saluted with Seven Guns,
which the Ship must return
After the Commander has landed, and has seen the General of
Marine & Admiral, he then proceeds to the Consular houst*; and if

306

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM IS03 TO 1804

requisite, visits the Dep at his Palace. - The Consul must first
obtain permission on this point through his Drogerman. The oars are always taken out of the Ships boat by the Algerines,
when they lnnd. - This is to prevent Slaves from making nn escape
with the boat. - When the boat is ready to return, the oars will be
delivered up. The next day a.fter tbe Ship anchors, it is customary for the Regency
to send a present to the Ship of BU~IOGI~S,
Sheep, Poultry, & on
receiving which, the Ship fires three Guns, and the Consul pays for
it 15 or 20 dollars. If tlle Commander, when on shore, should be visited b~ the different
Consuls, the Consul, with him, returns the visit; or if by necessity,
or accident, he does not return the visits, the Consul makes an
excuse. An Captives. or Turks, or Moors, or Jews, of Algiers, who should
illegn Iy grt on board the Ship, the Commnntler must report them to
the Consul, and he will endeavour to obt,ain pardon for them. At all
eaents they must be given up.
Twenty minutes beforr sun set, the Marine Gnte of the Citv is
shut. This excludes all interco~mebetween the Citv anti the Marine;
which is the o d v place, at which Boats are allowed t.o lnnd. - Core
should be taken that all persons who ought to be on board the Ship in
the night, should pass the Gate before this time. When the Ship is ready to depart the Consul gives the intimntion
thereof to the Dev, through the Drogermnn. - I t is cr~stomaryfor
the Dey (if he be in the City) to see the Comnmnder before his Departure. - On this visit he will say, - "Has Your Highness any
Commands? I am destined for Sea". When the Commander e,nters his boat, to Depnrt from Algiers, he
is saluted with Secen Guns, which the S h i p rn?r..d return. OBSERVE, t h a t Christinn Fridap is Turks Sunday. OBSERVE, only the Ports of Algiers, Bonn, & Oran, are p~rbiic
ports. The others should never be entered but by necessity, as the
Inhabitants are very sacage, and often commit outrages Bt arrests on
Officers and Crews of Boats.
When the Consul pocs off to a Ship his national flnq is displav* in
the fore part of the Bont, to denote the he (the Consul) 1s on board the
boat,. - N. B. The flag is not displny'd until the Bont passes the pier
head of the Marine; and on returning it is taken down a t the same
place. When an Embargo is laid on the Vessels in the Port of Algiers. on
account of the fitting out of their Cruizers, it docs not effect the Ships
of war, of other Nations which may come into the Bay.
Unless the U. States Vessels of War have some very particular
business, I would not recommend their Anchoring. - They had
bettor lay off $ on two or three days, to avoid the danger of Gales &
bad weather in the Winter Season, as well as the Caprice of the
Government. [LC. EPP. Vol. 9,Jan.-Feb. 1804.1

SIR, I have the honor to inform you of my departure with the
Convoy X ?2. from Gibmltar, on the night of the 24th October pursuant to your orders of the 18cQ[?]of that month. Our progress
was much retarded by contrary winds, untill the 31st, when we had
light airs from the Southu-ard and Westward. On that day, we made
Cape de Gatt, and passed the Britisl~Convoy under the Termagant.
Nothing of any importance occurred, untill the 4Q of November,
when the Termagant came up with us, and requested permission to
examine the papers of the Brig Fame from Batavia, alledging they
had received information of her having Dutch Property on board,
I brought the Fleet to, and granted them permission after examining
them myself, and finding they were perfectly clear.
On the gth, we were up with ?rlarceilles, but it blowing a Strong
Gale from the Westward, and the weather very thick, we dare not
make the land, untill the next day, when I dismissed the Vessels
bound there. The 12@ we arrived s t Leghorn, and landed M:
Cathcart a t the Lnzaretto. The 17th I obtained Prnttique, and
landed to expedite the business. On the 2Sth the money and other
articles were ready, but I was prevented bringing them on board,
untill the 26th in consequence of a severe Gale of Wind from the
Kestward. The 27th we sailed, and kept company with the United
States' Brig Arguc., untill the 29th a t hiidnight, a scvrre Gale of
Kind came on, with a tremendous Sea, that hove the Syren, on her
Beam Ends, and filled her waist full of 7Tater. X e got her before
the \Tirid, Knocked out some of the Ports, and freed her Decks.
The Jolly Boat was stove to Atoms, $ lost. Kothing but Strong
Gales from the Westward, with heavy Squalls (that prevented our
carrying any Sail, but Storm Stay sails) prevailed from the 2nd of
Decemher to the 12th; during which time, we were driven considerably
to the Eastward, and all my Officers Sick, but two young &- inex~erienced hlidshipmen: On the 21st we arrived a t Algiers, and delivered
the Articles to hlr Lear, Consul General. Xext day me sailed. The
26tQwe made Cape Bon, without having seen any Vessels on our
passage. Not having provisions to prosecute your orders farther,
we bore up for this place where we arrived on the evening of the 2Sth
Your orders of the 4t'! December I immediately commenced the
necessary repairs $ 9 that the Brig requires. She leaks very much
in her upper Works, which has damaged some of the provisions, and
other Articles. I am, therefore, under the necessity of caulking Her rigging we take this op ortunity of overhauling, and also to sliift
her hlnin Rlast further A t, which it requires, and feel confident
it will much improve her sailing. I left a t Leghorn Robert T. Spence

is a son of Al! Spence Purser of the Philadelphna.

2nd January 1804
SIR, I have just recd the afflictive information that an American
Ship of 44 Guns having been stranded in the Harbour of Tripoly, has
been compelled to surrender to the Gun Boats of the Dey by which
she was surrounded. This circumstance puts in the power of those
Barbarians 307 American Seamen and 26 Officers, the ship having been
fully manned. The War between Tripoly and the United States was
commenced by the Dey in direct breach of a solemn Trcaty and without the smallest pretence of ill faith or aggression on the part of the
United States. I cannot but hope sir that the humanity of the First
Consul will feel an interest in an event which affects so nearly the
happiness of so many Men; and that this circumstance connected with
the subsisting harmony between France and the United States will
induce him to interpose his good Offices with the Dey of Tripoly for
procuring them immediate relief. The First Consul has known how
to diminish the dread of the reat power which France has acquired
under his wise administration y embracing every occasion by rendering that power subservient to the interests of humanity. In soliciting
his mediation for the establishment of Peace between the United
States and Tripoly, and releasing from Slavery the unhappy Men I
have mentioned. I afford him a new means of extending to a distant
World that species of Glory, which is I am satisfied dearest to his heart.

Nor sir, will he want a direct cause for this interference founded on
the interest of France and Italy, which are deeply engaged in the uninterupted Commerce of the United States during a War in which
their view is arrested.
Should the First Consul sir, think this an object worthy hi attention, wo are content to place our Treaty on the old foundation on
receiving back our Citizens to which we are the more entitled, as in
all captures made by us upon Tripoly, we have returned immediately
the men found on board their Vessels.

you the 19th and 20th of last Month, and ordered Mr Pulis to hire
a vessel and send over for the purpose of carrying my letters, and
some articles which I supposed you might most want; and which I
directed Mr Higgins to purchase for yourself and Officers. I regret
to find that hlr Pulis has not yet sent a Vessel agreeable to nly orders.
To prevent any further disappointments I shall go to Malta tomorrow
to see my letters &c%hipped to you. I thank you for the information
your letters contain and shall profit by it. Col Lear has lodged I:31
[lo?] thousand dollars in Tunis for you to draw for, Your Bills on

that purpose, of course, i t will not be necessar-j- for you to draw any
more Bills on Leghorn or elsewhere a t a loss. I shall contrive to supply
you fully with every thing necessary. Write me what clothing will
be proper to send to the Officers & Men, and who I can send i t to with
safety and it shall be forwarded imniediatelg. Also what provisions
& Stores &c"ou wish to have sent you. I shall endeavour to take the
most effectual means for your release and am convinced Col Lear will
do the same. Our representations have long since gone forward to
our Government and we shall, no doubt, have answers to them by the
Congress, Essex & Boston by the last of March or early in April - I
lament most sincerely the situation of yourself & Officers, a sitmtion
which makes you and your friends unhappy, and deprives your
Country of your services. I have not the smallest doubt Government will take the most ready means of procuring your liberty I u7asoff Tripoly the 23rd Ulto. and in sight of the town I cn tured
a Vessel which left the Harbour in the Kight. She was under urk's
Colours and the Captain says belongs to the Captain Pacha and was
bound to Bengaza The papers will be translated in a day or two,
and if the Captain tells truth, I shall release her together with a
Turkish Officer and all the Crew which the Captain claims, amounting
in all to twelve. The remainder consisting of two Officers of rank
belonging to the Bashaw of Tripoly the son of one of the Officers
twelve Tripoline Soldiers and 42 Black Boys & Girls belonging to
Tripoly, and intended to be sold or given away I shall keep as prisoners; - This, the Turkish Officer agreeas to be just, and acknowledges

SIR. I am hond with your esteenwd favours of the 17'h and l g t @
Novemr - accompanied by sevcral communication from you to
Comodorc htorris, and from Mr Kiss? to you; the whole containing
many useful hints, and much valuable information; for which plcase
to accept my thanks. I approve your proposed plans of operations
against Tripoly, as they exactly coincide with mine. I had hopes of bringing that Rcgcncy to reasonable terms in the
spring, and effecting a solid pcace; but the loss of the Philadrlphia,
11:~smarred tliat prospect, and will probably protract the desirable
event to a longer period. Howcver, I shall make them feel the effcct of my remaining force,
and hope, soon to reduce the Bashaw's prcslmt dcmands, to something
reasonable.
I an1 told lie demands for Peace and ransom, three Rlillions of
Dollars, this is u pretty good asking price. I prrsume our Govcrnmerit will ncvcr accede to any thing estravaglmt, as we sliall by that
mcnns, hazard a War d l 1 all the Barbary powers, by sthi~ulating
tlwir avarice. 1 liave just rcturncd from a Cruise off Tripoli, where on the 23'd
Dcccmber I captured a Vcsscl \\-it11 the Bashaw's presents to tlie
Grand Seignior, accompanied by scvcral Tripolinc Officcrs of distinction. 1 trust tlJs Capture u-ill give us considerable advantages
in nc~g.otiatinga Pcnce. I \\-ish to procurc two or threc Gun Boats, and two hrortar Boats
with Guns, and 10 Inch hlortnrs compleat. Can you procure them
for me?
Where - Then and on what terms? Writc mc as soon as possible.
I also want one or two good Bombartlicrs, & will make tlieir pay
hantlsomc, if t h y understand tllcir business. Thcy can instruct our
young Officers in thnt branch of Gunnery, endearour to procurc one
for mr from Toulon; if you cannot short of thnt; A quantity of Shot
& Sliclls for the Artillery u-ill be wantcd. 1 liave made this port the

Altho' the fortune of War has made you prisoners to the Bashaw of
Tripoly, it has not made you his Slaves - Whether you will be Slaves
or Kot, depends on yourselres, Your determination not to work will be
proper, and if the Bushaw should attenipt compulsion by punishing
you for a refusal, I shall retaliate on l i s Subjects which 1 now have,
and which niay hereafter come into my posstssion. If you conduct
properly, you will in due time be redeemed and restored to your
friends, and entitled to receive full pay from the time of your capture
to your arrival in the United States. In the mean time every proper
means will be taken for c l o t l I ~ gand keeping you as comfortnblc as
circumstances will admit of, but should any of you voluntarily engage
your services to the Enemy, and afterwards fall into the hands of your
justly incensed Country Men you will undoubtedly suffer death
agreeable to the laws of the United States in such cases made and
proridcd. You ought not to let the threats of those, into wlmse hands
you have unfortunntcly fallen, intimidate you, but obstinutcly pcrsist
in your rights of bcing treated as prisoners and not as Slaves I sllall
write to the Bashaw inlnietliatc4y and acquaint him that all those
Americans who suffer tl~emselvesto be compellcd to worli for Iiini,
will be considered as having nliexmtcd tllemselvcs from the United
States, and of course our Governm! will not consider itself under any
obligations to ransom them. Behave like Amrricans btl firm and do

Barbary. HEALTH

It has pleased the almighty disposer of all sublunary events, t o
as pnsoners of war, the officers & crew of the
late belonging to the United States, but humanity
general usage of Nations, forbid your treating

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS

them as Slaves: and should you so treat them after the receipt of this,
you will be exerciseing your power against your interest; as I presume
the United States will only make provision for the ransom of then
Citizens who are considered as prisoners of war, and not for those
whoom you treat as Slaves, by compelling them to work for you
against their inclinntion. It is their duty to resist such compulsion
by refusing to work; and all those of our Citizens, who voluntarily
engage in Tour Service, should they ever fall into our hands, will (by
the laws of our Country) be considered as Traitors, and punished
with death. I therefore request that the unfortunate American
prisoners may not either be inticed or compelled to labour as Slaves,
but that they be treated with humanity.
On the 23'4 Citimo in sight of Tripoly, I captured a Vessel under
Turkish Colours, bound to Bengaza, with two Tripoiine Officers,
several tripoline Soldiers, and a number of Black men & women;
amounting in all to about Sixty on board; and brought her to this
place. She is now performing quarantine, and as soon as she is
ndmitted to prattique, I shall release the Vessel, together with d l the
people claimed by the Captain; consisting of an officer of the Captain
Pacha, four Turks, and seven Greeks and will give the Captain a passport and every assistance to prosecute his voyage to Constantinople,
whither he sap's he is bound, after he should have been a t Bengaza;
but the Tripoline Officers, Soldiers Br Black people I shall detain as
prisoners, and send them to America, unless you think proper according
to the custom of other Xations, and as humanity dictates, to enter
into a negotiation for an exchange of prisoners. I n the mean time
you may rest assured that your people are, and sljall continue to be,
well treated as prisoners of K a r , and not as Slaves. I have not
allowed a single article of cloathing, or anvthing else, to be talien
from them; and each one of them now has all the money u-11ich they
had when they came into my possession. I pray you to make known
all these matters to His Excellency the Bnshaw, and to write me an
answer to hlulta. I also want to know what the demand will be for
the ransom of such of the officers & crew as are considered and treated
as prisoners of war.
Accept my thanks for your kind attention to Captain Bainbridge
& his Officers, and be assured I shall when oppertlmity offers, give
you proofs of my satisfaction. M'ishing you health I have signed
this with my hand on board the United States Ship Constitution, in
the Harbour of Syracuse, the 4'4 day of January 1504.

my being made acquainted with before
I wrote you from Leghorn informine you of my arrival a t that place,
and my determination to leave there for Gibraltar as soon as possible,
and after experiencing several hard Gales of wind in the Gulf of Lyons,
and off Minorca and strong westerly winds from thence to Cape Pallos,
I found the Masts and Bow Sprit to complain, Owing to the Rigging
becoming Slack, in consequence of which 1 thought proper to run into
Carthegene to secure them - After remaining there three days and
having woulded the Masts, secured the Bow Sprit and set the Rigging
up, I sailed and beat down as far as Tangerole, the wind being ahead
and my water nearly Expended I came to an Anchor and filled some
of my R a t e r Casks, on my arrival a t Gihralter, after being from there
nearly Sixty days, without Communication a t any Port, they obliged
me to perform three days quarentine I am very sorry it is not in my power to give you the least information respecting the Emperor of 3lorocco or the state of his Cruizers,
owing to my long absence from hence and not having hear'd from hlr
Simpson since my arrival. - As soon as I can possibly fill my R a t e r

all be well, from thence to Cadiz, where most likely I s h a l remain ten

very safe lying a t Anchor. - I find the Argus to be an excellent Sea
Boat, and I believe when in trim will Sail very fast by the Wind. but
have not as yet had an oppertunity of Sailing with anything except
the Syren, nnd I believe Cap5 Stewart will be candid enough to

Twenty four hours after we had sent off the Prize under convoy of

the ship struck the ground, before the gunboats came out to nttaclr

TRIPOLIBARBARY
14 January 1804
SIR, NO doubt before this reaches you but what you will hear of
the unfortunate loss of the United States Frigate Phildelphia, under
my command, on Rocks off Tripoli: presuming that Comnlodore
Preble or Consul 0,Brien has communicated the particulars of that
accident makes me forbear detailing them: My feelings on that event
can better be concieved than described.
By late letters from Mr Davis, charge of Affairs at Tunis, I received
information of your being at Algiers in your functionary authority,
in consequence of which I take the liberty of stating the situation of
of our captivity.
The Officers, with a few servants to tend on them, are, and have
been, closely confined to the late American Consular House. The
remainder of the Crew are confined at nights in prison, and made to
work in the day; five of them have turned Mahoinetant.~,and probably many more will do the same. R e have been much necessited
for a Credit; which difficulty hlr Davis's l ~ s tletter has removed
be attended
by nuthorising the drawing of Bills on Tunis; but that \?-dl
with a loss of 25 p' cent, which can only be prevented by having money
sent to us.
I have been anxiously expecting to hear from Commodorc Preble,
and am at a loss to account for his silence, particularly as I stated
our wants, and informed him of the mode of communicating with
this placc. I was greatly in hopes that you mould have Yisitcd
Malta in the Constitution, and would have felt yourself at liberty to
enquire the demands of the Bashaw of this Regency. - I consider
the carlier that question is put, the sooner it will effect a negotiation;
as their demands, either for our ransom or peace, no doubt will a t
first be exccedingly exorbitant, and the system of these Barbarian

330

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1803 TO 1801

powers have always been to demand more than they will finally take,
and that kind of treating procrastinates negotiation; tlierefore, an
Overture being made this Winter to recieve their first demands,
probably would be attended in the summer with their ultin~atum;and
if the question is postponed until the summer, their ultimatum,
owing to the proceeding Autumn & Winter, may be prolonged a
twelve month.
I shall briefly give you my ideas on the situation of the United
States with this Xegency, and trust that you will do me the justice
to believe they are not influenced by my unfortunate captivity.
Nature has strongly guarded the Harbour of Tripoli by Hocks &
Shoals; - the Town is too well fortified for our shipping, by an
attack, to make an impression on it; - the coast is so situated as to
make the most vigdant blockade prove inadequate to prevent their
Cruisers going in and out of port; - the Country abounds with such
a plenty of provision that they are not in the least depending on
importation for subsistance: and the loss of their small Mercantile
trade can only effect a few Jews, by whom it is carried on, and whose
interest the Bashaw totally disregards; and the trade of those Jews
by the closest blockade can be but little injured whilst Tunis is a t
peace; as the Island of Zirbe in the Regency of Tunis, adjacent to the
boundary of Tripoli, would always be a port for the reception of goods
destined to this place, - which could be readily conveyed in small
boats along the shore, or brought on Camels, for a small expense; as
these animals are numerous here, land carriage is exceedingly cheap.
The Bashaw will never be forced to terms, without he considers
his own safety endangered; and he is only Vulnerable to the United
States one way; that is by eight or ten thousand men landing near
his Town, which in my Opinion would soon become an easy conquest.
This measure or money, are the alternatives. \it?lere is your predecessor, could he not visit Tripoli? His understanding the language
and custom of the country would be of great sen-ice in .negotiating.

Please to present my best respects to LMr"ear - I hope she finds

subsist between the French and the Regency, from the sentiments
which the Pacha has always express'd, and from the conduct always
used towards him, that the means prescribed you to make use of, will
not be fruitless.

DEARSIR I came here for the purpose of forwarding letters and

writing to the Warrant Officers, & Petty Officers & Crew of the Philadelphia, and to the Bashaw's Minister respecting them. I did not
think it necessary to say anything to the Commissioned Officers, nor
do I suppose that it is to any of the Warrant excepting some of the
Mechanics. If you think that either of th,: letters will have a tendency
to make the situation of the Officers and Crew more uncomfortable,
you may use your own discretion respecting the delivery, but I suspect they will not have a bad effect. Let me know precisely how you
are all treated, what distinction they make, and what they allow you.
Did they plunder your Watches - and take the money and other
articles from your Pockets? I want to know particulars. Has any
of your Officers lost a Gold Watch with three or four hands one of
which is broken? Tell L! Porter I found his Sword & Belt in bad
hands, and shall take care of it for him. Write me if you know anything of the T'essel or people which I captured off Tripoly the 23rd

Soldiers but the Turkish captain of this Vessel was active in boarding
the Philadelphia and plundering the Officers Give me a11 the information you can respecting the situation of the T . P. Pcrliaps in May or

SIR, The moment the First Consul returned, I laid before him the
letter you did me the honor to write me dated the ll* instant. He
was much hurt a t the loss the United States have experienced in the
roads of Tripoly. He has not examined whether (according to your
Excellency's remark) it particularly regards the States he Governs that
Peace should reign between the Regencies of Africa and the United

States: but although himself is engaged in a War that the ambition
and disloyalty of our enemies has rendered inevitable and necessary,
that which the United States have to support has more than once
excited his solicitude. His greatest pleasure would be, to be able to
effect or preserve the blessings of Peace in all civilized parts of the World
He holds a sincere attachment to the people & Government of America,
depending on a just return on their part. In short, his natural feelings excite compassion for the misfortune of your Country Men,
whom destiny and not want of Courage has deprived of their liberty,
but not of honor.
With these sentiments Sir, he has requested me to order the Commissary General of the Republic of Tripoly to put all in order, to
alleviate the situation of the American Prisoners and even obtain their
deliverance; a t the same time he will make known to the Bashaw the
ardent desire of the First Consul that a Peace solid and advantageous
to both parties map shortly put an end to the E a r which divides them.
May these means be attended with full success! The reason to hope
they map not be fruitless, is the good understanding and friendship
existing between the French Government and the Pacha Dey of
Tripoly, and the disposition and sentiments on which the First Consul has ever prided himself. As I suppose your Excellency intends
writing to the Commander of the Forces off Tripoly, I shall have the
honor of addressing the Instructions for the French Commissary to
him, to be formmled

PARIS17th January 1804.
SIR,Upon receiving advice of the Misfortune that had happened
to the Philadelphia, and a desire to render every possible aid to my
unfortunate fellow Citizens that were captured in her, induced me to
make immediate application to the first Consul for his aid in procuring
their relief; and his mediation in bringing about a Peace. He r e d
my application in the most friendly manner, as will appear by his
answer to my note [2 Janua 1, which with the note are enclosed for
your perusal. The Minister ns written on the subject in the strongest terms to the French Commissary a t Tripoly. recommending that
he may use every endeavour to procure the release of the prisoners
and every effort to bring about a Peace that he declares to the Pacha
the interest the First Consul talies in the restoration of Harmony
between the two Nations. The regard he has for the United States,
and his hope that the friendship the Pacha professes for him, will
induce him to offer ternls of accomodation Thinking the subject
sufficiently important to merit your immediate attention. I have
directed M' Appleton to send a dispatch Vessel with i t immediate1
to you. You will see the instructions safely delivered to the Frenc
Commissary a t Tripoly You have probably some powers and instructions from the Government on the subject of Peace, if the Pachn
should be disposed for it, or if you have not, M' Lear certainly will

being out of my department and being wholly uninformed as to the

doubt not that the Consul's recommendation will have much weight.

Vixen
Afulta Harbour January 17th 1804.
SIR, I have the honor to inform you that I came here in the Vixen
the 13tQInstant from Syracuse, where I left the Constitution making
some necessary repairs on the Bowsprit and overhauling and refitting
Rigging Q c V h e Bowsprit recd some damage in a heavy Gale of
Kind off Tripoly last month, but I shall make it do with what repairs
our Carpenters can give it. I think it will be well to send out a Spare
Bowsprit, and the necessary wood for a lower Mast as neither can
be rocured here and in the e v e ~ of
t losing either I should be obliged
to Lave this station and go to Toulon to replace it, which would to
me be a grievous and mortifj-ing circumstance. The co[a st of Tripoly is estremely dangerous a t this season of the year but could not
avoid paying it a visit, and on the morning of the 23'c Vlto I captured
a vessel in sight of Tripoly u-hich left that port in the K g h t bound to
Bengaza. She mas under Turkish colours,. and Kavigated by Turks
and Greeks, but had on board two Tripollne Officers of distinction,
a son of one of the Officers a number of Tripoline Soldiers, and 42
Black Men and Women Slaves belonging to the Bashaw and his
Subjects, and a small sum of about 1000 dollars in money, Tripoline
p p e r t y . M y object in coming over here was to attend to the Transation of the papers, to look out for some good Boats for light cruisers
and to forward some necessary supplies to our unfortunate Country
Men.
If I find on the translation of the papers that the Vessel is Turliish
property I shall release her together with all the people claimed by
the Captsin Viz. An Officer of the Captain Pacha three Turks and
seven Greeks the remainder amounting to about Sixty Tripdines
and Slaves belonging to the Bashaw and his Subjects I shag keep as
I'risoners
I have written to the Bashaw proposing an Exchange,
and hope this Capture will enable me to release some of our Country
Men, or a t any rate it will afford us considerable advantage in ally
negotiation for a ransom or peace. I have had indirect proposals
from the Bashaw for a peace. He is willing to restore the Frigate
Philadelphia if we will give him a Schooner and and he will give up
our Officers and Men for five hundred Doll. each. I believe that,
on these terms he would make peace but he demands an annual

1

338

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1805 TO 1804

stipend for keeping it, such as the Sweeds and Danes pay him amounting to [space] doll: pr Annum payable in [space] This we never ought
to accede to, as it would stimulate the avarice of the other Barbary
Powers and probably induce them to make K a r upon us. I am taking measures to procure two Mortar Boats, and three or four Gun
Boats, and hope as soon as the season becomes favorable to make
War upon Tripoly in a way that will lessen the Bashaw's demands. He seems already to be convinred that he has sometlling
to dread, or he u-ould not propose acceptingone hundred and f i f t ~
Thousand Doll: for what not long since he expected to receive Three
Millions. I shall return to Syracuse in three or four days, and shall
forward three setts of Dispatches hy diffr conveyances detailing all
the transactions of the Squadron since the 14tWecember, the day
on which the Nautilus sailed from Syracuse for Gibraltar with my
dispatches up to that date, by her I forwarded three setts of Dispatches and one set by the Traveller Store Ship, with all the particulars
of the loss of the Philadelphia and other occurrences. I gave one
set in charge of hl' Gadson who was directed to proceed to the United
States with them by the first Vessel fromGibraltar, one set directed
to Mr Gavino to forward to Cadiz to >.I:Yznardy, to forward by the
first Vessel from that Port, and two setts to hi! Gavino who was to
forward them by different conveyances. Of course it is hardly possible
but some of them must have reached you. I shall however briefly
stnte that in chace of a Tripoline she [E'hilarlelphia]ran on the rocks off
Tripoly the 1st h-ovember; that most of her Guns were thrown over
board; her Fore Mast cut away, and other measures adopted for
lightening her to endeavour to get her off but without effect, and
that after an attack of about 4 hours by the Gun Boats, she surrendered, and all the Oficers and Crew amounting to 307 Men were
made prisoners.
The Civil and Military Government of this Island have represented
to me by letters that a number of Bullocks u7ere purchased by them
at. Tripoly, and paid for previous to my declaring it in a stnte of Blockade, and requesting permission to bring their property out of that
Country, in consequence of which I have allou-ed them until the last
of February to bring them away stipulating however that the Vessels
should bring no other property away, and that they should proceed to
Tripoly in Ballast I hope you will approve of this indulgence, as the
season of the year is such, that i t is not prudent to keep so near the
Coast as to enable us closely to Blockade it. After February has
expired I shall be able t o cruise near the Coast, and no farther indulgence shall be granted to any Kation. The peculiar situation of this
property I hope will justify my acceding to the request
The Nautilus has not yet returned from Gibraltar. The S y e n returned to Syracuse the week before last from Algiers where she carried
the Mopey &c* from Leghorn. She has refitted her Rigging and to
improve her sailing her Main Mast has been removed farther aft. I
shall send her immediately on a cruise off Cape Bon, and to look into
Tunis occasionally to receive any interesting intelligence Dr Davis
may have to communicate The Enterprize returned to Syracuse the
29th Ulto from a cruise off Tripoly since which Lt Decatur has requested a survey on her, stating that her hull is in tco weak and
decayed a state to proceed to Sea in the Winter season I according1
ordered a survey by Ll Commandant Smith Ls Command' steward:

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS

339

Lf Dent, and two Carpenters who reported her rotten, and not sea
worthy for winter cruising of course she must lay by until the month
of April, this leaves me only the Syren and two Schooners as the Argus
has returned to Gibraltar after having convoyed Vessels to Leghorn,
and she must remain a t Gib! until relieved, which I hope will be soon
as she is the best Vessel in our service for cruising in these seas. She
sails wonderfully fast, has been tried with the Syren, and sails more
than a third faster and will certainly outsail the Vixen as much.
K e are much in want of an agent both here and a t Syracuse. Our
Consul Mr Pulis does not speak a word of English he speaks Maltese,
l
for an Agent to
and Italian, but still he may answer for C o ~ s u but
procure Articles wanted for the Squadron, negotiate Bills, &c%e will
not do. K e can have no communication but by a Linguist. he is
very inattentive to our concerns. I beg leave to recommend TTilliam
Higgins Esqr a Merchant in this place of respectability and influence,
attentive and attached to ourInterests and concerns, for an Agent here;
and George Dyson Esqr a hlerch' at Syracuse for our Agent there.
He is a Gentleman of respectability is very attentive, and is the only
person in the place proper for the appointment. I am under the
necessity of employing those two Gentlemen until I can li110w the
pleasure of the President J hope you will please to recommend them,
for I assure you we cannot have better Agents. I am induced to
recommend them from patriotic motives only.
The Bashaw of Tripoly's brother who is his declared Enemx is now
a t Alexandria, and has all t,he Arabs & a number of Mamelukes a t his
command, and wishes to march to the siege of Tripoly, but is destitute
of Money, Powder, or Field Artillery-. His consul has been with me
this morning for assistance. He wants 50 Barrels of Powder Six
Brass 4 & 6 Pounders and Eighty or Ninety thousand Dollars This
he thinks with our assistance by sea would put him in possession of
Tripoly ; and I am very certain that it would in less than two months.
He offers perpetual Peace as soon as he is in possession of the Government, to give us hostages &- if we chuse, allow us to hold the principal
Fort a t the entrance of the Harbour, or in fact to allow us to make our
own terms to release our Country Men, and all Christian Slaves in the
regency I wish earlier notice had been taken of this man and his
views. In fact I am astonished that the first or second Squadron did
not oblige the Bashaw of Tripoly to sign any treaty they pleased. I
hare less force than either with ten times the force to contend with.
The Tripolines by May will have 19 Gun Boats and unless we have
Boats to fight them in their own way we shall not be likely to succeed.
If you will allow me to expend One hundred Thousand Dollars in
such additional Naval force as I think proper, I will take Tripoly or
perish in the attempt. I am confident that i t may easily be destroyed
or talien in the summer with Gun Br. Mortar Boats protected by our
Cruisers.
N. B. I cannot but observe that the Officers of the C i d & Military
dept of this place have been extremely attentive to me, and have given
every assurance of being friendly disposed towards the United States.
Admiral Bickerton called on me this morning to assure me that the
conduct of Captains Gore and Sutton in giving protection to our
deserters met his disapprobation and that he had no doubt but Lord
Neilson would order them to be delivered up. That in future no such

Concerning the Polacre Paulina

The declaration of Daniel Charles Heath, acting lieutenant in the
navy of the United States, and late prize-master on board the
polacre Paulina, captured by Lieutenant Commandant Sterrett,
under the order of Commodore hforris, of the American
squadron in the Mediterranean, taken on oath before the
Committee of Claims, on the 31st January, A. D. 1804, viz
That the deponent was on board the Enterprise a t the time of the
capture of the said polacre P a d i n a , which took place off the island
of Malta; that thc prize was carried into the port of Vallette by Lieutenant Lswrcnce, who afterwards returned on board the Enterp.prise,
and the charge of the polacre was committed to the deponent, as
prize-master, on or about the 19th January, A. D. 1803. That on

342

the 29th of the same month, David Valenzin, and several other persons
captured on board the polacre, were put on board the Enterprise,
and sent to Tunis, as the deponent was informed; that the deponent
received orders from Lieutenant Commandant Sterrett, approved by
Commodore Morris, then a t Tunis, to deliver to the Bey of Tunis,
or his order, the greater part of the cargo of the polacre, as particularized in the said order. The residue of the cargo, which was said to
belong to David Valenzin, the deponent sold by the order of Commodore Morris. The sales were completed by the 9th June, 1803; the
gross amount of which being $2,665 70 reduced to American currency,
may be seen by the accounts of Joseph Pulis, Esq., American consul
a t Malta, and Mr. William Higgens, who had the management of
the sales of said cargo, and whose accounts of the sales are now before
the Committee of Claims; and the nett proceeds, after deducting some
charges and expenses, amount to two thousand one hundred and fortyfour dollars and eleven cents. From which sum the deponent paid
to Commodore Morris (as per receipt) five doubloons, and the balance,
estimated a t two thousand and sixty-four dollars and eleven cents,
was by the deponent deposited, with the approbation of the Secretary
of the Navy, in the bank of discount and deposite in this city, on the
17th December, 1803; that as the deponent was leaving this city, he
left his papers relative to the disposal of the cargo of the polacre Paulina
with Mr. Goldsborough, clerk in the Navy Department.
The raisins, figs, and cheese, which Mr. Pulis had the management
of the sale of, were in a perished and perishing state.
The part of the cargo that Mr. Higgens had the management of
the sale of, which was perished and in a perishing state, is particularized in a certificate given by Mr. George Pierce and Llr. Lure, which
the committee have an opportunity of seeing.
The deponent further saith that the proportion of Valenzin's
property in a perished and perishing condition was but small, not
exceeding, perhaps, four hundred dollars in value.

Apr1l21" 1804
SIR, I have the honor to inclose the report of the Committee of
claims to the House of Representatives and an Act of Congress
respecting David Valenzin, a principal owner of the cargo of the
Polacre P a d i n a , Cap$ Rndich, captured in January 1803 by Cap!
Sterritt of the United States schooner Enterprize wllich has beep a
subject of complaint by the Imperial Minister a t Madrid. The are
transmitted to you together with the inclosed documents from Fommodore Morris with a view to explain the particulars of the capture
and subsequent proceedings in relation to the pretended prize. These
are certainly marked with irregularities, which doubtless proceeded
more from mistaken conceptions of duty than from a disposition to
oppress the captured. I n the mean time. i t is hardly susceptible of a
question that Valenzin was a subject of Tripoli and as such his property liable to condemnation. I t is understood that no actual blockade
of Tripoli existed a t the time of capture, and theretore that, the vessel
was not forfeitnl~lebut entitled to freight. That the capture was
lawlul and justifiable is not doubtea, but what is to be regretted is the
misapprehension which induced the captors to expect an adjudication
a t Malta or Gibraltar and finally to send the papers and owner of part
of the cargo to the United States without the property. You may
therefore signify to the Iniperial Minister that the United States
having a particular interest in respecting and seeing respected the
neutral flag cannot but disnpprorc of whatever has happened in
derogation of its rights in this particular instance; that their Courts
of justice being distinguished for a liberal regard to the rights of
foreigners it is to be expected that the Imperial subjects will receive
adequate compensation for the wrongs comnlitted, on making a
proper application accompnnied with the necessary proofs; but that
if any peculinr circumstances should render the judicial remedy less
applicable or extensi~ethan may satisfy the claims of ample justice,
the Legislature will doubtless listen to their complaint with the same
favorable disposition by which they were led to pass the Act in
Valenzin's case.

SIR, The Imperial Polacre Paulina was captured by Lieut Sterett.
The particular circumstances relative to the capture and detention
of that Vessel, are as follows - on the lgtQof January 1803, he captured and brought into the Harbour of Malta the Imperial Polacre
Paulina, Lucca Radish Master; she was bound from Malta to the
Port of Tripoli laden with merchandize the property of Tripolitans,
and having the Subjects of the Bnshaw of Tripoli on board, one of

344

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1803 TO 1804

which was the principal of the Charter Party and Claimant of the
principal part of the Cargo. Lucca Radish, Master of said Polacre
took this cargo on board a t Malta well knowing the situation of
Tripoli with t.he United States. The Master of the Vessel that
brought this Cargo from Smyrna refused to proceed to Tripoli and
others were solicited to take it on board; none would venture but
Lucca Radish. Mr Pulis was ordered to obtain t,he oath of a Master
of a Merchant Vessel there who had refused to take the Cargo on
board "that he had refused to take i t on board because it was to be
carried to a blockaded port". I solicited Sir Alexander Ball Governor
of Malta to direct a Trial on the said Polacre. He assured me i t was
not in his power; the only alternative was to endeavour to have the
Validity of Capture investigated a t Gibraltar and ior that purpose
carried the papers first discovered, with Lucca Radish and the Boatswain, to answer the necessary Interrogatories, and that he might be
satisfied no illegal advantages were intended to be taken of him. His
Royal Highness the Duke of Kent then Governor of Gibraltar did not
think proper to let the Court of Admira!t4y take Cognizance of the
Affair. I was then compelled to send the papers with the Tripolitans
to America; it was also my intention to have sent Lucca Radish to
the United States if he would not consent to relinquish all claims to
freight and demurrage which I was induced to believe he was not
entitled to. This offer made by M' S t a e t t to him and the Imperial
Consul a t Gibraltar at my request and in my presence. I sent Lieu'
Sterett with the papers and vouchers found on board of her and a t
the same time, I sent by Caps Barron my correspondence with Sir
Alex! Ball and the Imperial Consul a t Malta on the subject of the
Capture. My principal object in sending M r Sterett to the United
States was that a full and perfect report might be made to the Secretary of the Navy relative to the capture and detention of that vessel.
On the 1" July hearing that Lucca Radish was a t Malta, I wrote hl'
Pulis a letter specifying the particular Terms upon which he would
be justified in giving Lucca Radish the possession of the Polacre; of
which letter the enclosed is a Copy. Those terms were complied
with and Lucca Radish took possession of that vessel. I know of no
irregularities that, may have taken place in relation to that vessel, and
consequently can say nothing on that subject. I do not recollect
any other offers having bean made to Radish concerning that vessel
except those already stated. Rg V. MORRIS[NA. SDA.

Hon. ROBERT
SMITH.
On the 15th January, 1803, Lieutenant Sterrett received the enclosed orders to cruise. On the 17th he boarded and brought in for
trial the imperial polacre brig, bound from Malta to Tripoli, laden
with merchandise, the property of Tripolines, and having on board the
subjects of the Bashaw of Tripoli, one of whom was the principal of
the charter-party and claimant of the principal part of the cargo.
Lucca Radishjz, the master of the said brig, took this cargo in a t the
port of hialta, well knowing the relative situation of Tripoli with the
United States. The master of the vessel that brought this cargo from
Smyrna refused to proceed to Tripoli, and others were solicited to take
it on board. None would venture but Lucca Radishjz. hlr. Pulis
was ordered to take the oath of a master of a merchant ship to that
effect. I solicited Sir Alexander Ball to grant a trial on the said
polacre. He assured me that it was not in his power. My ordy alternative was to endeavor to have the validity of the capture investigated
at Gibraltar; and for that purpose carried the papers first discovered,
with Lucca Radishjz, the master, and the boatswain, to answer the
necessary interrogations, and that he might be satisfied that there
were no illegal advantages taken of him. His Royal Highness the
Duke of Kent, then the Governor of Gibraltar, did not think proper
to let the court of admiralty take cognizance of the affair. I was then
compelled to send the papers, with the Tripolines, to America. I t
was also my intention to have sent Lucca Radishjz to the United
States, if he would not consent to relin uish all claims to freight and
demurrage, which I was induced to be ieve he was not entitled to.
This offer Mr. Sterrett made him, at my request. He absconded from
the United States' ship Chesapeake, and refused the offer made to him
and the imperial consul at Gibraltar. My correspondence with Sir
Alexander Ball was perfectly satisfactory respecting the distance the
polacre was taken from the land. Mr. Heath was prize-master, and
can give every information of the pretended insult made to the imperial
flag, and the treatment of the crew. The petitioner, David Valenzin,
is the person alluded to as being the principal in the charterand
a subject of the Bashaw of Tripoli. Both can be proved %arty,
y papers

P

which were discovered on board the vessel detained by Lieutenant
Sterrett, and were put in his possession when he left the Mediterranean,
in the Chesapeake frigate, for America. The contract of the charterparty was in the name of Lucca Radishjz, the master of the imperial
brig, on the one part, and David Valenzin on the other part, as principal owner of the cargo. As a proof that David Valenzin is a subject
of Tripoli, a regular attested certificate from the British consul to that
effect was discovered among the secreted papers; and, as a further
proof, Mr. Cathcart h e w him in Tripoli as a broker, and his father as
a merchant in the city of Tripoli, and always considered him a Tripoline. His servant has also declared him a Tripoline, as well as himself.

detection; i t is near three months since the distressing event, and as

not communicating, for I cannot think that my unfortunate situation
has changed that regard which you professed; but situated as I am
you may naturally suppose the great desire I must have to hear

who is the proper Representative of my Country for me to address.
It is unnecessary for me to make a repetition of the late unfortunate

I n my former letters I mentioned, when you appeared off here,
by hoisting a White Flag and firing o gun to call attention, and if
a White Flag in answer was hoisted by the Bashaw, you may send a
boat on shore with safety.
We have been much necessited for a Credit, - which difficulty is
removed by Mc Davis's, charge of Affairs, letters, by authorising my
drawing on him, but the exchange is 25 pr cent against us on Tunis,
which is the only place we can get money for: this great loss can only be
prevented by having money sent us from Malta.
In one of my letters I suggested the idea of destroying the Frigate
(which lies in the harbour); - I think it very practicable by sending
a few boats prepared with combustable to bum her; the Gun-boats
are hauled up, and was a Vessel only to make the Town of Tripoli about
sun-set so as to prevent her being seen from the shore, and then stand
in for the Town, her boats might get into the harbour unnoticed;
no person, or very few, ever stays on board the Frigate; and the Gunboats could not be launched before the service would be performed.
If it is attempted, it should be done this Winter, and the first night
that the vessel comes off, to take them unawares, for it could not
be effected when they were prepared; - the wind in the night is
generally off the land.
I hope soon to see you off here to nsk the demands of the Bashaw,
for the sooner thnt questior~is put, I concieve the better. If Consul
0,Brien could be prevailed on to come here to assist you in negotiating,
he would be very serviceable by speaking the language and knowing
tlle Customs of the Country.
Pray inform me what advance I am to make to the Officers. Fire of the Crew have turned Turks, and two have died - our number
is a t present three hundred.
I beg the favor of your sending us American News papers when
opportunity offers.

considerations or annual Stipend or Tribute, and give us the Frigate
for a Schooner. These terms will be thought favorable by the United
States. I shall send a vessel to Col: Lear to consult him, and in the

informing me of the loss of the United States Frigate the Philadelphia

for $4000 with orders to draw upon Mr Frederick Degen of Knples
or myself for the ammount, provided hlr William Higgins of Malta
did not forward to him three thousand dollars in cash he hating
receiv'd my orders to thnt effect. In six weeks will be finish'd & ready to embark, wearing appare!
for the crew as pr the enclosed invoice & for the Officers I shall send
such articles as will serve their present nccessitps, which t h ~ ycan
have made in Tripoli to their own liking much better than I cnn suit
them by making them here, should Comodore Prebble be upon your
coast I request you to inform him that it will be necessary for one of
the small vessels to come to Leghorn for the above cloathing as nothing
is permited to be embark'd from this place for Malta except in vessels
of War, from Malta, the[y] can be sent to Tripoli under a neutral flag
or landed under the sanction of a Flag of truce which ever the Comodore may conceive most expedient. The cash for which I hare forwarded a credit you will (in conjunction with Mr Kissen) please to h8.x-e &stributed to the Officers
& crew from time to time until government makes provision for them,
as I have no orders whatever on that subject & forward these supplies
of my own accord from motives of humanity not doubting but theb]
will be of infinite service to the Unfortunate sufferers, who may depend
that I will do every thing in my power to alleviate their sufferings
consistant with the honor of our nation & dignity of our flag. The deplorable event of losing the Philadelphia & captivity of her
Officers & crew envolves incalculable consequences and changes our
position not only with Tripoli but the whole of the Barbary States;
~t is reported here that a treaty has been enter'd into between the
United States & the Regency of Tripoli in consequence of the former

354

promising to pap the latter the sum of 450,000 dollars, & a considerable annuity, which I presume is false, as none of our Officers in this
sea has power delegated to them to such extent, & i t is not very
probable that they would commit themselves by making unauthorized agreements which they must be sensible would envolve such
national consequences, that government would never ratify them;
what ever may be the intentions of government the idea that the
United States will ever conclude a peace with Tripoli upon dishonorable terms ought to be treated with contempt, this is the only
means to induce the Bashaw to moderate his terms & to prevent the
other Regencys from breaking with us; I have been eleven years in
captivitp myself & yet I solemnly declare that before I would see my
Country obliged to accede to all the impositions which will be the
consequence of concluding a precipitate peace with Tripoli that I
would suffer to undergo as long a captivity again & would glory in
my chains. It is likewise reported that the Moors hare pot the Frigate off the
bank & are fit in^ her out for sea. if true (which I doubt verv much)
I think their is lprobability that ~ o m o d o r ePrebble will Fivk e good
acct of her if he should be so fortunate as to encounter her out of gunshot of the Fortifications. Their has been so matiy reports circulated by the Jews of Barbary
& others relative to your misfortune; manifestly calculated to lessen
our importance as a nation Bt sully our maratirne reputation, that I
conceive it necessary to contradict them in the most pointed manner;
as soon as I am inform'd of the particulars, which I request you to
communicate to me as soon as possible; with the number of liill'd $
wounded on both sides & such other minuti2 as will tend to counteract the malice of our enemies. I likewise request you to give me every information in your power
relative to the Bashaw's sentiments on this change of position, & what
are his pretensions in consequence thereof, & whether you suppose
the prisoners can be redeem'd independant of entering into Treaty
with him. Enclosed is a letter from our friend M' Anthony Dugan which I
believe encloses letters from home, I request you & your Officers to
make use of my services without reserve & to believe that while I
lament your unfortunate situation that I would take a singular
pleasure in alleviating your sufferings and making them as supportable
as possible. [LC. EPP, Vol. 9, Jan.-Feb. 1804.1

and to return with such Vessels, as were at that port ready for sea,
and wished the benefit of Convoy down,
After performing a short Quarantine a t Gibralter, and taking on
board what provisions, Water, and other stores, was Necessary I sailed
on the 18'@ for Tangier, where I arrived after a passage of four hours,
and am happy to inform you, that every thing remains peaceable at
that place, and that nothing has happened worth hotice, since
Commodore Preble left this Station,
The Emperors ships are all dismantled, and laid up a t Sallee, and
Larash, and no attempt has been made, to Equip any of them for sea,
in the absence of the Squadron.
I remained one night in Tangier, and sailed with an intent to go
direct to Cadiz, but t,he uind Shifting sudden to the Westward, and
the Weather being very bad, was obliged to return to Gibralter, and

I received in due time your letter of the 7th of September, repeating the request of a Frigate of 36 Guns with which on a former occasion I had informed you that circumstances did not permit us to
comply. I am under the necessity of stating, that. these circumstances contunue, and that our Naval force being only proportioned
to our exigencies, we cannot with Prudence lessen it, by parting
with any portion of it. I should regret much a misconception of
our Motives on this occasion. We set a just value on your friendship, as we do on that of all other Nations with which we have
intercourse; and as we presume those Kations do on ours. These
mutual friendships, and the interests arising out of them, are equivai m t s the one for the other, and authorize equal expectations, equal
claims, and rights on both sides. Of our disposition towards yourself in particular, we have not been wanting in Proofs, in addition to
the faithful fulfilment of our Treaty: nor shall we on proper occasions
fail to continue reasonable manifestations of them according to the
rules we observe in our intercourse with Nations

Such being our regard for you, it is with peculiar concern I learn
from your letter of September 14 that Mr Cathcart, whom I had
chosen to succeed the place of hJr Eaton near you, and chosen from a
confidence in his integrity, experience, and good dispositions, has so
conducted himself as to incur your displeasure I n doing this, be
assured, he has gone against the letter and spirit of his instructions,
which were, that his deportment should be such, as to make [merit?]
my esteem and respect for your character, both persona1 and Public
and to cultivate your friendship by all the attentions and services he
could render. So soon as he went out of this line, he was out of the
line of his duty, and his acts are disclaimed as in opposition to his
orders. On his return to the United States, he will be made sensible
how far in this he departed from the intentions of his employers. The
consideration that the bands of Peace between Nations ought not to
be burst asunder by the hasty and unauthorised acts of a Public Agent
was worthy of your wisdom and Justice; and the acquiescence in the
transaction of our affairs by Mr Davis until an Agent could be sent
with formal authorities manifested a desire of maintaining a good
understanding, which being reciprocal is auspicious to our Peace. I n
selecting another character to take the place of Mr Cathcart, I shall
take care to fix on one who, I hope will better fulfil the duties of
respect and esteem for you; and who, in so doing only, will be the
faithful representative and organ of my earnest desire that the Peace
and friendship so happily subsisting between our countries may be
firm and permanent, and I pray God, Great and good Friend that he
may have you under his holy keeping.

out - he appear'd somewhat surprised, observing that lie thought

out a Quart 2*iy I n pursuance of your directions, soon after we left Leghorn,
I presented the Shipping Articles to Wm Kelly, a Seaman taken on
board a t Gibralter, for his Signature - which after reading to him,
and informing him that I was directed to furnish him with such
Cloaths as he wanted, he was about to sign - when Mr Harrison
they laying in his Birth observed to Kelly, that he was a damned

said he would not sign the Articles.

Court of Enquiry into Conduct of Purser Nathan Baker, U. S. Navy

Statement of evidence appearing to the Court of enquiry held on
board the Syren Brig on the Official conduct of Mr Baker Purser of
the said Brig. The mRsT charge agt Mr Baker is that he had ordered a quart of rum
to be stopped from the daily allowance of the crew, & that this had
continued 20 days. Mr CALDWELL
states that he knew nothing of an order being given
to the Purser's Stewd to stop one quart of rum from the daily allowance
of the crew untill lately; that then Carter (the PQte) u-as called into
the cabin, in consequence of a report to that effect from severnl of the
Officers, & said he had stopped one qut of rum for twenty days by the
order of h4! Baker, which Mr Baker acknowledged.
QUES. DO you know whcther the measures were too great, so as
to cause a stoppage of thc daily allowance? ANS. I do know that the
gill measure was too great, or bore an over proportion to the other
measures on board.
Mr CALDWELL
further stated that there had been frequently a
deficiency in serving out grog without the cause being known - &
that Carter had stopped a quart & said Mr Baker enquired whether
that would be sufficient, to which Carter replied it would.
CHARLES
B. CARTERstates that he had orerdraum n $4 pint of rum
for three or four days on account of two men leaving the ship That
some time after this M? Balier ordered him to stop a qut a day from
the allownnce $ continue it untill further orders. He did so, untili
the people complained to Mr Harrison of tllcir grog being too weak, &
then he drew the full allowance, but with Mr Baker's knowledge; and
that i t was three weeks during which this stoppage continued.

364

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1805 TO 1804

QUES. Did you know of any inaccuracies in the measures? ANS.
The gill & half-pint overrun the gallon, or did'nt correspond with it.
after drawing the full allowance by the Gallon measure, I was often
obliged to get more rum out, to make up the deficiency of grog caused
by this difference in the measures.
QUES. Did 317 Baker state to you that this inaccuracv in the
measures was his reason for ordering the stoppage of one quart per
d a ~ ?ANS. He did not. QUES. Have you hnd any dispute with his Baker since you have
ANS. I hare. h

QUES. What time was i t when you discovered the inaccuracies in
the measures? AN&I t was after the stoppage of a quart per day had
ceased - I tried the measures with each other, & found that the gill
5 p! did'nt correspond with the gnlIon, but all the other measures did.
QUES. When was i t that 115 Baker gave you the order to stop the
qur? A m . TWOor three dogs after lea~ingthe Capes of the Delaware, or the 3d or 4!? Septr
M: HARRISON
states that the C a p b f the Fore castle complained to
him that their grog was too weak; and that he had heard Mr Baker
acknowledge that he had ordered a qut to be stopped from the daily
allowance. JAMESKELSO(S~CW-*'~
Alate) says, that a quart pr day had been
stopped for a fortnight or longer, and that Carter said it was by hi'
Baker's order & in consequence of too much being drawn before.
QUES. Do you remember that it was necessary to get more rum up
in consequence of the grog not holding out? A m . Yes; I remember
it happened twice that we had to get more rum up; but I don't h o w
for what cause. C R STEWART

charge against Mr Baker; Viz. That he had charged the
E a r d room mess with 60 Ib. beef illegally. L I E CHOWARD
~
Says that a mess book was kept in the IT$ Room of
the provision drawn from the ship; that st one time there was n charge
of 60 lb of beef, which it appeared to him could not have possibly
been used. Some time afterwards in an altercation among the Of%cers of their mess, M! Baker said a barrel of beef had been opened for
the use of the u-ard-room, & that 50 or 60 Ib were missing out of it, &
that he concieved i t was hard he should loose i t ; urging this as a reason
for his charging the ward room mess with the above meat.
QUES. At what time did this altercation take place? ANS. I don't
remember certainly - but about the last of Sept or begining of Octob.
I believe.
QUES. HOWmuch do you think your mess was overcharged?
ANS. I think it was overcharged about 40 or 50 Ib. QUES. By whom was this charge made? ANS. M' Baker made the
charge & sent for the Ship's s t e d to prove the propriety of it a t the
time of the altercation aforesaid.
QUES. Did your mess draw your provision regularly, & in what
quantities generally? ANS. We drew our provision as we wanted it;
e
of the regular
and tbis charge of 60 Ib was an extra ~ h a r g independent
charges agt the mess.
QUES. Is this the A/C. (Nq 1) alluded to? A N S . I believe it is, to
the best of my remembrance.

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS

365

QUES. 'ill10 drew provision for your mess, & by what authority was
it dmwn? ANS. It was drawn by the Boy, generally by the verbal
order of some one of the mess. CIXARLES
R. CARTERwas asked whether there was not a Barrel of
Beef kept open for the use of the W-QRoom, from which beef was taken
without its being weighed or any notice taken thereof. ANS. I know
nothing of R. Bar! of beef opened for that purpose or used in that way;
but I know of six pieces which were brought to the harness Tub a t
one time for the use of the Ward-room, & which weighed about 50 or
60 lb to the best of my knowledge. These pieces were not used by
the Ward-room, but served out to the crew.
QUES. Did you not weigh the remains of a barrel of beef by M:
Baker's direction, from which you had never used?
ANS. I did, but a m not certain as to the weight.
QUES. Did ou not hear Mr B ~ k e say
r he would deduct 50 1b from
what he had c ~arged? ANS. 1 did. JAMES
KELSOsays that he knew nothing of a barrel of beef kept open
for the use of the W room: but he knew of five pieces brought to the
harness Tub a t one time, for the use of the ward-room, u i t h a mark
on them.
QUES. DO you know whether they were used by the R-c' Room?
ANS. They were; I kept the key of the harness Tub, & they were used
sooner or later by the Ward-Room. JNQ
REEDYsaid he knew of a bar! of beef ordered to be kept for the
use of the W-Room by Mr Carter, before the arrival a t Gibraltar;
That to the best of his knowledge 30 or 40 lbs were used out of it, &
that the remainder was served out to the Crew by the order of the
Ship's Stew$.
QUES. T e r e these 30 or 40 lb drawn a t different times or together?
ANS. They were dmwn a t different times.
QUES. DO you know of five or six peices taken out of this barrel1 &:
sent to the harness Tub a t one time? ANS. I do, five or six peices
were taken out by the order of hIr Carter R- sent to the harness Tub.
Qn~sU
. h a t time elapsed between opening this B.1. Rr serving i t out
to the ships crew? ANS. I don't know certainly but I suppose about
a week or a fortnight. Mr HARRISON
says that a b.11. of beef was reserved for the use of
the Ward-room, but not being better than the other beef in the ship,
it was afterwards served out in common.
QUES. HOWmuch was used out of it, before i t was served out?
ANS. I can't say certainly, but I suppose about teu or twelve pounds.
Mr MAXWELL
states that Mr Baker presented an A/c. to the mess
wherein was R. chargeof 60 lb of beef. -4t the same time Mr B. acknowledged he did'nt think the mess could have used so much; but as the
b.11 was opened for their use as he understood, and there being a deficiency of 60 lb or more, he thought he ought not to loose it. After
some nltercation h4r B. agreed that 10 1b should be inserted instead of
60 lb. - Mr Maxwell further said he knew nothing of a b.ll of beef
reserved for the use of the Wq-Room until1 that night.
Doc$ MARSHALL
Said that some time in Octob. he was appointed
to settle the mess A/C. a statement of which was furnished by M r
Baker, in which was a charge of 60 lb. & several others a t yery short
dates interveening. Upon refering to the Mess, they all exclaimed
ngainst the exorbitancy of this charge of 60 lb. Mr Baker himself

7

366

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1803 TO 1804

acknowledged that they could not have used as much, but that a
considerable quantity had been lost out of a bar! which he understood
was opened for the mess, he thought they ought to bear the loss, as
he could'nt afford it himself. CHS.STEWARTPredJ Court
W. LEWIS J q e A d v !

A statement of facts arising out of the evidence produced to the
Court of enquiry on the Official conduct of M: Baker, Purser of
the Syren Brig. It appears, as to the FIRST charge, viz. That a quart of rum per
day had been stopped from the allowance of the crew for a considerable
time, by the order of ,llr Baker; that the fact is, some rum had been
stopped with the knodedge of Mr Baker, in order to make up for
an inaccuracy in the measures, too much rum having been previously
served out; but that no particular order had been given to stop any
specific quantity; the thing being left in a great measure to the discretion of the steward: And i t does not appear that Mr Baker's
object was to defraud the crew, or benefit himself; for by the returns
of provisions, the Rum has fallen short a considerable quantity 150 or 160 gallons. -4s to the 2Vd charge viz. That Mr Baker had charged the Wardroom mess uith 60 1b beef illegally: it is the fact that a Barrel of
beef had been opened for the use of the Ward-room, from which five
or six pieces, weighing 60 or 70 !b, were taken & used for the Wardroom Mess; and afterwards, when this beef was found to be of no
better quality than that used by the crew in common, the remainder
was served out by the ship's Steward; and therefore it appears that
the charge of 60 Ibs in Mr Baker's A/C. is correct.

SIR, From the Statement of facts arising from the examination .of
the evidence produced a t the Court of Enquiry respecting the official
conduct of Mr Nathan Baker Purser of the U. S. Brig Syren, I concieve
that the charges brot against him by LC Maxwell and Doctor Marshall
t,o be without the least foundation and that they must have originated
from motives by no means honorable to those gentlemen: It is to
be regretted that the time and attention of a number of respectable
officers of the Squadron Should a t any time be taken up for the purpose
of investigating charges bro't against any gentleman from motives
of private picque: The conduct of M' Baker I conceive has been
very proper and that he has not intended to defraud either the Government of the United States, or the officers or crew of the Syren, but
that he has paid a laudable attention to his duty. You will therefore
take off the arrest and direct him to return to the duties of his office.

AMERICAN
CONSULATE
London - Jarwary t Y t Q 1804. SIR. I have had the honor to receire your circular letter of October
I s &u1it.h the remarks of the Comptroller of the Treasury respecting
- --sales
.
of. - American registered Vessels to which proper attention
the
sliall be paid. By my letter of Novr 10tQ(KP27) - I transmitted the Documents
required by yours of April 4@ and referred to in this last Circular. I have found the Powers vested in the Consuls by the late Acts and
Instructions extremely useful in preventing rarious irregularities both
in the Transfers of Vessels, and the treatment of Seamen, to render
their effect more complete by insuring the deposit of the Ships Papers
and preventing the possibility of any British Vessel using American
Papers, forged or otherwise obtained I have thought it expedient to
apply for a regulation to be made b this Government prohibiting
the Entry or Clearance of any Vessel c aiming to be American without
permission previously obtained from this Office; - I inclose my letter
to Mr Munroe upon this Subject; the application has been delayed
by unavoidable Circumstances there can be no doubt however
but that the Accommodation will be readily conceded. Tho a p e a t deal has been done to purify the ownership of American
Vessels perhaps something is yet necessary to accomplish this desirable Object and which Congress may hereafter see fit to regulate;
there is the best reason to believe that many Vessels under our Flag
are partly owned by Merchants in this City; I would suggest also
whether during the time of European War i t might not be desirable
to establish some Mode of verifying the character of the Car oes of
American Vessels, whether the Sea letter ought not to be de%vered

9

368

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1803 TO 180L

up on the termination of the single Voyage for which it is granted, or
a suitable endorsement made to prevent the possibility of its being
misapplied in the manner suggested in a former letter, whether the
Bills of Lading ought not in all Cases to be sworn to by the Shipper
before the Consul or Collector and made distinctly to express the
account for which the Vessel is freighted.
I am aware of the delicacy of t l m subject & the Objections which
must arise in favor of the carrying-Trade to such regulations, 'tho I
cannot conceive that the fair carrying trade woud in fact be injured;
but inasmuch as it might be in'ured the substnntial capital Trade of
our Country woud be strengt lened. I t has been strongly urged
against the establishment of the principle in the law of Nations that
"Xeutral Bottoms make free Cargoes" the great encouragement
which such a rule would offer to the carrying trade a t the espence of
the Capitd Trade of the United States; the Objection may be supposed to have more force as i t comes principally from a quarter where
interest u-oud seem to lead to an entension of ye carrying trade - If
then it was desirable to sacrifice a principle of Public Law for the
support of which some have thought the honor of every independent
Kation to be pledged, for the purpose of encouraging the Capital
Trade of our Country, it is to be hoped that no substantial Objections
can be made to such regulations as are calculated only to repress the
dishonest and irregular practices of the Carrying Trade; Perhaps the
only evil of regulations calculated to define the Bonn fide property
on board American Vessels, would be, the admission which they would
seem to make of the Right of Belligerents to seize Enemies property
on board Keutrul Vessels. I have been prompted to these remarks a t this moment by a Transaction which has lately fallen under my Observation and which I
took some pains to investigate. - The Owner of an American Vessel
lying in this port left a Power of Attorney with a London hierchant
enablmg him to freight, charter, or sell her: The hlerchant freighted
her with Goods for the Coast of South America, and put a Supercargo
on board who assumed the Character of an American Citizen, & who
was to appear to be the owner of the Cargo; the Supercargo had
served an apprenticeship in Boston, but it happened to my knowledge
was not a Citizen of the United States; they applied however for a
Certificate which I refused of course; he probably obtained a Document of some sort, for the Merchant was satisfied that he would
answer his purpose as an American: as I also knew that the Young
Man had neither Property or Credit sufficient to procure this Cargo
I questioned the Merchant upon this Subject, who candidly confessed
that the Cargo belonged to liimself and friends.
I was disposed therefore to retain the Ships Papers 'till I had compelled them to name in the Bills of lading the true account for which
the Property was shipped: Upon more mature consideration horn-ever
seeing that I had no specific Authority, I doubted of my controul
over the subject, and how far my view of it nught coincide with that
of Government; therefore concluded by only insisting that the Su ercargo shoud not be named an "American Citizen" in any Bil of
lading signed by the Master; this point was conceded and the Ship
Proceeded on her Voya,we. I have entered into this detail to shew the nature of the Trade
which may be carried on from hence to which I mean to apply the

something serious. We are left in the field of conjecture as to the
cause of their departure, without enforcing their points. The heroic
character of the Commander forbids the idea of fear: and whether the
fleet mas called away by information from Toulon (as another Ship
joined them on the evening of their departure) or from some other
cause, we have yet to learn. I think the measures you have taken to supply the wants of our
unfortunate Countrymen a t Tripoli, are proper. I will endeavour to
make some arrangement for your drawing on Leghorn in future. In

de Talleyrand-PBrigord, French Minister of Foreign Affairs, Paris
[Translation]

PARIB,
10 Pluz~iose,17ear XI1
The Minister of Foreign Affairs
to Mr. Livingston, Minister Plenipotentiary of the United States.
SIR,A declaration by Commodore Preble, commander of the naval
forces of the United States in the Mediterranean, announced last
December to the constituted authorities of Marseilles that he had
blockaded the Port of Tripoli and the adjacent coast and that neutral
vessels which should attempt to enter Tripoli or which should be
encountered off the neighoring coast, would be halted by the squadron
by his orders and taken to a port to be adjudicated.
Although recognizing the privileges and practices of which two
belligerent powers can avail themselves, practices according to which
a neutral vessel is excluded from a port actually blockaded, I cannot
refrain from observing that Commodore Preble appears to have, in
this instance, stretched the application of these rights in a manner
which tends to injure neutral commerce without being justified by the
rules generally adopted in the maritime neutrality conventions.
I n order to determine what constitutes a blockaded port, that
designation should apply only to a port that is attacked by a number
of vessels proportional to the force of the place, and urhich are near
enough that there is an obvious danger that the port will be entered.
I t is on this principle that the various conventions, which define
what is meant by the blockade of a place are based.
Therefore, i t was not sufficient for the American Commodore to
make a single frigate cruise off Tripoli, in order to authorize him to
declare that port and the adjacent coast under blockade. I t must
also be mentioned that the coast of a countxy has never been included
in the blockade of a'place. This extension of thelaw w o u l ~ b e n o t l ~ i ~ i g
but a violation of the rights of neutrals and an attack on their commerce. The British have set the example. No natiou has been
disposed to imitate it, nor has been interested in doing so, and perhaps the United States is more interested than any other power in
not adopting a system contrary to the rights and commerce of neutrals.
Convinced that Commodore Preble cannot have been authorized to
ignore principles which have become, in this matter, the basis of
international law and universally accepted usage, 1 ask you, Sir, to
request him, in the name of your government, not to interpret orders,
which he may have received, with a freedom which is as injurious as
it is unusual and to declare a port blockaded only when all the indispensable conditions are fulfilled under which neutral nations have no
right to protest against such a declaration.

SIR, Since I had the honour of writing you on the 26@ Ins! I have
received Letters from J n ? Gavino Esquire, informing me of the arrival
of a ship a t Gibralter from rjorfolk laden with Provisions and Stores
for the use of the United States Squadron in the Mideteranian, and
that he had determined to Order her immediately to Malta, as he
considered the risque of going up without Convoy so trifling that i t
would be improper to detain the Ship a t Gibralter such a length of
time, as it must take for me to get Letters from h i , and arrive there
to take her under Convoy. I think hlr Gavino has determined very wisely, and have no doubt
but the Ship will arrive safe. I shall leave this place in three or four days for Tangier and Gibralter, and if the weather is such that I can with safety keep a t Sea, shall
run to the Eastd as far as Cape DeGatt, and Cape Pallos, where most
likely I shall Cruize for some time. I shall write every oppertunity, and keep you advised of all my

Proceed with all possible dispatch for the Coast of Tripoly; The
Ketch Intrepid under the Command of Lt Decatur with Seventy
Volunteers from the Squadron is ordered to accompnny you, to
endeavor to effect the destruction of the Frigate Philadelphia by
burning her in the Harbor of Tripoly.
Previous to your approaching so near the Coast that the Syren can
be discovered from the Shore, you are to disguise her by changing
the Color of your paint, sending Top Gall' masts on deck, rigging in
flying Jibb boom, Housing guns, Shutting in Ports, raising quarter
cloths &9"0 give the appearance of a Merchant Vessel
I concieve the Object in view can be best effected in the night;
You will therefore keep a t a distance from Tripoly untill the Evening,
but not so far but that you can reach the Harbor by Midnight: The
Intrepid being rigged in a manner peculiar to the Mediterranean
probably will not be suspected bp the enemy, of course it will be most
adviseable to send her ahead in order that she may stand into the
Harbor, and board the frigate
I have no doubt but Lt Decatur with the Officers and men under
his command will be able to take ossession of, and destroy her: As
soon as the Intrepid has entered t e Harbor, you will stand in and
anchor in such a position as you, in your Judgment, may think best
calculated to afford her assistance in the execution of the main object,
cover her retreat or destroy any of the Enemies Cruizers that may be
in the Harbor by sending your boats for that purpose
I t will be most proper for you to enter the harbor with a Westerly
Wind as i t will ensure you a safe retreat. The destruction of the
Frigate is of Kational importance, and I rely with confidence on your
Valor Judgment & Enterprize in contributing all the means in your
power to effect it. Whatever may be your success you will return if
possible directly to this place
May the Almighty take you under his protection and prosper you

took on board upwards of an hundred Tripolines a m e d with Swords
and lMuskets - slipped his Cables - hauled down the Turk's, and
hoisted Tripoline colours, and went out to the attack; and as soon
as the Frigate surrendered, boarded her, - plundered the Officers
and Men, and conducted them as prisoners to the Bashaw. In
consequence of this conduct I have detained him and his crew, and
shall make prize of the vessel. The Captain and Crew having acted
hostile towards our Flag, under enemies colours, I cannot release
either the Vessel or them, as I hare no doubt but should they meet
an American hferch: Vessel they would witfiou t hesitation capture
her. If a Tripoline, he is a prize; if a Turk, a pirate
I find on tran~lat~ion
of the papers that 23 of the Xegroes belonged
to the Bashaw of Tripoly, which he intended as presents to the Captain
Pacha, and other Officers; and 20 of them belonged to the Officers
and Merchants of Tripoly, which were for sale. I have among the
Tripoiine prisoners a chouix of the Bashaw's and a Col. of his Troops,
besides a number of Tripoline Soldiers.
The prize is equipped as a cruiser. She sails tomorrow with 70
Volunteers from the Squadron on board, under the command of
Captain Decatur whose orders are, to burn the Philadelphia in the
Harbour of Tripoly. The Syren Brig goes with him to assist with
her Boats, and cover the retreat. I hope they will succeed; it is of
Natiooal importance that they should.
I have r e d letters from Cap? BB[ainbridge] as late as the lgth
Ins! he compIains of not having received one from me, notwithstanding I hare u-ritten several From Malta last week I forwarded Clothing, Stores & Money to s considerable amount, to the care of the English and Danish Consds. The Bashaw has received my proposals for
an exchange of Prisoners ere this, but I hare no answer. Rllile I
was a t Malta I received proposals from the Bashaw of TripoIy's Agent
for a peace, which he says he is authorised by the Bnshaw to negotiate The Bashnw finds we are making considerable preparations for
the next Summer, and has become alarmed. His Agent proposcd a
truce for 10 years. 1told him that would not do. I had several conversations with him and assured him we never would consent to pay
a cent for Peace or Tribute. He then proposed that we should give
the Bashaw 500 Dollars for each of the Philadelphia's Officers and
Crew - a Schooner in exchange for the Frigate, and make peace
without Money or Tribute and that they would exchange 60 Americans, for the sixty Tripolines in my possession. This would be gnining Peace on more reasonable terms than is expected by our GOT-ernment
Say 300 American Captives
60 Tripolines deduct'd

and we should gain something by exchanging one of the worst
schooners for the Frigate. If you could prevail on MI OBrien to come
here with Cap' Smith as he speaks the language of Barbary, he could
be of infinite service in any negotiation. I should he glad to see you
both here, and wish I had a larger yessel to send for our accommodation; but if you cannot leave Algers a t present, w at sum will you

DEARSIR, I write you in great haste. Your favor by the Syren
came safe, for which, accept my thanks. I believe the Bashaw has a
disposition to make Peace with the United States. For particulars
I refer you to Col: Lear. Capt-ainbridge
thinks with me, that if
you would afford Four services to your Country, by coming up here,
and remaining a few weeks with me, to assist at anF negotiation that
may be entered into uith Tripolx: your knowledge of the Language
and people with whom we have to negotiate, would give us advantages
which we cannot otherwise have. I wish you to converse with Col:
Lear on this subject. You may rely on my endeavors to make your

There is a Vessel arrived hear from Tripoli, the News by hir is much
the same as formerly viz that Provisions is still high and by the different Accounts which I have had the People is murmuring much
against the Bashaw they seem all to agree that when your Vessels
appear off Tripoli with his Brother on Board they %ill Murder the

SYRACUSE Feby 1803 [I8041
This evening, my Dear Mother, I sail for Tripoli on board of a
prize (we took on the 23'@ Decr) in company with the Brig Syren
Capt. Stewart, for the purpose of burning the Frigate Philadelphia
wlvch is now in the possession of the Tripolitans. Lieut. Decatur
commands the prize. - We are certain of success, not only in accomplishing that project, but are in hopes to be able to cut out of Tripoli
several of their cruizers. Our prize when we took her was bound to
Constantinople with presents for the great folks in those parts from
the Bashaw of Tripoli, consisting of 50 black Slaves & money appropriated for the purpose of purchasing merchandize - I was then in

the Constitution. The Tripolitans we have in close custody, I believe
their number amounts to 12. Besides these we have the Grand Segniors
ambassador for Tripoli, who was on his return home. After a short
cruize off Tripoli we returned here, & the Commodore wishing to
make some regulations for the better accommodation of Capt Bainbridge & his officers thought proper to go to Malta. I had the honor of
accompanying him thither - We remained ten days during which
time we lived on shore: I m o t e you a very short letter from thence
for which I must beg leave to excuse myself not knowing of any
opportunity until1 the moment the Commodores dispatches were to
be sent on board of an English Frigate bound to Gibraltar. My
friend Christopher by this time must have arrived in America I shall expect him out here next summer a Lieutenant on board of
one of the Frigates I understand are coming out here Before this day week I am in hopes we shall have the happiness
of seeing the Philadelphia in flames- We shall astonish the Bashaws
weak mind with the noise of shot falling about his ears Perhaps some
shot "more lucky than the rest may reach his heart" & free our countrymen from Slavery It is this idea which keeps us all alive here for
upon my word nothing can be more detestable than this Syracuse I have not put my foot on shore here for six weeks & have been a
greater part of the time within a stones throw of the place. RiIalta
is a charming place comparatively speaking - There one has some
mode of enjoyment - Masquerades Balls Governors Gardens,
Parades, fine Ships, & folks to whom you map converse, all which
one loses a t Syracuse - Is there no hope of a Spanish War? Who
would not be a Soldier in these times in Louisiana? At all events
there, there is some chance for distinguishing one's self - here we
have to go in their very houses before we can make them fight. And
the thought of who it is we fight. A parcel of poor wretches without
a single spark of honor & in conquering them no honor is to be derived
Does not my Brother the Capt regret having hauled himself up
in ordinary? I see his arrival in New York announced in one of the
Papers - I presume from that he has been paying you a visit with
his cara sposa.
What a mountain they have made of a mouse I allude to what
I see in the Newspapers concerning our "terrible" affair with the
Emperor of Morocco. Capt Rodgers acquired vast applause for
burning a Tripolitan ship of 22 Guns - Our Commodores name I
am glad to see is mentioned with some bclat. Remember me most

Preble, U. S. Bavy

U: S. SHIPConstitution

Syracuse Harbour Feb? 3 r d 1804
SIR, I have the honor to inform you that, since my last letter from
Malta, I have discovered that the Vessel [Mastico, renamed Intrepid]
which I captd off Tripoly the 23rd December last, was a t Anchor in
the Harbour when the Philadelphia ran on the rocks. That as soon
aa the Frigate took the ground, the Captain took on board u wards
of one hundred Tripolines, hauled down the Turkish, and oisted
Tripoliie Colours; Slipped his cables, and went out to the attack;
and as soon as the Frigate surrendered, the Captain and Men proceeded on board the Philadelphia; undered the Officers; made
prisoners of, and conducted them on s-Elore to the Bashaw of Tripoly.
As 1 have clear proof of their having acted thus hostily towards our
Flag the moment they have an opportunity, I have a right to believe,
the would not hesitate to do it again, if I should release the Vessel
an crew, and they should fall in with an American Vessel of inferior
force. I have, therefore, detained her for adjudication; and as she
is not a proper Vessel to cross the Atlantic a t this season of the year,
I shall forward all the pa ers necessary for her condemnation. She
has been valued a t 1800 cf'ollars, and as there cannot be the smallest
doubt of her being a lawful prize, I have fitted her out as a cruiser,
with 4 Guns & 70 Volunteers from the Squadron, among whom, are
10 Officers under the Command of Lieu$ Decatur. She sailed last
evening for Tripoly; the object is, to destroy the Philadelphia. She
sailed in company with the Syren Brig Lieu$ Stewart, who hag orders
to assist her with Boats in effecting the main object, and cover a
retreat. I enclose you copies of their orders. I am confident of
their success if the weather proves favourable. The prize being
Ketch or Bombard ri ged, and neither of our Brigs ever having been
of3 T r i m , they wdfnot probably create suspicion; particularly as
the Brlg will be disguised before she approaches the coast, to give her
the a earance of a Mercht Vessel. Our Frigates and Schooners are
so we known, that they create alarm the moment they are seen.

The NauCilzls and Vixen sail tomorrow morning on a cruise; they
are to proceed to Tunis Bay, and communicate with Mr Davis. The
Vban then goes to
iers, and the Nautilus off Tri oly
I have given this s 'p's rigging a thorough over aul, painted the
Hull, and shall immediately proceed to Sea.
I wrote to Naples some time since, to hire or purchase, three or
four Gun & Mortar Boats, pre ared with Guns and Mortars. If
I succeed in procuring them,
can attach them to the different
Vessels as thex Boats, and I think work with effect on Tri ly, aa
soon as the Spring opens. I mentioned in my last letter &t the
Bashaw's Agent at Malta had consented to make peace with us, on
the following terms Viz. No pecuniary consideration for Peace or
Tribute. No consular present, except a small one with the Consul
that may be first appointed. A schooner in exchange for the Frigate;
and 500 dolls for the ransom of each of her Officers and Crew, after
exchanging as many Americans for Tripolines, as we have Tlipolines
to give them Say 300 American Captives
Deduct 60 Tripoline prisoners to be exchanged
leaves 240 Americans to ransom a t $500 pr- $120,000
He afterwards concluded, that the Bashaw would take One hundred
thousand doll? for ransom, we giving up the Tripoline Prisoners, and
make peace as above. I have written to Col Lear on the subject for
his advice what to do, if the Bashaw lessens his demand as I suspect
he will, should the PhiEadelphia be destroyed. If it was not for the
situation of our unfortunate Country Men, I should be sorry to have
peace with the Bashaw, until we could oblige him to beg for i t as a
favour, and sign any treaty that night be dictated to him. I am
anxiously ulshmg for the favourable season to arrive, when we can
keep constantly near Tripoly ; closely blockade their ports, and annoy
thex Coast, to prevent the possibility of their Vessels cruising, destroy
their commerce, and distress their City - We ought to have a Brig
& Schoonar to cruise between Cape Bon and the West end of Sicily.
A Brig or Schooner off Cape Mazuratt to the south of Tripoly a Bng
on the coast of Calabria; two Frigates with one Schooner and some
Gun and Mortar Boats before Tripoly; and a Brig or Schooner to
cruise from Derne to Bengaza. With such a force so disposed, or
with Troops, Tripoly would soon be brought to any terms we might
please to dictate. Gun and Mortar Boats are for the Summer service
most essential.
I shall write you by every opportunity; and I now enclose you
sundry papers for your information.
I sent to Captarn Bainbridge One thousand dollqrom Malta last
Week, and a quantity of clothing for his Officers & c V conceive it
my duty to attend to their Rants, and shall most certainly do so.
Captain B - complains of not having recq letters from me, I have
written a number, and it has been altogether the fault of Mr Pulis,
that they have not been forwarded, together with a supply of newssaries left with him for that purpose - m?lilst I was a t Malta I
detected Mr Pulis in a transaction of a very unpleasant Nsture: he
had received a large number of letters from America for the Officers
of the Squadron; and some from the Officers of the Squadron for their
friends in the Mediterranean, America and London he kept these

31

386

letters on hand a long time; by accident I discovered that he had a
large number in his possession and requested a sight of them; he at
first hesitated, but as I persisted in my right of seeing them, he produced four large packages directed to the care of Mr Gavino at Gibraltar to be forwarded to the U S, which he said were letters from himself and others to their friends in America. I knew that several of
them were for the Navy depi and an English Man of T a r to sail
immediately for Gibraltar, I lnsisted on his opening the packages and
giving me all the letters from the Officers of the Squadron. he did
not chuse to do it, which increased my suspicions that all was not
right, and I opened one of the Packages in presence of him and four
of my Officers in which I discovered the letters that had come out for
the O5cers of the Squadron for some time past and all the letters
that had been for the Officers at Tripoly kept b Mr Pulis and that
he was actually sending them back to America A 1 the other packages
were in the same situation, and neither of them contained a single
letter from him - M' Pulis was formerly Consul to the Bashaw of
Tripoly, has no respectability attached to his character - cannot
speak a word of English, and is by no means a proper representative
for the U S to have in the Island of Malta - I wrote you from Malta
that I had employed Mr William Higgins as an ent fm the Squadron;
he has every qualification to make a respectab e Consul, and I wish
for the good of the Service, that the change may take place; be assured
I have no other Motive

Your favor of the 12'h Novr enclosing your circular notification of
the blockade of the Port of Tripoli, I have received. Sensible, as you must be, that i t is the interest as well as the disposition of the United States to maintain the rights of neutral nations,
you will, I trust, cautiously avoid whatever may appear to you to be
incompatible with those rights. I t is, however, deemed necessary
and I am charged by the President to state to you what, in his opinion,
characterizes a blockade. I have therefore to inform you that the
trade of a neutral nation in articles, not contraband, cannot be rightfully obstructed to any port not actually blockaded by a force so disposed before it as to create an evident danger of entering it. Whenever
therefore you shall have thus formed a blockade of the port of Tripoli,
you will have a right to prevent any vessel from entering i t and to
capture for adjudication any ressel that shall attempt to enter the

however not take as prize any vessel attempting to enter the Port
ii
such knowledge; but in every case of an attempt
of ~ r i ~ owithout
to enter without a previous knowledge of the existence of the blockade,
ou will give the commanding Officer of such vessel notice of such
glockade and forewarn him from entering. And if after such a notification such vessel should again attempt to enter the same Port,
you will be 'ustifiable in sending her into port for adjudication.
You will, ir, hence perceive that you are to consider your circular
communication to the Neutral Powers, not as an evldence that every

gut merely as a friendly notification to them of the blockade in order
that they might make the necessary arrangements for the discontinuance of all commerce with such blockaded Port. -

1st. To discontinue the services of certain officers and men who
have been found to be superfluous.
2d. Instead of entering a certain portion of men for each ship, and
as the peace establishment law directs, attaching them ermanently
to such ship, to enter the men for the general service of e yard, and
to assign to them one ship, as a place of eating, sleeping, &c.

&

To Secretary of the Navy from Lieutenant John Caesin, U. S. Navy

JANUARY
23, 1804.
SIR:Since I have had the honor of being entrusted with the charge
of the ships in ordinary, many objections to the system rescribed
by the act of Congress, providing for a naval peace esta lishment,
in relation to the officemg and manning the vessels in ordinary,
have occurred to me. To provide a remedy, and suggest it for your
consideration, I have reflected much on the subject, and have advised
with gentlemen of the first practical information. The result I now
beg leave, respectfully, to submit :
By the act of March 3, 1801, it is provided that there shall be
permanently attached to each frigate laid up in ordinary, one sailingmaster, one boatswain, one gunner, one carpenter, one cook, one
sergeant, or corporal of marines, and eight marines; and to the large
frigates, twelve, and to the small frigates, ten seamen. The sailingmaster of each ship to have the general care and superintendence of
the ship, and generally to execute such duties of a purser as may be
necessary.
reeably to the provisions of this law, and the instructions which
you ave, from time to time, honored me with, the ships placed under
my care have heretofore been officered and manned. My objections
to the resent system, are, 1st. The officers and men being dis ersed
in sma squadrons on board of a number of ships, cannot be co ected
with that facility or despatch which is desirable.
2d. There being a squadron of men on board of each ship, there
must necessarily be a fire kept on board each ship to cook at, and in
proportion to the number of fires is our danger of suffering from them.
3d. The 0 5 ~ 0 cannot
1 ~
be sufEciently em loyed, and our experience
has demonstrated that even good officers
degenerate if not actively
employed. I t will be perceived, in the sequel, that there are other

6

%

e

f

w8

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS

objections to the present system. They are, however, subordinate to
the three principal objections above recited, and proceed from them.
With respect to the first objection, it is obviously desirable that
our force should be concentrated as much as possible. If all were
drawn from one point, it could be applied at a moment's warning. For
many days together the services of the men are required for one
common object; every day, therefore, when their services are so
required, we unavoidably lose time in collecting them.
2dly. I t is manifestly true that, under the present system, we are
exposed to great and constant danger from fire, and a considerable
proportion of the time of the men is unavoidably employed in cleaning
up dirt made by themselves on board of their respective vessels, and
dirt is a powerful auxiliary in rotting a ship.
3dly. As our officers are not sufficiently employed, they will not avoid
setting an evil example of idleness and inactivity. While at sea,
sailing-masters, boatswains, gunners, and carpenters, have all important duties to discharge, and they would have important duties in a
vessel in ordinary, if all the rigging, sails, cables, guns, spars, &c.
were kept on board.
But, under the present system, every article belonging to these
departments is taken from on board the vessels, and deposited on
shore, and neither of these officers have a single article under their
charge, excepting the master, who, under my superintending control,
has the general charge of the ship; our experience having evinced
the inexpediency of requiring masters to perform the duties of pursers,
the provision which has been substituted will, I have no doubt, be
found a very salutary one.
Having suggested these defects in the present system, it bec,omes
me also to suggest a remedy, which I do, with great deference, by
proposing1st. That the establishment of officers and men a t the navy yard
shall consist of only the following:
1 Master of the yard,
2 Gunners, one sail-maker,
1 Head carpenter and constructor,
1 Shipkeeper to each ship, and
with his crew,
100 Seamen, and three guards of
1 Purser,
marmea,
Plumber, blacksmith, and crew,
1 Clerk, to keep the account of the
stores,
Block-maker and crew,
Cooper and crew.
1 Clerk of the yard,
2 Boatswains,

We have a t present:
1 Clerk of the yard,
10 Sailingmaatera,
Plumber, blacksmith, and crew,
1 Carpenter, head and crew,
11 Boatswains,
Block-maker and crew,
11 Gunners,
Cooper and crew,
130 Seamen,
11 Carpenters, one sail-maker,
1 Clerk, to keep the account of the 11 Guards of marines,
stores,
1 Purser.

2d. That all the men have their cooking done, diet and sleep, on
board of one ship, or in a house to be built for the purpose. This
arrangement would not only diminish the expense, a s a pears by
paper A, and increase the security of the public property, ut would
enable me to discharge the duties assigned to me mth increased
facility and despatch.

B

394

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1803 TO 1804

Under the proposed arrangement, it would be the duty of the
master of the yard to attend to laying down the buoys, marking out
the channel, to be in readiness with the proper pilots to go on board
of ships of the United States, at the mouth of the branch, and to bring
them up to their moorings, and take them from thence to sea; to be
vigilant in despatching boats necessarily provided for the relief of
such vessels coming into port, and for the discharge of stores, &c.
having them carefully conveyed to the warehouses appropriated to
the same. To visit the ships in ordinary at least once a day, in
order that they should be kept clean and sweet, and properly ventilated to prevent decay, and in case of delinquency to report thereof.
When any ship of ships should be ordered for sea, to attend particularly to the distribution of officersand men, as may be found necessary
to facilitate the execution of such order. To state from under his
hand a proportion of rigging, ground tackle, and stores, for the boatswains, that the superintendent may warrant the store-keeper in the
issue thereof. He is to specify the size, length, and quantity, of each
required, in order to frame indentures for the boatswains of each
ship to sign previous to leaving port. When it becomes necessary
for the crews in ordinary to perform duty in the yard, to regulate the
distribution of officers and men for the better performance thereof;
to attend to the moorings of the ships in proper season; to see the
cables well secured from ice or other in ury; their boats carefully collected and placed under cover, when no onger necessary to be exposed
to the weather; to attend in person on board of ships removin
their moorings to dock, &c. I t is also necessary that he shoufdfrom
pay
great care and attention to the ships' spars received a t the navy
yard, and suggest such measures as will prevent their decay. I t is
further necessary that he should visit the warehouses frequently,
and examine the stores of each ship, placin them in a state of foradmit.
wardness, as far as the state of ordinary
The boatswains and gunners would be placed under the immediate
eye of the master of the yard, and should have the particular charge
and direction of crews employed in their respective departments.
The three guards of marines would be placed, one on board the
headmost and one on board the sternmost ships, to prevent boats
coming inside of the moorings a t night, &c. and one guard in the yard
to prevent desertion and to guard the public property there.
The duties of the other officers have already been prescribed to
them by you, and are well known to themselves.
Thus, sir, I have taken the liberty of suggesting to you the aforementioned arrangement, which, in my opinion, would effectually
remove all the obstacles a t present opposed to the security of the
public property committed to my care, and to the due and prompt
execution of any orders with which you may honor me, as superintendent of the ysrd.
All which is most respectfully submitted.
I have the honor to be, sir, your obedient humble servant,
JOHNCABBIN,
Superintendent Navy Yard.
Honorable ROBERT
SMITH,

W a s WITH BARBARY POWERS
At present we consume annually about one hundred and thirty
cords of wood, and one thousand bushels of coal. Under the roposed arrangement forty cords of wood and two hundred and &ty
bushels of coal would be sufficient, and the proposed arrangement
contemplates our dispensing with the service of
9 Sailing masters,
9 Boatswains,
9 Gunners,
11 Carpenters,
30 Seamen,
8 Guards of marines;
All of which, it will be found, diminish the expenses of the yard
from twenty to thirty thousand dollars per annum. If the sailing
masters, boatswains, unners, and carpenters, proposed to be dispensed with, were fur oughed and put on half pay, in that case the
saving to the public would be upwards of twenty thousand dollars
a year.

SIR, The unfortunate news of the loss of the Frigate Philadelphia
reached this about two weeks since, being however without information from any of my Colleagues on the subject, I was induced for some
time to encourage doubts of its truth; but it is with deep regret I have
to add, that the intelligence received by the two last mails is such, as
to leave my error too manifest.
As soon as this fatal information was intitled to credence, I delayed
not a moment to address an official note to the Grand Chancellor of
this Empire, soliciting the influence of His Imperial Majesty with the
Turkish Government in behalf of the Officers and Crew, who by this
disaster fell a prey to the merciless barbarians of Tripolie - You
must be convinced of the importance of an intercession so ascendant
as that of a Monarch of Russia, Who, from the eminent position He
has taken the present War, has added weight to the power and Consequence which He maintains throughout Europe. I have the most
cordial satisfaction Sir, in felicitating you and my Country on the
magnanimous part which His Imperial Majesty has deigned on this
occasion so promptly to take, and I delay not a moment to transmit
the inclosed Copy of the Chancellors letter that you, and all attached
to the Squadron under your Command, mag share in the general
gratification it is calculated to produce. If no effective measures have been employed, on our receipt of this,
in behalf of our Suffering fellow Citizens, you d b e too sensible of
the powerful influence of the Court of St Petersburg a t Constantinople,
to delay improving the value of its interposition: I t will in that case
perhaps, conduct you to a Correspondence with Mr drItalinskyRussian

be admitted as far as the items of which they consist are comprised
within the rules established by my letter of the lit@ July last; and
the following may also be admitted, viz: Customary presents a t
public feasts, expences of horses & carriages, repairs of the house
& appurtenances, hire of boats, porterage, postage, sums paid to
Couriers, and small presents to Messengers coming on public business.
On the reference of the demand on account of the Gloria to the
Navy Department it was rejected under the idea that no such addition
could be made to the Naval establishment without an express legal
sanction, but from the nature of the service for which she was destined
she may be looked upon as retained for giving and receiving intelligence. Under this impression her hire may be settled at a reasonable
rate for the period she may have been actually employed in such
service. The last charge of 10,131-781100 Dollars under date of
August 1802, is under all circumstances of the case not admissible
under any proper exercise of the discretion vested in the Executive.
As the Bey of Tunis has admitted the receipt of the Military and

omitted to charge M' Eaton with them.

ALGIERS
FebY ldtb 1804
DEARSIR I had the pleasure of writing to you on the 16'h of
December, under cover to D' Davis, our Charge d'AfTairs at Tunis,
and forwarded a copy on the 2d ins: through the same channel. I
also wrote to Citizen Beaussier, the Commissary Geni of the French
Republic, at the same time, and enclosed a letter for you from iMr
Thainville the French Agent here. Immedi~telyon hearing of your
misfortune I authorized D' Davis to give every necessary supply to
yourself & our unfortunate fellow Citizens, with you, and to enable
him to do so, I placed a credit of ten thousand dollars in his hands.
Since that I have r e d a letter from Dr Davis of the 27'Q of Decr
acknowledging the receipt of my letter &:. and enclosing a copy of his
to you on the 20thof Decr I sent to our Govt the account of your misfortune, as soon as it came
to my linowledge, and of the steps which I had taken in consequence,
and have the pleasure to know that my letters have gone from Alicant
to the U. S. by good & safe oppertunities. I yesterday r e d a letter from the Honble Charles Pinkney, our
Minister a t Madrid, in which he informs me, that upon hearing of
our misfortune, he had applied to the French & British Ministers a t
b a d r i d to write to the Agents of their respective nations, a t Tripoli,
to use their best endeavours that the unfortunate situation of yourself & fellow Citizens might be rendered as comfortable as possible
in Captivity, and authorized them to use 3 or 4000 dollars, if necessary,
to supply your immediate wants, and look to him for reimbursement;
adding that he did this without any special authority from our Govr
knowing that our affairs with Barbary were committed to the care of
Commodore Preble & myself; but he was led to do it from motives of
humanity, lest I might not have had timely notice of your misfortune,
or any accident aha retard supplies from this quarter. - He requests

404

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1803 TO 1804

me to assure you & the others of our fellow Citizens in Captivity of
his sincere cornmisseration, & earnest desire to render you every service
in his power. At the same time I received a letter from Mr Cathcart, dated a t
Leghorn Decr 13'5 informing me that he had authorized Mr Nyssen,
the Danish Consul a t Tripoli, to furnish 3 or 4000 dollars for your use,
and that he shq purchase two suits for each man from his private
funds. The style of M! Cathcarts letter to me was arrogant & dictatorial, and carrying with it an idea that he was the person empowerd
to do these things. He tells Mr Nyssen that as he has no more cash,
he shall write to our Agents at Algiers to furnish him further, &
expects that I shall do it. - Had MI: C any reason to believe me
ignorant of my powers & duties, or neglegent in attending to them,
he might well have written in this manner. - Mr C should consider
that he is now but a private Citizen; & further, he should remember,
that his conduct has given disgust (whether right or wrong) to the
Barbary powers; and therefore it could do no good to our affairs for
him to assume an agency in them. - Had humanity alone dictated
this measure I am sure no one would have given him more credit than
myself; but I see in it more of a wish to appear consequential & arrogate to himself a power which he possesses not, than anything else.
I am however, sincerely happy that there are so many sources of
supplies for our unfortunate Countrymen. I hope, my dear Bainbridge, you will not think hardly of me for
speaking thus of a man, who has taken measures for the relief of those
of our Countrymen who are in misfortune. God forbid I should do
any thing but thank him for the act; but I confess, the manner in
which he has done it, as it relates to me, has wound my feelings;
for I trust that yourself & those with you will have no cause to accuse
me of inattention to your wants.
Affairs between the British & this Regency have assumed a very
serious aspect. - In April last the Dey sent Mr Falcon, the British
Consul out of this Regency, with marks of high indignity; and soon
after his Cruizers to a number of Vessels having the passports of
General Ball & others, condemned & sold vessels & cargoes, and kept
the crew in slavery. - This business was dormant here 'till the 16t@
ultimo, when 8 British Ships of the line, with Lord Nelson, in the
Victory, appeared of[f] the Harbour. Cap$ Keets came to anchor
in the Superb of 74 Guns, with Mr Falcon on board. The letters of
Lord Nelson to the Dey, insisting upon his receiving Mr F. again as
Consul, making an apology for sendin him out of the Country, in
the manner he did, and pving up the rews of those Vessels bearing
British passport%,& maklng indemification for the Vessels & Cargoes,
were received b him with great indignity. Cap! Keets had an interview with the g e g on the 16'Q in which he urged those points with
high Language, such as the Dey never heard before. The Dey retorted
and much altercation ensued. The Dey absolutely refused to receive
Mr Falcon again, or to yield any one point. - The next day the
Ships stood into the Bay. Caps Keets came on shore again; but the
Dey refused to see him, saying he had given him his answer yesterday.
Every preperation was made for defence. An immediate att,ack was
expected; but the Ships tacked & stood out of the Bay again. The
next day they were 5 or 6 Leagues to the N.E. (excepting the Supeyb,
which stood on & off in the Bay; but had no communication mth

8

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS

405

the shore) calm or light airs all day. On the 1gtb the Ship disappeared,
and have not been seen since. The heroic character of Lord Nelson
forbids the idea of fear, on the part of the British, with such a force;
and there can be no doubt but he was called off on other business
which could not be delayed; particularly as another Ship joined him
on the morning of his departure. - Thus stands the busmess & we
are in anxious expectation of the issue. This appearance of the British fleet has caused some commotion
here, and much irritation against the Jews, who are supposed to have
been the cause of the dispute with the British. Busnah, the Jew,
was attacked by a Turk in the Street & slightly wounded. The
whole paternity are in fear & trembling, and frequent robberies which
happen in the neighbourhood of the City, causes no small degree of
alarm: - Indeed there seems to be a discontent prevailing which
threattens serious consequences. I have not received any letters from the U. States since my arrival
here; nor heard a word from Commodore Preble since he left this
Bay on the 21" of Novr. By a letter which I received yesterday
from Mr Gavino, he informs mc that a Vessel arrived from Baltimore
which brings accounts of Cap$ Sterretts recruiting men for the Esser,
which may be daily expected in this Sea. I feel anxious to hear from you & know the situation of yourself,
your Officers & men, and manyeother important points in which you
will be able to give me information. Mr O'Brien is still here, his wife has lately presented him with a
fine Boy, and I presume they will hardly depart untiU the season is
morc favourable. - They send their best regards to you. Mra Lear desires me to tell you how much she thlnks of yourself
& our other fellow citizens in captivity, and how anxiously she wishes
your deliverance.
Remember me to those about you. I need not say you must bear
your misfortune like men; for I know you will do i t ; and with my best
wishes you may be assured that everythmg will be done for you in
the power of,

His demands Could not be executed here or a t Toulon unless this
Government should grant us the permission to purchase, build or fit
out such vessels & export the ammunition desired, which is forbidden
by the existing laws of France - I t is also doubtfull, whether this
Government would consent Such an armament be made in the Ports
of France by a power in war against tripoly.
I Should have wrote already to the Prefect Maritim a t Toulon on
that Subject, but he could do nothing - without orders from the Minister of Marine - This being an object of dyplomacy, which, if
obtained, must be kept Secret, I cannot apply to any to treat this
matter with this hlinister or that of foreign Relations than to you,
Sir, to do it properly & Efficaciously; - If the Should have Such
Vessells not to be employed in this war ngahlst England, they might
wish to Sell them and give orders a t Toulon in Conformity or let us
build them at Toulon, La Seyne or Marseilles after their own h4odcls;
& I hope they could be built & Ready two months after such permission granted Should have reached me.
Unfortunately we have too many Americans in Captivity a t

be the signal to put to death the Sweedish Captives i n his power! I s

DEARSIR Your much esteemed favors have this day come to hand,
to which I have replied fully by this conveyance. In my former letters I have sug ested the idea of destroying the Frigate; since then
having had the fiberty of walking out, and having seen the situation
she is anchored in, I do conceive that it could be easily effected. She
lays about three quarters of a mile from the shore. By not showing
the vessels off here before the attempt is made, there is not the least
doubt of success. Let the boats be well prepared with combustibles
to set her on fire, the only thing to be attempted. At present all the
gun boats are hauled up.
The most important part to guard against the Tripolitan Cruisers
is in my opinion between Cape Bon and Sicily. Should the Tripolitans demand be too great I would reccommend an attack by land about
night. A thousand troops would do. Fri ates will not answer. I
presume that the Frigate Philadelphia w be offered to Tunis or
Algiers. This if possible should be prevented.
My grateful wishes attend you in your undertakings.

was wanting, but alas! for us, they made no such an attempt, but pursued a Plan in which they risqued nothing, and was certain must
prove effectual, the Ship Careening in such a manner as made every
Gun become useless. Our situation was like a man tied to a stake
attacked by another with arms. Believe me my Commodore, it cannot even be justly conceived but by the unfortunate who experienced
it. God forbid that any of my Brother Officers should be placed in a
similar situation
Your letter to Siddi Mahomet D'ghies Minister of Foreign Affairs,
I have delivered. The one addressed for the Warrant Officers & Crew
I have judged proper (by the latitude you gave me) not immediately
to deliver it, and upon further reflection may withhold it altogether;
if I should, I shall give my reasons for so doing Your letter for the Swedish Consul I shall retain as John Willson
(the greatest Villain I ever h e w ) has turned Renegado Accept of my
thanks for the attention you paid to my situation, and for the stile
in which you addressed him.
In answer to your questions respecting the manner we are treated,
and if they robbed us of our Watches kc"
shall briefly reply. That
mysdf and all otltcrs lost everything except what was on our Backs,
and part of that tore off Our Pockets picked, Watches and Money
taken, even to Pocket handkerchiefs 8: Gloves, To answer our immediate necessity, we have purchased some qf our own cloths - As
for the treatment we have received, there is no change since my
report to you, except about eight days ago, myself and O5cers
received permission to walk out, Six or Eight a t a time, with the
Drogoman who attends on us. this indulgence gave us an opportunity
of breathing fresh air, which we had not done for three Months and
nine days We are supported entirely at our own expence, and live in
the House that Mr Cathcart occupied. Our situation now is rendered
tolerably comfortable. The Crew are confined in a separate Prison a
part of which are daily employed a t various work; they are allowed
Bread and Oil, but no meat. I have given them Beef once a week,
being as often as our finances would admit of and have been able to
buy clothing to the amount of about five hundred dollars which has
afforded them a change. Enclosed you will receive a list of Cloths
that they will stand in need of the next autumn 8: Winter, if it should
be our hard fate to continue here. Since our captivit'y two have died,
and seven turned Renegadoes so that our complement now stands 298.
From the very great attention of Mr Davis Charge des affairs at
Tunis, our situation has been much ameliorated, he has twice sent us

Bills to the amount of Nine hundred Dollars, and I have drawn on
him for One thousand Dollars; but my Bills on Tunis are attended
with a loss upwards of 27 pr Ct, which cannot be avoided but by
having money sent to us I have received a very friendly letter from Col: Lear, dated Algiers

Respecting the Vessel you captured off Tripoly, I can only say it
was reported here, that she was a Vessel belonging to the CapWacha.
The Turkish Officer I believe to be the Man who was passenger in the

to Malta. As to the Cargo I should suppose it to be a Bon Prize.
Had you fortunately been off here two days after you made that
capture you would have had a chance of a valuable prim from Derne
I t appears in this climate that fortune attends the ~[nlrighteous.
Our letters from America are all received with the Articles that you
ordered Mr Higgins to send us. also One thousand dollars in Cash.
The necessary receipts I shall send to Mr Higgins. I gratefully thank
you for sending me the suit of Clothes. When you appear off here,
there is no doubt but you may safely communicate with the shore.
Words are too light to express my feelings, if ever opportunity
offers actions shall convince you how much I estimate all your attention. May success attend the Squadron under your command and
Glory and honor be the reward You meet from your Country! is my
sincere wish M: Higgins omitted sending us an invoice of the articles which will
be necessary to make the proper charges. Your letter to Mr Kissen,
does honor to your command, he is one of the best of Men.
I thank you in behalf of the Officers and Crew, in sending to our
Government the valuation of the Mirboka. I hope it will be allowed
to compensate in some measure our loss. Mine has exceeded two

DEAR
SIR, * * * In my former letters I have suggested the idea
of destroying the Frigate, since then having had the liberty of walking out
and have seen the situation she was anchored in, do conceive that it
would be e a d y eflected. She lays about three uarters of a mile, from
the shore; By not showing the Vessels off here,S,efore the attempt was
made, there is not the least doubt of success. Let the Boats be well
prepared with combustibles to set her on fire the only thing to be
attempted at present as all the Gun Boats are huded up
The most important Part to guard against the Tnpolitan Cruisers
is in my opinion between Cape Bon & Sicily Should the Tripolitan's
demand be too great I would recommend an attack by land. About
Eight thousand Troops would do. Frigates will not answer. I presume
that the Frigate Philadelphia wiU be offered to Tunis or Algiers. this
if ossible should be prevented.
grateful wishes attend you, and your transactions

Concerning the captured Brig St. Crusi/iJto

SIR John Baptiste Russo, and Vincent Barbara natives of Malta as
proprietors of the Brigantino Vessel called the Santissimo Crocefisso,
take the liberty to lay before you the titles of their aforesaid property
and other valuable documents in order that their conduct may be
justified, as far as regard their late departure from Malta, till the
moment that the said Brigantino was stopped by the Ships of the
United States, flutering themselves that Your Justice and Equity,
(after laowing the true destination intirely different, and by no mean
intended to violate the Law of the Blockade of Tripoli) you will be
pleased to order the restitution of the said Brigantino Vessel to the
above mentioned proprietors
The title of property is uncontradictory prouved by the contract
of sale made on the 29 of January 1804 by the Public Notary Baldassare
Mamo contracted by Vincenzo Aquilina to the said Russo and Barbara
on paying the price of 2330 Maltese Sardis, and with the Licence of
the President of the Court and the payment of that price - that
therefore no doubt will remain of not being the said Vessel or Maltese
Property
To this title the affraightemcnt made by the same Public Notary
the 31 e t of the said month of January for going to Gerhu as her immediate destination is to be observed; for, the Frei hter hi: Gaetmo
Schembri was bound in it to fournisch the said Vesse with an American
Pass, which precaution shows clearly in what decree the said Proprietors intended to respect the American Power, and absolutly intended
to navigate in those seas with the approbation of the said Power.
This circumstance demonstrated by authentic papers shows Likewise
that the said Proprietors did not intend to violate the Bloakade of
Tripoli
All the papers regarding the expetition or clearances received from
the Public offices at Malta do perfectly answer to prouve the immediate destination for Gerba; for, the licence received from the Customs
for shipping from the Larravetto [?I Seven Bales [?] of Linnen, and 12
of hemp do specify that these goods were to be carried to Gerba; the
paper received from the Health office for taching on Board the said
Vessel seven [word illegible] including two Women, to be landed also
a t Gerba, And finnally the paper from the Gran Visconte's O5ce shows
that the Goverment of Malta sent on Board the said Vessel a Sicilian
to be landed also a t Gerba for his bamishment; After such uncontradictory documents, it will evidently appear that the immediate destination of the said Vessel, was for Gerba, and if the Said Vessel was
found cruising thouwards Tripoli it was in consequence of the contrary
wind which was then blowing from the West and forced them to keep
by that part to avail themselves of the first breese to go to Gerba,
which disposition must be known and approved by every Pilot.

Being every reason wanted to suppose a false intention in the navigation of the said Vessel, and her destination authenticated with so
many Public and Powe[r]full documents and having not the said proprietors and Master any particular interest to go into Tripoli with such
a great danger, The said proprietors hope therefore that after having
shown their manifeste innocence and founded upon Your Justice
Equity and goodness, that the said Vessel will be restored to them as
they Beg and protest themselves your most Humble and Obedt
Servunts.

SIR,I have the honor to inform you, that the U S. Brig Syren Lt

arrived here last evening from a cruise. They left this ort the 3'"nst
with my orders to proceed to Tripoly, and burn the rigah, late the
U S. frigate Philmldphia at anchor in that Harbour.
I was well informed that her situation was such as to render it
impossible to bring her out, and her destruction being absolutely
necessary to favor my intended operations against that city I determined the attempt should be made I enclose you copies of my orders 131 January 18041 on this occasion,
which have been executed in the most allant and Officer like manner
by Lieu[ Commt Decatur, assisted by t e brave Officers & crew of the
little Ketch Intrepid under his command. Their conduct in the performance of the dangerous service assigned them, cannot be sufficiently
estimated - I t is beyond all praise - Had Lieu$ Decatur delayed one
half hour for the Boats of the S'ren to have joined him, he would have
failed in the main object, as a gale comme~cedimmediately after the
Frigate was on fire, and it was with difficulty the Ketch was got out of
the Harbour. The Syren owing to the lightness of the Breeze in the
evening was obliged to Anchor a t a considerable distance from the
City which prevented her Boats from rendering such assistance as
they might have done had they entered the Harbour earlier. Lt
Stewart took the best position without the Harbour to cover the retreat
of the Intrepid that the lightness of the wind would admit of. His
conduct t h o ' the expedition has been judicious and hi hly meritorious.
But few of the O E c m of the Squadron could be grati ed by sharing in
the danger & honor of the Enterprize. In justice to them I beg leave
to observe that they d offered to volunteer their services on the
occasion and I am confident whenever an opportunity offers to distin uish themselves, that they will do honor to the Service.

SIR,I have the honor to inform you, that in pursuance of your orders
of the 1st Ins! to proceed with this Ketch off the Harbour of Tripoly
there to ezldeavour to effect the destruction of the United States late
Frigate Philadelphia. I arrived there in company with the U S Brig
Syren L! Commt Stewart on the 7th, but owing to the Badness of
the weather was unable to effect any thing untill last evening when we
had a light breeze from N. E. At 7 O'clock I entered the harbour
with the Intrepid the Syren having gained her station without the
Harbour, in a situation to support us in our retreat a t % past 9
laid her a long side the Philadelphia, boarded, and after a short contest
carried her. I immediately fired her in the Store Rooms, Gun Room
Cockpit & Birth Deck and remained on board until the flames had
issued from the Spar Deck hatch ways & Ports, and before I got from
alongside the fire had communicated to the rigging and to s. Previous
to our boarding, they had got their Tompions out, and ailed several
times but not a Gun fired The noise occasioned by boarding and contending for possession
(altho' no fire arms were used) gave a general alarm on shore, and on
board their cruisers which lay about a cable and a half's length from
us, and many boats filled with men lay round, but from whom we
recd no annoyance. They commenced a fire on us from all their
Batteries on shore, but with no other effect than one shot passing thro'
our Top Gall! Sail.
The Frigate was moored within half Gun shot of the Bashaw's
Castle, and of their pri~icipalBattery; two of their Cruisers lay within
two cables length on the starboard quarter and their Gun Boats within
half Gun shot on the starboard bow she had all her Guns mounted
and loaded which as they became hot went off as she lay with her
Broadside to the town, I have no doubt but some damage has been
done by them. Before I got out of the harbour, her cables had burnt
off, and she drifted in under the Castle where she was consumed. I
can form no judgment as to the number of Men that were on board
of her; there were about 20 killed -A large boat full got off, and many
leapt into the Sea. We have made one prisoner, and I fear from the
number of bad wounds he has r e d will not recover, altho' every assistance & comfort has been given him I boarded with sixty men & Officers, leaving a guard on board the
Ketch for her defence; and i t is with the greatest pleasure I inform
you, I had not a man killed in this affair, and but one slightly wounded - Every support that could be given I r e d from my Officers, and
as each of their conduct was highly meritorious, I beg leave to enclose
you a list of their names. - permit me also, Sir, to speak of the brave
fellows I have the honor to command, whose coolness and intrepidity
was such, as I trust will ever characterise the American Tars.
I t would be injustice in me, were I to pass over the important
services rendered by Mr Salvador the Pilot, on whose good conduct

when the gale and sea having encreased so much that we could
scarcely show any sail, which continued until the l l t h It then
abated, and I sent for Lieu' Commandant Decatur, and we fixed on
the following plan for the next attempt Viz. he to proceed in the
Intrepid about 5 miles ahead of the Brig, and anchor a t night abreast
of the Eastern Rocks that form the Harbour until the Syren got into
that station or her Boats had joined him - After Midnight he to
proceed in the Intrepid to the Ship, the Boats to keep a t a considerable
distnnce astern of him, until he effected n lodgment in the Frigate,
they were then to board the Intrepid, and reinforce him, or proceed on
such other service, as he might direct.
T i e were driven so far to the Eastward by the gale that we did not
regain our Station off Tripoly until the 15t@when considering the
possibility there was of the Tripolitans having some suspicions of our
intentions, I reinforced L' Decatur with an Officer and Kine Volunteers from the Syren. The necessary arrangement of his Men not
leaving more than 50 to support him in boarding We stood into 8
fathoms Water that night, but could not deterrtline our position not
having seen the town, We were therefore obliged to stand off again,
on the 16th a t 11 Ah1 the Intrepid stood in for the Harbour, and when
she had got her distance we tacked and stood after her, with a light

hoisted his colors supposing us to be English. At 10 o'clock P M
we came with in hail of the Philadel hia, & the Pilot told the men on

& had lost our anchors. They gave us a hawser to make fast to her

boarded her instantly. They Tripolitans on board of her were
dreadfully alarmed when they found who we were. Poor fellows!
About 20 of them were cut to pieces & the rest jumped overboard.
We set fire to her & in less than 15 minutes from the time we first
boarded her the flames were bursting out of her ports. I t is astonishing that not one of our men was the least hurt. But it is a miracle
that our little vessel escaped the flames, lying within two feet of them

soon be humbled. The Commodore has new schemes in his head.

Lewis Heermann, a Surgeon in the Navy of the United States, who
deposeth upon oath, That, having been chosen in common with his
brother officers, by the late Commodore Stephen Decatur, then a
Lieutenant Commandant, to accompany him on an expedition which
had the destruction of the late United States' frigate Philadelphia for
its object, then in possesion of the enemy of the United States, m d lying in the harbor of Tripoli, on the coast of Africa, he, the deponent,
departed, under the command of the said Stephen Decatur, from
Syracuse, in Sicily, on the third day of February, eighteen hundred

and four, in his official capacity as surgeon in the late ketch [Mastico],
(taken a prize by the said Decatur, of the enemy,) and yclep'd the
Intrepid, for this especial occasion, by the late Commodore Edward
Preble, then commanding the Mediterranean squadron; also, that the
United States' brig Syren, Lieutenant Commandant Charles Stewart,
sailed in company, for purposes connected with the expedition. Deponent further declareth, that, in the pursuit of the above object,
uncertainty and continued hardships were experienced by the o cers
and crew of the Intrepid, as arising from an accidental supply of putrid provisions, the frail construction and s m d size of the vessel,
with the occurrence of a severe gale, which, in disappointing early
success, laid the foundation of apprehensions for eventual failure; the
discovery by the enemy of an armed force having being anchored near
the port, being rendered more than probable. That, at or before midday, on the sixteenth of February, the town of Tripoli hove in sight;
that, on the evening of the same day, under an unpromising aspect of
the weather, a council of officers, held on board the ketch, came to the
conclusion of anticipating the hour previously appointed (by Captains Stewart and Decatur, conjointly,) for entering the harbor.
With a full understanding on their part, that the aid of the Syren's
boats was necessarily forfeited by this new arrangement, and the
safety of retreat out of the harbor placed exclusively at the risk of
the officers and men who formed the complement of the Intrepid bold measure - the responsibility of which they justly appreciated,
but, under existing circumstances, was considered a lesser eviI than
that which would have arisen from procrastination. That, by stratagem, and not without difficulty, the ketch was laid along side of the
frigate, at or about ten o'clock. That, under an irresistible impetus,
the assailants boarded and carried her; while 1Midshipman Thomas 0.
Anderson, with a crew detached from the brig Syren on the day before,
took his assigned station in a boat, for the purpose of despatching
those of the enemy who might flee from the carnage of the boarders,
as also to give notice of and attack any of the enemy's force that might
approach the ship. That deponent, according to prior arrangement,
was piaced simultaneously in command of the Intrepid, with orders
suitable to the occasion; that "look-outs" were stationed by him, to
observe any movement in the harbor, and guard against surprise.
That the same precautionary vigilance adopted on board the frigate,
formed one of the fundamental measures of security, as was proved
in the instance of one of the "look-outs," (believed to have been stationed on the starboard bow of the Philadelphia,) reporting in quick
succession the approach of enemy's boats, and their retreat, with an
intern1 of time just sufficient to execute the order which grew out of
it - "of killing all prisoners," and draw from the ketch part of a supply of ammunition, small arms, and pikes, for the defence of the ship.
That, after the hasty retreat of the boats, attributable to the sudden
illumination of the gun-deck a t this juncture, by the lighted candles of
the boarders, combustibles were handed on board, a part of which had
been received on board the ketch a t Syracuse, (where some had been
prepared, and others purchased,) and a part from the brig Syren, after
leaving port. That the systematic arrangement of the pian, embracing every contingency incident to the boarding, capturing, and firing
the ship havin been formed with consumate skill and foresight, the
execution of t ese objects, mlth the greatest regularity, consumed

rat

k

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS
a smaller space of time than could possibly be imagined. That the
boarding officers and crew, literally chased from below deck, were pursued by the flames to the ketch, and herself, from the unavoidable
difficulty of getting from along side, was well nigh enveloped. That,
to obviate this calamity, various and well directed efforts were made
without effect,;until a t last, her boats being got ahead, and her rigging,
&c., cleared, she was successfdly towed out of the influence of the current of air, that, with great violence, rushed from every side towards
the flames, which, issuing from the hatchways, and seizing the rigging
from below to two of the mast heads, then standing, played also most
furiously from every gun-port and scupper hole, athwart the ketch.
That, in the momentary confusion that preceded this escape, the
frigate's boat, which had been captured along side, and the crew killed,
by Mr. T. 0.Anderson's party, a t the commencement of the action,
got adrift, and the enemy's flag of the frigate being also lost, left
no trophy in possession save one Tripolitan, who, towards the close
of operations, was made prisoner by deponent. That the whooping
and screaming of the enemy, on bring boarded and defeated, drew
an almost instantaneous and continued fire of small arms from two
xebecs lying near; and that, after throwing a rocket by Captain
Decatur, which was done immediately upon possession being had of
the ship, a brisk cannonade commenced, and was kept up from the
castle and other batteries.
That, by means of towing, (exclusive1 by one or both of her boats,)
sweeps inboard, and sails set, the ketc made good her retreat, and
had arrived at the rocks forming the outermost boundary of the harbor,
when she was met by the Syren's boats, who, in being so much nearer
at hand than had been calculated on, surprised the nautical officers of
the Intrepid quite as much as had the inquiry of the Captain of the
Pfdadelphiu before boarding her, "respecting the vessel astern,"
meaning the brig Syren; and proving that, notwithstanding her great
distance in the offing, during daylight, she had been noticed. That,
ere this time, the frigat,e's gun's had commenced discharging, and
those of the enemy now slackened their fire; that now also the breeze
freshened, and shortly after increased considerably; but being fair,
made good weather of it. That, sometime after midnight, the ketch
joined company with the Syren, then under way, and a t a distance
m the offing; and that the two vessels reached Syracuse on or about the
nineteenth of the same month. Deponent also states, that, after
the perusal of documents accompanying a report bearing the number
201, of the Naval Committee of the House of Representatives made
at the present session, being the first of the twentieth Congress, he
feels himself bourld likewise to declare, under oath, that in frequent
converse and common parlance with the officers of the brig Syren,
on the incidents of the expedition, he never heard any pretensions
advanced by them, or either of them, to any agency or cooperation
whatever in the consummation of the enterprise within the harbor;
and, moreover, that nothing did ever transpire, in his intercourse
with the o5cers of that vessel, or those of any other vessel in the
squadron, which could have led to an anticipation of the painful
necessity to defend, a t this date, the entire and undivided credit,
acquired nearly one-fourth of a century ago, by the o5cers and crew
of the late ketch Intrepid, and consecrated no less by oficial records

VIRGINIA,BOROUGH
OF NORFOLK,
to Wit:
On this tenth day of March, in the year 1828, before me, Walter
F. Jones, a Notary Public in and for the borough of Norfolk, duly
commissioned and sworn, personally appeared Edmund P. Kennedy,
a Master Commandant in the Navy of the United States, who made
oath that, during the years 1803-'4, he served, in the capacity of
gunner's mate, on board the United States' brig of war Syren, then
under command of Lieutenant Charles Stewart, and one of the squadron in the Mediterranean sea, sailing under the orders of Commodore
Preble. That, some considerable time after the capture of the frigate
Philaddphia, by the Tripolitan gun boats, an expedition was planned
and fitted out to destroy that vessel, then lying nearly equipped in the
harbor of Tripoli. That the brig Syren, and the Ketch Intrepid,
sailed for that purpose from the harbor of Syracuse; the day after
the departure of these vessels, the crew of the Syren were called aft,
and a letter was read, addressed to them by Commodore Preble;
as well as affiant remembers, this letter states the importance of the
destruction of the Philadelphia, and set forth, as an inducement to
the crew, the large amount of prize money which would be awarded
to the vessels composing the expedition. Volunteers were called to
fill up the complement of the Intrepid, and for the general purposes
of the expedition. The whole crew voluntrrred, and it became
necessav to make a selection among the officers and men. The
two vessels proceeded to Tripoli, and it was conserted, that, upon a
certain signal, to hc e v e n from the S y r ~ n the
, Intrepui, accompanied
bv two boats, manned and armed from the Syren, should proceed into
the harbor, for the accomplishment of thrir ob'ect. The night of
the destruction of the Philadelphia, the Syren anc ored off the mouth
of the harbor, her two boats manned and nrmed nlonpsidc. The
Intrepid was in shore, and the signal being made, the two boats
left the Syren, and proceeded to join the Intrepid. The signal,
however, wm not answered; and affinnt understood Licut. Decatur
to have said, that he was, a t the time, so near the batteries, that
any exhibition of lights might hnve caused the discovery of his vessel;
and a l i ~ h tand favorable breeze springing up a t the moment, he
preferred running in without the aid of the boats, to encountering a
delay and exposure which might have defeated the object of the rxpedition. Affiant was in one of the boats which put off from the Syren;
the night was very dark, and the Intrepid having exhibited no light
to indicate her position, the boats lost their way among the rocks,
and were falling in uncertainty, until the Intrepid was seen standing

out of the harbor, when they joined her. The crew of the Syen
were a t quarters nearly the whole night. Affiant further states, that
all the combustibles and materials to be used in burning the Philadelphia were prepared on board the Syren.

DEARSIR I have the pleasure to announce to you the pleasing
intelligence of the Capture and destruction of the Tripolitan Frigate
of 40 Guns, late the United States Frigate Philadelphia by the U . S.
Ketch Intrepid of 4 Guns and 70 Men commanded by Captain
Decatur of the Enterprize who volunteered his services on the occasion.
It is to be regretted that she was so situated that it was impossible to
have brought her out.
On the 3Q Inst the Brig Syren Capt Stewart and Ketch Intrepzd of
4 Guns, fitted for the purpose, and Commanded by Capt. Decatur
with 70 Volunteers from the S uadron sailed for Tripoly with orders
to burn the Frigate in that Har our. They this day returned having
executed m orders much to my satisfaction. On the night of the
16'@Captq %ecatur entered the Harbour of Tripoly with the Ketch,
laid her alongside the Frigate and in a Gallant and m c e r like manner,
boarded and carried her against all opposition: After gaining complete possession he proceeded to fire her with success, and left her in
a blaze, in which she continued until she was totally consumed: He
had none killed & only one wounded. The Tri olitans lost between
20 & 30 Men killed on the Decks: One large oatload made their
escape: some Men ran below & perished in the flames, but the greatest
part jumped overboard: She was moored close to the Batteries with
all her Guns loaded, and two of their Corsairs full of Men lay within
half Musquet shot of her
A fire was kept up on the Ketch by the Batteries, Bashaws' Castle.
and Corsairs: Not a musquet or Pistol was fired by our Men: Every
thing was settled by the sword.
The Syren anchored without the Harbour to cover the retreat of
the Ketch, and sent her Boats to assist but unfortunately the did
not arrive in Season, as the Business was accomplished and the g e t c h
on her wa out before the Boats met her: Had they got in sooner i t
is probab e some of the Tripolitan Corsairs would have shared the
fate of the Frigate -

Concerning the destruction of the Frigate Philadelphia

Statement of the Circumstances attending the destruction of the
Frigate Philadelphia with the names of the Officers and the number
of Men employed on the occasion as laid before the President by the
Secretarg of the Navy, November 13 - 1804. -

On the 31?t January 1804 Commodore Preble lying with his Squadron in the Harbour of Syracuse, gave orders to Lieu1 Charles Stewart,
commanding the Brig Siren of 16 Guns, and to Lieutenant Stephen
Decatur jr cornanding the Ketch Intrepid of 4 Guns $ 75 Men, to
proceed to Tripoli and to destroy the Frigate Philadelphia. of 44 Guns,
then lying in the harbour of Tripoli. Lieu? Decatur had orders to
enter the Harbour in the night, board and set fire to the Phikdelphia
and Lieut Stewart was ordered to take the best possible position without the Harbour to cover the retreat. Under these orders they proceeded immediately to the Coast of
Tripoli but owing to the very heavy gales of wind that usually prevail
there in the winter Season, the Enterprize could not be undertaken
until the 16q February when Lieu? Stewart having taken the best
possible position to effect the object of his Instructions, Lieu5 Decatur
a t 7 O'clock in the night, entered the Harbour of Tripoli, boarded and
took possession of the Philadelphia. This Frigate a t the time she
was boarded had all her Guns mounted and charged, and was lying
within half Gun shot of the Bashaw's Castle and of his princi a1
Battery - Two Tripolitan Cruisers were lying within two Cab e's
length on the starboard quarter and several Gun Boats within half
Gun Shot on the Starbowd bow - and d l the Batteries on shore
were opened u on the Asssilants. About 20 Men of the Philadelphia
were killed, a arge Boat full got off, many leapt into the water, and
one Man was made prisoner. After having gained possession of the
Frigate, Lieut Decatur set fire to the Store-rooms, gun-room, Cock-pit
& birth deck, and with n. firmness highly honorable to him, his Officers
and Men, they remained on Board until the flames had issued from the
Ports of the gun Deck and the Hatchways of the Spar Deck, and they
continued in the ketch along side the Frigate until the fire had communicated to her Rigging and Tops. Lieu! Decatur did not lose a
Man and had but one slightly wounded. The following is a list of the Officers, & the number of Men employed

Extract from letter to Susan Decatur, widow of Captain Stephen Decatur, Jr.,
from Hon. Littieton W. Tazewell

NORFOLK,
Sept. Yth, 1826.

MY DEARMas. DECATUR:
In reply to your letter of the 22d ult.
(which, owing, I presume, to some accident, has just been received,)
I will state to you, that during the lifetime of your late husband,
I had many conversations with him, upon the subject of his claim

upon the Government of the U. S. for the capture and destruction
of the frigate Philadelphia. The first of these conversations took place,
I think, in 1806, soon after he established himself in this place. In
this, his object was to consult me professionally as to the validity of
his claim, and as to the proper course to be adopted to obtain the payment of the amount, should I think the claim just. I then investigated
the subject very maturely, and gave him a long written opinion upon
it, in which I stated the reasons that induced me to consider it, not
only a fair claim upon this Government, but one which it was his duty
to prefer, as the guardian and protector of the officers and people
who were associated with him in this daring and honorable enterprise.
Of one thing I am very certain, that durlng the whole course of his
life, Commodore Decatur was f i d y and fully persuaded, that he,
his officers and crew, had a just claim upon the U. S. for the value of
the frigate Philadelphia, which they had captured and burnt by the
express order of them commanding officer.
I am,very respectfully and sincerely yours

LITT'NW. TAZEWELL.

[16 February 18041
To Susan Decatur, widow of Captain Stephen Decatur, Jr., from Surgeon John
Erdgely, U. 6. Navy

Annapolis, NOD.10, 1826.
MADAM:
Your letter of the 2d inst. has just been received, and I
hasten to reply to it. I have a distinct - an indelible recollection

of the leading events of our imprisonment. The Pl~chaand his court
did not attempt to conceal their exultation on the capture of the frigate
Philadelphia. I t was a jubiIee in Tripoli So extravagant were his
calculat~ons,that he would not listen to any proposal of peace and
ransom, for a less sum t h m one million of dollars. I n this condition
of affairs, it would have been impolitic to have opened a negotiation.
I t would have been regarded as an evidence of fear and imbecility.
This tone of confidence and triumph continued until the daring enterprise, led on by your gallant and lamented husband, illuminated his
castle with the blaze of his trophy. The sensation produced by the
achievement was indescribable - consternation and dismay were
depicted on every face. But the best evidence of its impression, was
the frequent conferences of the Pacha with the Consuls, his undisguised
desire to make peace, and his proposition to that effect, on terms much
more moderate - I think $200,000. The terror inspired by the recapture and conflagration, (increased by the attack of the gun-boats,
on the 3rd of August, 1804,) was felt during the war, and its influence
was acknowledged when the treaty of peace was signed.
I t may not be known to you, Madam, that I was appointed to the
Consulship of Tripoli after the war, and obtained this and other information from one of the European Consuls, with whom the Pacha often
conferred during our captivity, and to whom he confided his difficulties
and danger.
Description can convey but an inadequate idea ot the horrors of
our imprisonment. We were confined in a dungeon m the centre of
the castle, into which no air or light could find access, but through
a small iron grate in the terrace or ceiling. To privation of pure a v ,
wholesome food, &c. was added the annoyance of noxious reptiles.
The desperation of the officers may be inferred from two attempts to
escape - one by undermining, and the other by passing over the walls
of the castle. An account of these enterprises and thelr failure, may
be found in the biography of Com. Porter, published some years
since, (1815,I think,) in the Analectic Magazine and Naval Chronicle.
When any communication, between the squadron and the castle
was announced, joy and gladness were diffused through our glqorny
cells, and reiterated disappointment could not dispel the cherished
hope that the happy hour of emancipation had arrived. Even a t this
distant period, the heart sickens a t the recollection of "hope long
deferred. "
That a enerous legislature may grant this 'ust claim, is the confident belie of one who knew and appreciated the high-minded and
chivalric officer on whose services it ~sfounded.
I am,Madam, with sentiments of the highest respect and consideration, your obedient servant,

impracticable to the captors to have taken the Philadelphia out of

waa javorabb; consequently, nothing but the want of skill in the
pilot who was with them, wrts likely to have prevented such a resdt,
if it had been attempted. The brig Syren, which lay off the harbor,
would have been sufficient, to have protected her the moment that she
had cleared the port.

MY DEARMRS. DECATUR:
The re-assembling of the honorable

Congress of the United States, renders it necessary to delay no longer
answering your esteemed favor of June last, in which you request me
to state such informtation, relative to the burning of the Philadelphia,
in the harbor of Tripoli, as I may possess, in aid of your claim on our
country, for the success of that gallant enterprise, so ably and honorabl performed by your late husband. I regret that my limited
ab' 'ties disqualify me from portraying, in those glowing colors of
which that act is susceptible, the gallantry and perseverance with
which it was erformed by my late friend.
You state t a t your late husband had given you to understand that
the project of burning that frigate a t her moorings, therebv to remove
s serious impediment to the future operations of the squadron against
Tripoli, originated with him. This understanding was perfectly
correct; it did originate with your late husband, and he first volunit into effect, and asked the permission of
teered himself to c
Commodore Preble, o Tripoli, (on first discovering the frigate was
lost to the squadron,) to effect it with the schooner Enterpriee, then

under his command. The commander-in-chief thought it too hazardous to be effected in that way, but promised your late husband that the
object should be carried into effect on a proper occasion, and that he
should be the executive officer when it was done. I t was accordingly
effected in the ketch Intrepid, by your husband and 70 volunteers
from the schooner he commanded, a t great hazard, not only of life or
liberty, but that of reputation, and in the season most perilous in
approaching that coast. The recollection of the difEculties and
dangers he had to encounter in that expedition, of which I mas an eyewitness, excites more and more my admiration of his gallantry and
enterprise -and although the result shed a lustre throughout Europe,
over the American character, and excited an unparalleled emulation
in the squadron, in our country alone is .where it has never been duly
estimated, or properly understood.
Courage, and great force alone, could not have effected it. I t was
necessary not only to put the smallest possible force to the hazard,
but its success depended upon a very small force being used. The
genius and mental resources of the executive officer, could alone
compensate for the want of force and numbers. To these demands
your late husband was found fully adequate - and hence the brilliant
result. The frigate was completely destroyed, in the midst of the
enemy, and his retreat effected without the loss of a man.

esteem.

eased me of considerable uneasiness, a s I hardly h e w how to act

respecting the Cargo, of Provisions on board the f17ilEkm &Mary. The Consul to whom it came addressed and who was as fully informed
of pour wishes as I was, had given Captn Tipling instructions to unload
and had directed him to draw along side the Wharf for that purpose I conceived it my Duty to put him in mind that I thought such a
measure precipitate - and ill-advised, and wrote him as p' enclosed
Copy, he chose to reply in terms not altogether civil which you will
perceive by the transla tion oi his Letter also herewith, - I shall make
no Comment on his Conduct in this bussiness, you will see it in its
roper light, it certainly does not tell much in h ~ scommendation,^^ a
h b l i e officer who talks so much about his "indispensible duty I have agreed with Cnpt Tipling to carry the Provisions to you for
480 Dollars which I think a fair bargain and full as little as I could
have sent i t over to you by Vessels belonging to this Place, independant
of the expense of trmshi ment and the injury of removal from one
Shi to another; - The reight is made payable here as the Captam

me to provide:

which the Proprietor offers at 5 Sh91109 pr Gallon. I send you a Sample
of it, and if you choose will make the purchase for the use of the
Squadron. - The holder has promised to wait a week fol your answer;
if I receive none, I shaU of course conclude that you do not want it,
you will find the quality I believe pretty good, and 1 think the bargain

"You have doubtless long ere this heard of the loss of the Frigate
PhiZadelphia - The particulars of that most unfortunate event
which has terminated in our becoming Prisoners of War, or rather
Slaves to the Bashaw of this Regency, are briefly these - On the
morning of the 31" October last cruizing a few leagues to the Eastward of this tom, We discovered a Tripolitan Armed Ship, standing
to the Westward, to which We gave chase. She kept close in with the
land, and continued running for the town, while we kept up firing upon
her as our guns could be brought to bear. Finding, however, all our
efforts, either to compeI her to run on shore, or to cut her off from the

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS

433

town ineffectual, We gave up the pursuit and was standing off from
the land, when we suddenly run upon a reef of Rocks, with only twelve
feet of water - All the guns, except, a few to defend us against the
attacks of the Enemy's gun Boats were thrown overboard, the Anchors
cast away from the Bows, and the fore mast cut away, in order to
lighten the Ship; but every thing was unavailing - Finding all our
exertions ineffectual, convinced that no expedient had been left
unattempted that could have a possible tendency to save the Ship After having sustained the fire of the Enemy's Gun Boats for upwards
of four hours, and Our Ship so much careened over as to render the
firing of our guns inpracticable, cruel necessity Ieft no alternative but
the melancholy one, of hauling down our Colours; and the Flag of the
United States was struck to the Tripolines The treatment we received from these Savages was such as raised
our utmost indignation - Nothing was sacred or escaped their pryin
search, d l our chests, trunks, with every article of cloathing, and
our books were carried off - Our swords were snatched from us, our
pockets searched and emptied; some of us had our boots pulled off,
to examine if something was not concealed there, and some had their
very coats pulled off their backs, which the barbarians exultingly put
upon themselves, and rts if the rewards of some si a1 Exploit; seemed
to triumph in acquiring what fortune alone had o tained them Immediately on being landed, we were all conducted, amidst the
shouts and acclamations of the rabble Multitude to the Palace and
there ushered into the presence of the mighty Bashaw who seated in
state with his Council about him, and sorrounded with Guards, awaited
our coming - He asked a variety of questions rincipally concerning
our Ship and Squadron; and after having us a f paraded before him,
and taken a full survey of each of us, a t which a gracious smile appeared
upon his countenance, expressive of his inward satisfaction a t his good
fortune which by renderin us miserable had so kindly befriended
him, we were led by a Guar to the house assigned for our Prison.
Here we were left to our own reflections till the 1 . F November - On
that day, the Bashaw, for reasons best known to himself, thought
proper to remove us, and ordered that We should be conducted to the
Castle - The change indeed was rather an unpleasant one -From a
large commodious house to what they call a Castle, which in fact, was
a most loathsome prison - We were there crammed into the same
place with all our Ship's Company - How well capable of containing
such a number you may judge when I inform you that the room was
about 80 feet by 25 - How confortably when you learn that the only
place to admit the fresh air was by a small aperture in the cieling
grated over, without any floor or a single Article of furniture, so that
when fatigued standing up, we were obliged to lay down on the filthy
ground - In the Evenin the Bashaw's natural goodness reappeared
and, banishing all passion rom his mind, we were by his orders reconducted to our former abode Two nights since the Boats of one of Our Frigates came within the
ht~rbour,and burnt our ship - It was a most sublime sight, and very
gratifyin to us; we have not as yet heard the articulars - In consequence o this however, the Bashaw has redou led his vigilance of us,
and 'tis said that we are wain to be carried to the Castle

r e arrived here after a pleasant passage of five days. I have been
received by the Dey with much cordiality, and our Affairs appear
to be well here; but we are in an unsteady latitude. We find the
Country exceedingly pleasant, and as yet have no cause to complain.
I found Captain Cornick here to whoom I gave a proper lecture As he determined not to touch at Gibraltar, I did not write by
him. - The loss of the annuity Ship near Cadk is unfortunate
but we must do without her. The unfortunate loss of the Philad* & the Captivity of poor Bainbridge & his Crew at Tripoli, you are undoubtedly informed of before

all the wants and making the situation of my unfortunate Countrymen
as comfortable as could be in that state. It is an unlucky affair; but
in the end, it will, I think be attended with good effects. - It will
disconcert the plans of the Commodore, from whoom I have not
heard since he left this Bay on the 22@Novr but he will receive further
aid. (See British Affairs in letter to Capt. Bainbridge Feb? 1Z* 1804)

SIR. I had the honor to answer yours of the 4'9 on the 30t@UltQ
& enclosed you a plan of a gunboat, the price thereof, & the time i t
would take to build four on that construction, I now send you a plan
of a boat calculated to carry a 10 inch mortar a brass long 24 pounder
& a short forty two, with which I am certain you will find many faults
& 'oin with me in giving the preference to the former, both for its
u d t y & price, the latter is better calculated for inland navigation
where a current or regular tide might facilitate its operations, but I

436

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1803 TO 1804

can't think i t is a proper vessel to be on a barbarous coast which
inevitably at some periods becomes a lee shore. In my opinion the best rig for a vessel carrying a mortar is a Ketch,
such as the are now used in the British Navy which are vessels of
burthen & resistance & calculated to keep the sea in any weather,
to build such vessels here, would cost as much as it would in the United
States, & the timber would not be so good, nor the work so well done,
& for a boat to carry a mortar & a gun aft, I prefer the rig of the boat
the plan of which I have already sent you.For the enclosed plan I could devise no other rig but what is delineated as the vessel must inevitably carry two masts, & when the
mortar is play'd the foremast must be taken out & two stay sails
fitted from the mainmast head to enable the boat to hold her wind
until taken in tow by the vessel that would have her foremast on
board: for that reason 1 prefer a sliding gunter sail forward, to a
schooners, the mast being shorter & lighter, less incumber'd with
riging, & consequently easier taken in & out, but upon the whole
this plan is very inconvenient; however it can do no harm to submit i t
to your inspection & probably your superior judgement & experience
will enable you to point out some improvement which will remove
the difficulty: it ought likewise to be consider'd that in action, should
my of the larger boats be sunk we would lose a Gun & a mortar,
exclusive of the difference in the price of the boat; the former being
valued at dollars 3776 32/100 & the latter 5978 941100 so that you may
have built nine of the smaller boats for a very little more than what
five of the larger would cost. I found here four mortars the smallest was eleren inch french
measurement & weigh'd 1455 Lbs of Leghorn the other three were
12 inch & weigh'd 2720 lbs each, I should have purchased the smallest a t a risk but the[yJ being in possession of a Jew, immediately
on his being informed that I wanted them he broke them all up,
& sold them for old brass, altho the person whom I employ'd to buy
them offer'd to give him a better price than he possibly could get
else where; I presume he was affraid that if the Bashaw of Tripoli
should be inform'd that we had purchased arms from Jews that he
would make it a pretext for levying contributions on his fraternity
a t Tripoli; I have heard of none others for sale in Leghorn, if I do I
will inform you as soon as possible, I wrote to the Pounder a t Florence
on the subject, who answer'd me. that first pcrmission must be obtain'd
from the Tuscan government & that i t would take him a year to make
four ten inch mortars; & that he would settle the price when I forwarded him the design, as for balls bomb shells & ammunition, I
presume the[y] can be procured by applying to this government, as
the governor of Leghorn when I applied to him to know whether
any impediment would be placed in the way of our building & fiting
out gunboats answer'd none whatever; but on the contrary that
every facility would be given us for giving the preference to the
Port of Leghorn & that I might begin the work when ever I thought
proper. I have wrote to France & Genoa for information on the above
subjects as well as to be inform'd whether two capable men can be
procured, here I have found none that I would recommend, when I
run answer'd you shall be inform'd of the result. Should you determine to Commission me to have those boab
built & fited out here; it will be necesearg for you to inform me where

I am to procure cash, for I have none in my possession belonging
to the United States, if the Navy Agents here have any in theirs,
your bills upon them would be the best way to re-irnburse me, if not,
upon London, bills upon the United States are not all ways negociable
& never without considerable loss. Should you think proper to make any alterations, or additions to
the plans please to specify them, that a proper contract may be enter'd

station; of course no vessel to send for the clotSing. I have as much
provided, as will be wanted for the prisoners a t present, & will send
a vessel to you as soon as possible. If you could Obtain permission
to send it to Naples, I intend to go there with this Ship, for the urpose
of making some arrangements with the Iiing, & wish you coufd meet
me. It is my intention to be a t Kaples by the 30tQof next month,
but shall not remain more than five or six days. mhat think you of
a cruise for a few wecks? I am in want of a volunteer who possesses
your knowledge of the Nation we are a t war with. My Cabin &
table is a t your Service, if you incline to favour me with your compnny;
& I will engage to show you sport before the summer is out. The Philadelphia Frigate was got off the rocks without damage;
dl her guns were taken out to ffoat her close into the Bashaw's cestle,
where she was moored, her guns were then put on board, & the ship
& her batteries got in fine order: her guns were kept loaded, tompions
out, & a strong guard constantly on board. I determined from the
moment I heard of her capture, to destroy her, to prevent the conseuences of her remaining in their possession: this has been effected.
8 n the 3*Q ins" I sent Capt'! Decatur in a small ketch or bombard of
about 60 tons & 4 guns, with 70 volunteers from the squadron to

Tripoli, with orders to burn the Frigate, as she was so situated, that
she could not be brought out. Capt? Stewart in the Syren brig, was
order'd to support him with boats, & cover a retreat with the brig, by
anchoring off the harbour. On the night of the 16tWapt?Decatur
enterd the harbour of Tripoli, was hailed from the Frigate; he answered
from Malta, & the rigg of the vessel, deceived the Tripolitans, however
they were soon undeceived. Captain D - laid the ketch a long side
& in a gallant & officer like manner with his brave handful of men,
boarded against all opposition; & after a conflict of a few minutes;
carried her by the sword, without iiring a musket or pistol: then set her
on fire in every part, & she was totally consumed with all her materials:
we did not lose a man, & only one was wounded: between 20 & 30
Tripolines were killed; one large boat load made their escape; many
leapt into the sea & it is supposed a number hid themselves below, &
perished in the flames, we made but one prisoner. The conduct of
& the Officers & crew under his command, deserve the
Capt"ecatur,
highest commendation: two of their largest Corsairs, lay within half
musket shot of the Frigate, the crews of which, for some time, stood
appalled a t the intrepidity & daring of our men, but after a while, they
commenced firing on the ketch, Rt the batteries & the Bashaw's castle
did the same. This day the Nautilus sent a Maltese brig taken near Tripoly, in
a considerable
violation of the blockade, with 8 Tripoline mercht"
cargo of goods; hemp, plank,
&Obn board, she is a good prize. Your attention to Captwainbridge, & the officers, & crew who are
captives with him, does you i f i t e honor. P. S. I approve your plan for a gun boat, & wait in expectation, of

Officers and Crew were gone in the prize which I captured the 23'g

the crews of which, stood appa ed at his intrepidity and daring,
would in any Navy in Europe insure him instantaneous promotion

I now have the Pleasure to Inform you that both those vessels
returned here this day, after having executed my orders highly to my
satisfaction; Lt Decatur entered the Harbor of Tripoly in the evening
of the 16*8 Inst with the Ketch, and in the most gallant manner, laid
the frigate dong side, boarded and carried her, notwithstanding the
resistance of a large number of armed Tripolines prepared to recieve
him: after having gained compleat possession, he proceeded to fire her
with success; She was soon in a Blaze from her Birth Deck to her Tops,
and is totally destroyed with all her materials: during the Operation
the Batteries and Bashaw's Castle kept up a constant fire: The Frigate
had all her guns, 40, mounted and loaded, and was in good Order. Cap.! Decatur did not lose a man and had but one wounded: The
Tripohes had between twenty and thirty killed: Not a musket or
Pistol was fired on our side, every thing by the sword and tomawhawk.
We made one prisoner I t is presumed some Tripolines perished in
the flames, and many drowned: I am preparing for another Expedition

SIR I have the honor to address you on the change of our treat-

(COPY)

ment which we have experienced since the burning of the Friaate, and
presuming that it is owing to that circumstance, I take the eberty of
mentioning, that it was an occurrence which His Excellency oukh]t
naturally to have expected from the fate of War. To have made the
attempt required no information further than what the Commodore
must have got, by seeing her when he was off here in December last:
the probability of such a thing, must have been obvious to every one,
from the distance she laid from the shore. H a v y stated to you that
i t required no information to the Commodore an the natural expectation of such an event, I trust His Excellency, will see that it was not
owing to any information from myself and Officers, who were confined
until eight days before it happened; in which period not a letter was
wrote, or could have reached the Commodore and had we every
liberty of the Town, it would be impossible for us to give any information respecting its strength &c. more than what the Commodore must
already be in possession of from Consul Cathcart, and various channels The numerous Guard we are surrounded with, is entirely unnecessary. The Walls of the City are suscient barriers to our making the attempt of etting away, and you Sir, have a much stronger
bind on us, than a1 the Guards that can be placed. Our Parole of
Honor, that no Officer dare to break ij kept on the part of the Government to whom it is given. Preventing our sending letters to our friends,
is a restraint to us, without the least benefit to his Excellency, as it
is entirely out of our Power to give any information; and could we,
prudence would forbid it. And you may be assured that the Commodore or his Officers will never write to us any thing which requires
secrecy for fear of the letters being detected: as a proof of this, the
Commodore mentioned to me in his last letter that he would not be
off here before May or June, therefore from correspondence no injury
can arise to Tripoly. The letters to and from our Families & friends
will be the on1 consolation we can receive in our ca tivity.
had proofs of t e humanity of your heart, I feel confi ent that throug
your Interest of this indulgence, we shall not be deprived - Myself
and Officers are fully sensible of your friendly disposition towards us.
Permit me to remark that no change of treatment to us, can prevent the Commodore's acting in every Warlike manner, so long as our
respective Countries are a t War, His Excellency will find the Americans
true friends in time of Pertce, but active Enemies in War.

Morocco

TANGIER
22G Feby 2804.

DEAR
SIRThe want of interesting matter to impart has been the
cause of my not addressing ou before now, - better that than the
reverse in this part of the dorld. - All the Emperours Vessels remain in Winter Quarters, and the Meshowla in same state at Larach.I had flattered myself my troubles with that Vessel were over -

but the Tsipoline Captain and two of his Countrymen who embarked
as Passengers a t Tunis have represented to His Majesty that they
lost in money and Merchandize on board of that Ship to the amount
of $1440%.
A special Messenger was sent by the Minister with an Official
Representation to me on the subject, and by Command requiring
me to obtain satisfaction to those people. I answered the Letter fully stateing the reasons for my believing
the claim unfounded, and I have not hitherto heard any more on
the matter. - Agreeabl to your wish I sollicited the release of
Arraez Omar of Tetuan rom his dismal confinement and obtained
it. - The old man has repeatedly expressed his great thankfulness,
both to you and me; - he pretends to regret the mentioned Tripolines
should have informed the Emperour that he had a tooth beat out on
board the Meshouda, for he declares from gratitude he never would
have mentioned the circumstance himself. As I was also called upon to satisfy Omar for this injury, it became
my duty to make some enquiry into the matter and I find he accuses
a M' Bellet as the person who gave him the blow, which I have mentioned to the Secretary of State. Omar goes farther and says that in the presence of Captain Smith
and Lieu! Cox, he gave up what money he had on board the it4eshowla,
which has not been returned to him. This charge against an Officer appears of too serrious a nature to be
mentioned to Government, untill those Gentlemen who have been
named as Witnesses to the fact can be heard on the subject. - As
the satisfaction Justice requires should be made to Omar, if his representation be true, is not pressed upon me; I had thought of deferring
any enquiry until1 I should have met Captain Smith; but ns its
uncertain when that may happen, I have to request you will hear
from that Gentleman what he knows on subject of Omw having
delivered a certain sum of money as he has represented: - should
that be found to be the case, then it will remain with him who rccieved
it to shew when it was returned to Omar. - It has proved matter
of regret the New York did not remain here a sufficient time to admit
of a more formd delivery of that ill fated Ship, than took place. - I
have not heard from Government since the arrival of that Ship and
the ,John Adam Frigate at Washington, but I have the highest satisfaction in congratulating you and myself on the proofs we have already
seen of The Presidents approbation of the conditions on which the
reconciliation with this Country was effected. You will have heard the Gun Carriages for the Emperor have been
sent out and that they have met another stoppage a t LIOrient, however that I hope will be but momentary. It is still my intention to visit the Ports of this Country as far as
Mogadore in April next, as I conceive a t all but particularly a t the

WARS WITR BARBARY POWERS

latter I shall find necessary to make additions or alterations in the
Instructions to my Agents; the propriety of which can best be determined when on the spot. - I trust you may find it consistent with
other Services to allow either a Frigate or one of the Brigs to visit
Mogadore beginin of May, for the reasons were explained between
us; and I will s o i c i t a assage back to this Port in her from the
Captain, as the heats w$ then hare become too much to render a
land Journey pleasant. The Emperour ip a t Morocco and most probably will remain there
some Months. I am now a t the 25t? Feb? the Schooner mizen has a t last reached

SIR, As it is probable you may hear various accounts of the capture and destruction of the Tripolitan Frigate late the United States
Frigate Philadelphia in the Harbour of Tripoly, I beg leave to mention the transactions relative to that affair. On the 3rd inst I sent
the Ketch Intrepzd of 4 Guns, with 11 Officers, and 59 Seamea and
Marines, under the command of L' Decatur, to Tripoly with orders to
burn the Frigate. The Syren Brig accompanied her to anchor off the
Harbour, send in her Boats to assist, and cover the retreat of the
Ketch. The weather was unfavourable until the night of the 16tQ
Ins! when they arrived, the Brig took her position, and the Retch
entered the Harbour - Was hailed from the Batteries and Frigate Answered from Malta and the rig of the Vessel deceived the enemy
until she was alongside the Frigate; they were then fatally undeceived.
Lieu! Decatur boarded with his Men, and carried her after a short
conflict in which upwards of 20 Tripolines were killed on the Decks One large Boat load made their escape, some ran below & probably
perished in the flames; and many jumped overboard. As soon as
complete possession was gained, she was set on fire, and totally destroyed. All her Guns were mounted and loaded; and two of their
Corsairs lay within half Musket shot of her. As soon as she was in
flames, the Batteries, Bashaw's Castle and Corsairs commenced firing
on the Ketch. One Cannon shot passed through her Top Gall1 sail
was all the damage
We did not lose a man, and had only

The same Night to the Eastward of Tripoly, in sight of the burning
of the F r i ~ a t e .the United States Schooner Nautilus fell in with a
Merchant Brig' from Malta, named the &ocisfisso, Fortunata Barbara
Master, bearing one of the pass orts which I left with you; but the
Master in direct violation of t I? at passport, and of the Blockade,
had taken on board Hemp, Linens, Plank, Building Stone &c%nd
8 Tripoline Passengers in consequence of which, she was detained and
sent to this port. The captain says he was bound to Gerbi, but
his being met with in sight of Tripoly to the Eastward of the Town,
and standing for that Harbour, with Tripoline passengers on board,

and having a passport from Malta to Tripoly, forbids a belief of

their property with impunity. I am confidant this transaction is
without your sanction, and without your knowledge. The Captain
deserves to suffer, and I certainly shall make prize of his Vessel and
Cargo. I have however sent her to Malta that the business may

SIR,I arrived here last evening. My reason for making this port
was, the wind blowing hard from the Westward I could not carry a
sufficiency of Sail to hold my own. I have seen a letter from Mr
Gavino to Mr Pulis informing him that a Danish Vessel was boarded
by a Tripolitan Cruiser between the Islands of Sicily & Sardinia on

SIR,Favoured with an opportunity by the Reynard, I am sorry to

inform you, that on the Night of the 24th off Goza I was run on Board
by the P o r t 3 4 a y , the ship under my charge, & received some damage
in the loss of my Main Boom, Boat Davids & some damage to the
Stern, the Boat was compleatly lost & the h4ain Boom broke short
about one third, which makes it impossible to Fish it, & conceiving it
a sacrafice to cut the Philadelphia's Main Yard for the purpose, I have
obtained a Spar suitable from the Publick Stores. I arrived a t t b
place with the Ship a t 4 Oclock in the morning after the accident,
which was effected by his running on board me while layin too, he
being under full sail & in the act, of veering. The Boom wi be compleat this evening at 4 the other dammages, I shall repair a t sea; mithout any expence. Thc day after leaving Syracuse, the Winds were
verry light & round the Compass, since which it has blown heavy from
W. N. W. & continues so to do still which detains both Cap! Decatur
$ myself - He arrived yesterday afternoon. The Ship has sustained no other loss than her Jibb Boom & C a t Head.

SIR.I have had the honor to receive your letter of the 23Qinclosing
Mr Eaton's petition with sundry documents respecting t,he subject
of it. The inclosed copies of two letters from this Department to
the Auditor of the Treasu
and of those to which they are answers
will manifest the course \%ch the three items of his claim now in
question have heretofore taken in the Executive Offices. I t will also
appear from them that the two first items (viz, the demurrage of the
Anna Maria,and the charge made for the Ship Gloria) have been

458

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1803 TO 180.4

-

referred to the Auditor for his decision, and that the last item, viz,
a sum of money alledged to have been extorted from MF Eaton by
the Minister of the Bey of Tunis, was rejected as, under all the circumstances of the case, not admissible under any proper exercise of
the discretion vested in the Executive. This determination was
guided by the consideration that the claim was rather for an indemnity for a loss sustained in his private & mercantile concerns, re resented as brought upon him by the course of his public Agency, t i a n
for compensation for services rendered or reimbursement of money
paid in the exercise of his office; and on this account as well as the
absence, from the nature of the case, of full and formal proof of the
fact of extortion, it was thought to be better adapted for the interposition of the Legislature, whose power of dispensing relief in peculiar
cases, like the present, is less circumscribed than that of the Executive.
With respect to the claim for the Anna Man'a, it will be sufficient
to observe, that it has been unreservedly referred to the Auditor for
his decision upon the merits, with a communication of the documents
deemed necessary for its elucidation, and that on this account it
might be considered premature or irregular for me to anticipate his
decision. Permit me therefore to suggest that on a communication
with him the Committee may obtain such information as may enable
t,hem to form a just opinion respecting it, should it be requisite to
bring it into their deliberation, circumstanced as it is a t present. I t
will be observed that the Auditor has been instructed to consider the
GZom'a as a Vessel retained for giving and receiving intelligence; and
accordingly to settle her hire at a reasonable rate for the period she
may have been actually employed in such service. Should however
the footing on which this part of his claim has been placed be deemed
by M: Eaton narrower than he conceives substantial justice to demand,
i t will remain with Con ess to provide such more extensive relief as
they may judge equitab e; it being my opinion for reasons analogous
to some of those stated above in relation to the indemnit claimed
for the extortion by the Beys Minister, that Congress are a one competent for such a mode of relief, and this opinion is more strongly
confirmed by the negative decision made upon the claim at the Navy
Department, where it was presented for settlement in the shape of
an incident to the Naval establishment.

28'h February 1804.SIR I have had the honour to receive original and duplicate of the
Letter you wrote me the 31" October last year with postscripts of
4@ & 10tQNovem! - The former was delivered me 22@this Month
by Mr William Thorn, together with Charter party of the Schooner
Citizen and Bill of lading for One hundred Gun Carriages by that
Vessel, destined as a Present from the United States to His Imperial
Majesty Muley Soliman. - The several Letters I trust you will
have received from me subsequent to that of the 5th Septemr, will
have advised the accommodation of the differences had arisen with
this Country on such a footing as left me no room to hesitate at the
immediate delivery of these Gun Carriages. I n consequence I lost no time in dispatchin an Express for Morocco
with advice to the Emperour of their arrivaf which will no doubt be
highly satisfactory to him: at recei t of the answer I will have the
honour of transmitting to you trans ation thereof, together with cop
of the Letter I wrote His Majesty on the occasion. - Captain Hu 1
in the Argw i8 here to give assistance in landing the Cargo of the

P

461

Citizen and if Weather permits it d be all on shore tomorrow. - I
must beg leave to express my regret a t those Carriages not having
been sent all of the natures the Emperour expressed a wish to have; The twelve pounders can be but of little use to him, as the Batteries
thro'out his Empire are almost all mounted with Guns of 24 $ 18.
I must also mention the whole yet landed being for Sea Service and
the circumstance of but one handspike sent for each Carriage. - To
remedy the latter mistake in the person who was encharged with
Shipment of the Stores, I have written M: Gavino to endeavour to
procure a hundred more of the suitable sizes, which I shall deliver
into the Kings Stores so soon as I get them, to prevent any unpleasant
remarks on a matter of so trifling a value. - Carriages for Sea
Service having been sent in place of those suitable for land Batteries
I fear may not be so easily got over; however as happily they have
none other of same make for Land Service in the Country, I may be
rtble to keep them satisfied with what they have got. By 59 71 you will have seen the unpleasant busyness agitated
respecting losses pretended to have been sustained by Passengers on
board the Meshouda. - I sent back the Messenger came to me, on the
fourth of January and urged every argument I thought would have
weight against the claims set up, since when I have not heard any
farther on the subject. Arraez Omar of Tetuan has referred me to Capt? Smith & Lieu$
Cox as eridences to part of his loss. - As it appears highly necessary
to come at the truth of the facts alledged by these people, I have
requested of Commodore Preble to hear what the former of these
Gentlemen knows respecting Omars story, on receiring his answer I
shall conceive it my duty to lay the whole of the information I shall
then be possessed of, before you. - If it be found the people have
lost their property, it m i l l remain for the Wisdom of Government to
find a means of redress and if on the contrary (as I much wish) the
allegations prove to be false, I am satisfied the Emperour will punish
those within his power. - A very small present for His Majesty has
at last arrived from Holland by the way of Lisbon - as it consists only
in twelve Cases, two C e s b and a Bale there can be but little hopes of
its proving equal to expectation. - The Consul is encharged with the
Negotiation and waits His Majestys Commands for going to Morocco
immediately or not; - in the mean time he has desired permission of
our [the Emperor's] Governour (at present at Tetuan) to send his
Family to Europe, to which no answer has been returned, and I have
reason to beleive it will not be granted. T h e n the Emperour went to Morocco he appointed Sidy hluhammed Selatvy Bashaw of the Province of Beni Hassan with residence a t
Sulle, encharged also with the Government of that Town. [NA. SD.4. CL, Tangier, \ 01. 2, ,Tan 1803-Oct. 1SlO.I

Interesting as the former year was. The interuption our Trade to this Country met with in September,
has no doubt been some cause of the very great differences, but a t
all times (I still think) we shall only see occasional Speculations
take place, as for the reasons mentioned a regular Commercial intercourse between the Countries cannot be hoped for on a grand scale. As the Port of Mogadore will undoubtedly continue to enjoy the
chief part of whatever Trade may be carried on by the Citizens of
the United States in this Country, I have considered that it may
be well to visit that Port myself, when I can be best able to judge
of the Regulations most proper to be established for the Masters &
Merchants arrivin there. However I shal? not take any decisive resolution on the matter,

Algeciras Bay, 9March 1804
SIR, After I had put my Letter to you of the 10" FebP on board
the Convoy for Malta, a Vessel arrived here from the Eastward,
which brought information, of his having been boarded of[f] Sardenia,
by a Tripolitan Cruizer, carrying 8 Guns, and Sixty or Seventy Men,
I made all the dispatch I could, and sailed on the
the Eastward, with a Ship belonging to New Pork, under Convoy, bound to
mcant. We had a fair wind as far as Cape de Gatt, where we took the wind
from the Eastward, and beat from there to the Bay of Allicant,
passing near Cape Pallos On my arrival a t Allicant, I found there American Vessels bound
down, and as I could not gain the least information there, of any
Cruizers having been seen on that station, and fearing that something might arrive a t Gibralter, which would make it necessary for
me to be there, I thought it best to return, with the Ships bound down,
taking a good look off Cape PaJlos, & Cape de Gatt in my way. I arrived at Gibralter on the 24" in the morn8 and found that the
Schooner [Citizen] with the Gun Carriages had been there, and sailed
for Tangier in distress for want of men, his Mate having been pressed,
and one or two of his Seamen Sick - on gaining this information
from Mr Gavino, and finding that there were not any Vessels in the
Bay bound to the Eastward, I sailed the same Evenin for Tangier,
to assist the Captain of the Schooner, in delivering %is Cargo After remaining in Tangier four days, and findin that I could be of
no further use to the Schooner, I sailed for this ay, leaving a Midshipman and two men to assist the Captain in Ballast5 his Vessel,
and to come over with him. The Moors are very much leased with the Gun Carriages, and are
remarkably attentive to our ag a t present, the Governor made us a
present of two Bullocks, a few Fowls, Bread &$ and suffered us to
take away, what Stock we pleased. You d not be a t a loss, to know the reason of my anchoring on
this side, as you will know the inconvenience of being much a t Gibralter,. tho' I have escaped so far, without any thing happening worth
notice. I have the disagreeable task to inform you, that 1 have been obliged
to arrest Lieutenant Livingston for the enclosed charges, brought
against him by Lieutenant Blake, and wish you to give me Orders
concerning him, he wishes very much to go to America, but I s h d
detain him until I hear from you - I have likewise four or five men

whether any of the Frigates, have began to t out for this Station,

CITIZENGENERALI have the honor of enclosing a letter addressed
to you, which I found on board the prize Martingana called the
hlastico, as likewise a declaration of the Blockade of Tripoly, which I
beg you to present to the Captain Pacha.
I wish him to understand that our object in Blockading that port,
is to distress an Enemy who has made War on the commerce of the
United States of America without any cause except those founded on
avarice and injustice, and that this measure, is of the first importance
in compelling them to a peace that may be consistant with the honor
and dignity of our Country.
The Bearer of this, is an Officer of the Captain Pacha who was
passenger in the said prize called the Mastico as it is possible that his
Government may attach blame to him from the circumstance of his
being in the Vessel I feel it a duty incumbent on me to declare that
from enquiry and observation his conduct as an Officer, and Gentleman, reflects great honor on his Nation

UNITEDSTATESSHIP Constitution
Harbour oJ Syraezlse 4th March 1804
CITIZEN GENERAL
Presuming on the good faith & friendship
existing between the French Republic and the United States of
America, and owing to our having no Ambassador or Consul a t the
Porte, I venture to ask your mediation in an affair which, if misrepresented, might bring us into collision with a power whom we are,
and still wish to continue in Peace and friendship with. - reposing the
fullest confidence in your well wishes for us, I beg leave to submit to
you, the following statement of facts, earnestly hoping, that you will
avail yourself of the earliest opportunity to make them known to the
Captain Pacha, or the proper Department a t Constantinople and to
impress on their minds the truth of this our complaint and the
attendant consequences of such a flagrant violation of the laws of
Nations and Humanity.
On the 29th of October last the United States Frigate Philadelphia,
then cruising alone off the Harbour of Tripoly ran on the rocks near
that place. the consequences of this misfortune were, that she was
attacked by Gun Boats, and other Vessels, then laying in the Harbour, and the Frigate careening so much, as to render her Guns useless
she was obliged to surrender. Among the Vessels which acted in a
hostile manner towards our Flag on this occasion, was the Martingana
called Mastico commanded by Mustapha Rais of Candia who was in
the Harbour of Tripoly under Turlush Colours which on this occasion
he does not scruple to haul down, and hoist the Tripoline flag. He
then proceeded to the attack, and was actually the person who first
boarded the Philadelphia plundered and abused the Officers, and
afterwards conducted them as prisoners to the Bashaw's Castle.
Thus was the Crew of one of our Frigates made prisoners by the
assistance of a Vessel belonging (as is said) to the Captain Pacha, in
which case she certainly ought to have been sailing under a friendly
flag. Surely such an infrin ement when truly represented to the
Government a t Constantinop e, will meet their prompt consideration,
and that they will readily subscribe to a punishment tantamount to
the aggression I can have no doubt.
On the 23'q December last as I was cruising off Tripoly I fell in with
the aforesaid Martingana commanded by the said Mustapha Rais.
The crew consisted of 7 Greeks, and 3 Cretans (Turkish subjects.)
There was also on board as passenger a Chouix of the Captain Pacha
(who is now on his way home to Constantinople) and between 50 and
60 Tripolines and Slaves belon ing to the Bashaw of Tripoly and his
subjects. She was from Tripo y bound to Bengaza, and from thence
to Constantinople. I sent her into port for further examination and
just a t the moment I was about discharging the Vessel Captain and
Crew, I was informed of these important circumstances, which left me
no alternative, but to make prize of her, as the Captain and the three
Cretans, stand convicted of Piracy in the fullest extent of the word,
and as such I am constrained to treat them, until I am advised by the
Captain Pacha, whether or not this Captain Mustapha was sailing
under Turkish Colours, and with his orders. If this is really the case,
the Captain Pacha will doubtless decree that Mustapha Rais, and
his associates have merited death, But I have a strong suspicion,

f

f

that this Vessel and Captain was commissioned by the Bashaw of
Tripoly, and shall wait the Captain Pacha's advice on this subject
with im atience
I enc ose you the deposition of the Chouix of the Captain Pacha,
who was passenger in the Vessel; as also the depositions of several of
the Crew, which prove the facts beyond doubt. After this brief statement Citizen General I beg leave to assure you, that the interest you
may take in this affair, will not only insure my gratitude but that of
my Country Accept my cordial wishes for your health and happiness,

I t appears by letters from Commodore Preble to the Navy Department that he had proclaimed the port of Tripoli to be in a state of
blockade, on the grounds and in the form of British proclamations,
used in cases where no effective blockade had taken place. That
this measure may not be cited against the principle of blockades
maintained by the United States, it is pro er you should know that
no instruction was given to the American ommander to that effect,
and that the instructions since transmitted him will set and keep
him right on that subject.
From a letter lately received by this Department from Mr Jarvis
our Consul a t Lisbon, it appears that he has fallen into an error on
another subject which might tend to mislead the British Government
in their estimate of our principles and policy with respect to their
claim of seamen serving in vessels of the United States. In a spirit
of liberality he signified to a British Naval Commander a t Lisbon
that in order to prevent a resort to impressment by British Commanders,
he was willing, on roper application to deliver seamen from american
vessels, who sho d appear to be British subjects. You too well

know the principles maintained by the United States on this subject
to be at a loss in repelling any inference that may be drawn from this
circumstance, or from any others, in favor of a claim which can be

Vessel arrived from the Eastward, the Cap! of which brought information of his having been boarded off Sardenia, by a tripolitan Buizer,
carrying 8 Guns, and Sixty or Seventy men. - I lost no time in getting
a discription of the Vessel, and preparing the Argus for Sea, and sailed
on the 14@in pursuit of her, with the ship Actress of New York, under
my Convoy, bound to Micant - We had a fair wind as far as Cape
de Gatt, where we took the Wind from the Eastg, and beat from there
to the Bay of Allicant, passing near Cape Pallos,
On my arrival at Micant, I found three American Vessels bound to
the Westward, and as I could not gain, the least information, of any
Cruizers having been seen on that station, and fearing that something
might arrive a t Gibraltar, that would make it necessary for me to be
there, I thought it adviseable to return, with the Ships bound down,
taking a good look off Cape Pallos snd Cape de Gatt in my way,
I arrived at Gibralter, on the 24@in the Morning, and found that the
Schooner Gtizen, had been there, with the Gun Carriages, and sailed
for Tangier, in distress for want of men, his mate having been pressed,
and one or two of his Seamen Sick, on gaining this information from
MF Gavino and finding that there was not any Vessels in the Bay,
bound to the Eastward, I sailed the same Evening for Tangier, to
assist the Captain of the Schooner in delivering his Cargo. - After
remaining in Tangier four days, and finding that I could be of no
further use there, the Gun Carriages being nearly delivered, I sailed
for this Bay, leaving a Midshipman and two men, to assist in Ballasting the Schooner, and to come over with her to Gibralter. - The
morning I left Tangier, came on a most violent G d e of wind, which
obliged me to run through the Straight, and lay by until the followin
morning, when the wind became more moderate - I beat up, an
Anchored here in the Afternoon. - I have been this moment informed,
by the health Boat, that his Britanic Majestys Brig M'eazle, was lost
in the Gale, on Caberitta Point, and that several Vessels had drove
from their Anchors a t Gibralter, and was obiiged to go to sea Amongst the Number two Americans, but I have not as yet been able
to learn their names. - I t is my intention to fill up my water a t
this place, and then run over to Gibralter, and take on board a supply
of Provisions, and if no application is made for Convoy, I shall again
take a look off Ca e de Gatt, and Cape Pallos, and hope, should any

March 5th 1804
"DEAR WADSWORTH,
Since the burning of the Frigate we have
been removed & close confined in an apartment of the castle, but the
Minister granted us permission to write our Friends and he has
promised to forward our lettefs after he has perused them. With
respect to the capture of the Frigate I shall only observe that we were
in pursuit of one of their cruizers, after giving over chace & in the
act of hauling off shore going about 8 h o t s we grounded on a reef of
rocks laying about 3 miles from shore. Her bows were in 12 feet
water & her lee gun deck ports on a level with waters' edge: every
exertion was made to get her off & every seamanlike expedient tried
to but without effect - at first all was hove aback & all the guns run
aft: then Most of the guns hove overboard, all the water started in
the hold & pumped out: the Anchors cut from the bows, & as a last
effort the Foremast was cut away to lighten her forward but without
effect. - The enemies gun boats in the mean time took their station
on our starboard Quarter & commenced a well directed fire at our
masts and rigging, they lay in such a situation that not one of our
guns could be brought to bear on them not withstanding we cut away
part of our stern.
all endeavors to defend the ship useless Capt Bainbridge
very coo ly & prudently call'd a council of his officers who were
unanimously of opinion that to save the lives of the Brave crew there
was no alternative but to haul the colors down & with tears in his
eyes did that truly brave man submit to the painful necessity: previous to hauling the colors down we did everything in our power
to disable the ship.
"Rest satisfied that no exertions were wanting to get her off nor
could courage avail anything - their getting her off was more the
effects of fortune than any exertions on their part - 48 hours after
the unfortunate event a fresh N W gale arose which rais'd the waters
on this coast with a heavy swell which hove her off the reef. After
we struck our colors finding they did not come to take possession of
the ship Capt B sent me in the Barge to tell the enemy they might

476

take possession as we should make no further resistance, this probably has given rise to the story you mention. When an investigation
takes place I feel confident the American character will suffer nothing
from this accident. Present my best respects to my old shipmates &
your Brother Officers and accept assurances of high respect & esteem
from your unfortunate but aft'ectionate Friend, D. PORTER.

Naples
SIR The commander in chief of the United States Squadron
stationed in the Mediterranean, having established his head quarters
a t Syracuse in Sicily, iinding it absolutely necessary to join to his
squadron four Gun & four Mortar Boats, and being informed that at
Palermo and Messina there are some belonging to His Sicilian Majesty
exactly calculated for the service on which he intends to employ
them, has requested me under date of the 31st January to proceed to
Naples to request permission from the Government to purchase the
said Boats which are not at present in actual service; or if more
agreeable, he promises either to have others built in their place, or to
return them in at least as good condition as he receives them, should
the Government of Kaples not think proper to alienate them entirely.
Deeming it inexpehent to make so long a journey before I was
informed of the probability of success, I have taken the liberty to
address Pour Excellency on the subject being encouraged thereto by
the very polite reception the Ofhers of the American Squadron have
always received from you at Kaples, and the consideration that His
Sicilian Majesty being engaged in a War with all the Barbary States
by our Squadron frequenting his Coasts & Harbours, and destroying
the Cruisers of any one of those states, is in reality promoting the
Welfare of his subjects, by giving security to their persons and property, and lessening the risk of navigating under the Neapolitan flag.
I have requested John Matthiew Esqr our Consul at Naples to
present this to Your Excellency, and to await your answer, which by
your influence I have reason to believe will be in the affirmative.
Mr Matthiew will be directed to procure the necessary order for their
delivery to Edward Preble Esqr Commander in chief of the U S
Squadron stationed in the Mediterranean when he finds it convenient
to call or send for them, and to forward it to him at Syracuse.
If we should be so happy as to succeed in this our request the
Government of the United States will take a singular pleasure in
acknowledging the favor, and Commodore Preble or myself will
proceed to Naples in order to enter into any contract with that
Government on the part of the United States of America that the
circumstance may require.

On or about the 17th Ulto. anchored in the road of Gouletta
a corsair of Barbary, said to be an Algerine, it wm but a few days
since, that she was discovered to be a Tripolitan, who came here for
supplies. On its being made known, she was immediately ordered
away by the Veckil - contrary winds, and want of Provisions have
detained her. I have advized the Enterprize getting under weigh in
order to avoid her detention on the part of the Government (agreeable to Treaty) as I have this moment received an order to appear
at the Palace, and suspect this to be one of the objects. His Excellency has been pointedly peevish of late, and apprehend that my
morning visit, will renew the history of his complaints.

DEARSIR, I am infinitely obliged to thee for the leasing intelligence
of the gallant action of Captain Decatur a t Tripo y and as I am convinced that i t will give great pleasure to the Inhabitants of this
Island, I shall take the liberty of giving a translation of it in the
Gazette of this City. I shall also send a copy of it to General Acton,
confident that it will meet with thy approbation. Atchievments of
this nature cannot be too well known; it will have a good effect on the
Court of Naples, and may give courage to this Government. A
Neapolitan Squadron of 2 Frigates and 2 Cutters arrived yesterday
from Naples, and i t is said they are to be joined by another Frigate
refitting in this port, but what the object of this expedition is, I
know not.
Numerous reports have been spread about the sailing of the French
Fleet from Toulon, but I have reason to believe that none of them
are true.
Lord Neilson with his squadron was seen off Minorco eleven days
ago,
B the hands of Lt Comt J: H: Dent, I had the honor of receiving
thy Iktter of the 8@Ulto: and waited immediately upon His Excellency
the Governor Guillechini to see if I could procure the Gun Boats
kc' but he had no authority to dispose of them without previous
orders from the Court of Naples either by sale or otherwise.
He the Governor as well as the Marquis Ospley [?I Minister of the
Marine to whom I also spoke on the subject, promised to do every
thing in their Power to assist any of the ships of the S uadron under

The United States of America's Frigate Philadelphia having unfortunateIy struck on the rocks off Tripoly in Barbary, the 31st of
October last was attacked by Armed Vessels and Boats, and from
the situation of the Ship, was obliged to surrender. Among the
Armed Vessels which made prize of the Frigate and prisoners of the
Crew, was the Martingana called Mastico commanded by Mustapha
Rais of Candia which Vessel it is said, belonged to your Excellency.
She was in the port of Tripoly under Turkish Colours, when the
accident happened, but immediately hauled them down, and hoisted
the Tripoline fla took on board a number of Tripolines armed with
Muskets and sa res, and went out to the attack; Anchored near
the Frigate, and as soon as she surrendered Mustapha Rais with
his men, boarded the Frigate, made her a prize, and took the Captain
& Officers &c* as Prisoners Plundered and abused them, and conducted them to the Bsshaw of Tripoly. Thus by the Piratical
interference of the Vessel of a friendly Nation, was the crew of one of
our Frigates made prisoners of. A true representation of that transaction will be made to you, by the English and French Ambassadors
residing a t your Court; and I hope and expect from the friendship B:
respect which the Government of the United States of America have
for the Grand Seignior, and the Ottoman Nation that it will please
him to ant us that Justice for which he is so renowned by ordering
the Bas aw to surrender up to me, the Officers and Crew of the Frigate,
and by punishing in an exemplary manner those of his subjects who
were concerned in this flagrant violation of the law of Nations. The

ever to remain so. The friendly interference of the Grand Seignior,

Harbour of Malta 1l t h of Illarch 180.4 .SIR,I had the honor to forward you two setts of Dispatches by
the way of Gibraltar, under date the 3rd and 19th Ulto by different
vessels, and now forward you Triplicates of the same I experienced
many inconvei~iencesfrom having so many Prisoners on board, as
thcir want of attention to cleanliness a s injurious to the health of
my Crew; and they occupied more room, than 1 could spare.
no Prison-Ship, I applied to the Keapoli tan Government, and obtain
permission to Land t h ~ r na t Syracuse, and deposit them in their
Castles which per,~ssion,I hare availed myself of. I have howex-er
kept on board Eight of the Principal Officers, who are of too much
conse uence to be trusted out of our sight. 1 expect to recover

for the principal one.

they cannot navigate these seas with safety before that time, revious
to which, it will be necessary for me to go to Naples in t 's ship,
to OfEcer, Mann, and Convoy them to the Coast of Tripoly, but shaU
delay no time, and my rout to, and from there, will be the best cruising
ground to fall in with Enemy's Cruisers, if they should have any
out. There are now in this Port, three Tunissian Frigates from 24 to
32 Guns; and one of 32 Guns, and a number of Xebecks, Polacres,
and other War Vessels a t Tunis, fitting in all possible haste for sea;
the object is hinted to be the American Commerce I verily believe
against us. &lY whole
that i t is the intention of Tunis to make
Squadron consisting only of two Brigs and three Schooners, is quite
inadequate to carry on the Blockade of Tripoly, &- watch the coast
of Morocco & Tunis; not only so, but i t will be dangerous for our
small Vessels to separate for the protection of our Trade, as the Tunissians may be too strong for any force that I can detach a t present. It
will be politic, and for our Interest to send out a sufficient force a t
Once to quell thcse Barbuims If I had two Frigates more here, and
the Brig Argus, I would engage to have Peace with Tri olg on our
own terms before July and to keep the Tunissians in fufl check. I
wish you would send me out Eight 32 pound Carronades for the Upper
Deck of the Constitution; they will be much wanted in case of a War
with Tunis and Algiers, which we ought to be prepared for. I also
want six 12 pound carronades for our Boats, the Carriages Worms,
Rammers, Spunges, & Shot &c*should be complete for all the Carronades, as they cannot be procured here unless at an enormous price.
1 expect to spend a large quantity of Powder in Fire Ships, and Infernals to blow up the Bashaw's Works, of course it will be well to send
me 100 Barrels of Powder by Lhe first Vessel of War that comes out.
If I had a vessel to spare, I would send to Alexandria to bring down
the Bashaw of Tripoly's Brother, and put him in possession of Derne
and Bengaza immediately, from thence he could march to Tripoly,
and with our assistance take it; as d the Arabs of the Country are
in his favour. I am in hopes the arrival of some additional force to
our little Squadron will enable me to do this before the season is so
far advanced as to dry up the S rings, and prevent the march of
Tmops from Egypt to Bengaza & bipolypolg,
Our Commerce in the Mediterranean zs immensely valuable, and
daily increasing; and should the War continue between the European
Powers, we may engross nearly the whole business by k e e p 3 up a
respectable force, to protect our Vessels. I hope we never sha consent to pay Tripoly for Peace or Tribute; and should Tunis make
War that we never shall have Peace with them but on the same terms.
If we are now too economical with our Kaval force, i t will only lead
to greater expences in future. I only want the means to b ' them
to a proper sence of their situation, and it shall be done; b u z a sufficient force is not sent out immediately the consequences may be
serious, as i t regards our Commerce.
One of the Tunissian Cruisers which arrived here a few days since,
was met at Sea by the Syren Cap$Stewart and refused either to aeqd
a Boat on board, or to allow him to send one to them; or to exhibit
any passports. The force was so nearly equal, that Captain Stewart
did not think proper to attempt to enforce the
of being satisfied,

have suffered her to pass without asserting the right our Treaty gives
us, of examining Passports, as Tripoline Vessels often visit Tunis,
and wear similar Colours to the Tunissian Vessels. You may rely
with confidence that I shall do all in my power to protect our Commerce, and punish those ~ ~ infringe
h o
on our rights. I hope I shall
not be accused of a want of Prudence i n the measures I adopt.
When I was last a t Syracuse, I recd a letter from a Mr Barnes,
dated at Leghorn, who subscribes himself Consul of the United States
for Sicily. I find from enquiry that he was appointed about two ears
since, but I believe has not been in Sicily a resident in the Is and.
We have a wretched Vice Consul in each of the ports of that Island,
who cannot speak a word of English, and who have no respectability
attsched to them. I am told they have purchased their Offices a t
Naples, a t from 270 to 500 Dollars each; they are of no service, and
disgrace the uniform of our Navy by
in the most ridiculous
own Country Men as well as
a respectable representative a t Naples, a Man of inJEwnce by which
means we should at all times have every facility in procuring whatever we may want for our operations against the Barbary Powers.
Would it not be for the Interest of our Country [to] have a Minister
Plenipotentiary or an Ambassador at the Ottoman Porte? Such a
character might influence the Grand Signior to guarantee our treaties
with the Barbary powers, and t.hey would then never dare to infringe
tbem.
The Brig [St.Crwifiso] captured off Tripoly by the N a ~ i l wthe
,
Govr of this Island acknowledges to be a fair prize, and will lay no
claim on her. I t will not be prudent to send her home at this season
of the year, as she is a very dull sailer, and I cannot at present spare
men, as soon as I conveniently can, I shall send her to the United
States.
I have just r e d letters from Captain Bainbridge he acknowledges
the receipt of six letters from me, and a quantity of clothing, stores,
and one thousand dolls for the OfGcers, and Crew. They are closely
confined since the burning of the Frigate, but I have allowed the
Tripoline Prisoners I have, to write to Tripoly, and when the Bashaw
is informed of the manner in which I treat them, he will undoubtedly
more favorably towards Capt-ainbridge,
his Officers and
conduct
Crew.
The Barbary Powers are daily increasing their Naval force, and will
soon become powerful, if not seasonably checked Let me once more
enforce the necessity of an addition to our S uadron of two or three
frigates. If you send three be assured we s h h eventually be gainers
by it, as it will give us a consequence with the Barbar States which
we want. If no additional force arrives before the d d d l e of Mag,
I shall take Derne and Bengaza, to deprive the Tripoline Corsairs of
a rendezvous there, and the Bashaw of t.he revenues of that Beylic;
but I shall be obliged to destroy the Towns, unless the Bashaw's
brother contrives to march from Alexandria in Season to receive the
possession of them from us, I shall then commence my operations

Con~titution

12th March 180.4.
DEARSIR, I have received your several favours of February &
March and cannot conceive why the Bashaw should have changed
his Conduct by removing you to the Castle, and depriving you of
the priviledges you enjoyed previous to our burning the Frigate.
She was burned by m orders, and without the previous knowledge
of any person in T r i p y. I had a right to burn her, but if I had not,
the Bashaw would be unjust to punish you for an Act of Mine of
which you could have no knowledge or foresight.
The Minister says I am wanting in the practice of humanity before
he again makes the assertion, let him en uire of his Country Men
Prisoners with me. I have given them fu liberty to write without
restraint or examination of their letters; and when I appear off
Tripoly if he chooses he may send one of his Officers on board to
accompany one of the Consuls and learn from the mouths of the
Prisoners how they have constantly been treated. After such an
enquiry he will not have reason to accuse me of a want of humanity.I regret that any lives were lost in destroying the Frigate, the Men
who were killed in taking possession of her, had a right to expect
their fate from the opposition they made, and the alarm they endeavoured to create Our People were few in number, and had everything
to ap rehend from an attack by their Cruisers and armed boats
The fficer who conducted the expedition has not reported to me
any act of Massacre or inhumanity - People who handle dangerous
weapons in War, must expect wounds and Death, but I shall never
countenance or encourage wanton acts of Cruelty I have not yet been bong with answer which the Minister Mentioned to have been made to my letter of the 4th January.
Mr Schambri whom the Minister styles (in his letter to you) my
Ambassador, has no more authority from me than I have knowledge
of him, and I assure you I never spoke to, or saw him since I was
created.
When the Bashaw chooses to propose a Negotiation I will attend
to it, if consistent with the honor and dignity of the United States.
I very soon expect M? OBrien here from Algiers on business. MI
the clothug for your sailors are made, and on board this ship.

DEARSIR,The prize I captured off Tripoly the 23rd of December
was the Martingma or Ketch which assisted in making prize of
the Philadelphia -She was under Turkish Colours when you had the
misfortune to run on the rocks, but as soon as that event took place,
he hauled them down and hoisted Tripoline Colours, took on board
as many Tripohes armed, as her Decks would hold, slipped her
Cables, and went out to the attack, Anchored as near as they dared
to, and as soon as you struck your Colours, her boats were manned,
and they boarded you. Mustapha Rais who commanded her, was
the most active in making Prisoners of yourself and Officers, and
conducting you to the Bashaw. He was also extremely active in
plundering the property of the Officers. The Turkish Officer who
was passenger on board, and also with you in the [George] Washington
is gone to Coastantinople. I released him as he had no concern in
the business: I have his,'deposition and that of seven others who
were captured in her, which makes prize of the Vessel and Cargo,
and Pirates of the Captain and four other Cretans who were concerned
in the infamous transaction. I have written a full account of the
whole business to the Ottoman Forte, and to the English and French
Ambassadors st that Court. I presume that the Grand Sei-pior
will demand of the Bashaw of Tripoly the release of you all, as you
were captured Piratically by the assistance of a Vessel which was a
few moments before bearing the Ottoman Colours and that he will
also demand of the Bashaw satisfaction for permitting this Piratical
transaction with impunity.

Malta Harbour March l p @
SIR, A heavy Gale of wind from the E N E has detained me here
since my last; the moment i t subsides, and changes I shall put to sea.
Yesterday a Boat from the Tunissian Admiral came alongside with
three Officers, and in a haughty imperious tone, demanded that
I should turn all our Prisoners up for his inspection to enable him
to judge if there were any Tunissians among them I replied to him
that I had released the only one of his nation that had fallen into
my hands among the Tripolines; this was not satisfactory, and as
I did not think the request or the manner in which it was made very
decent or proper on their part, I refused to gratify them or degrade
ourselves by a compliance, they then moved off but observed that
it would not be lon before they should have plenty of us. I t is
possible they may te truth, but I suspect they will pay dear for their
bargain I have been told from good authority here, that it is the
intention of the Bey of Tunis to declare T a r against us as soon as
the Spring opens, if we do not give him a Frigate completely equipped.
This I am confident our Government never will do. of course we
must look out for War. The Tunisaians have more Kaval force than
I can watch with sufficient attention to prevent them from injuring
our Commerce, and at the same time carry on the Siege of Tripoly.
I beg you to pardon my solicitation that additional force may be
sent out with all possible expedition I feel extremely desirous of serving my Country - Give me the means and I will do it, by rendering
the purchase of Peace or payment of Tribute totally unnecessary in
this Eastern World. I n the mean time every thing shall be done
that our little Squadron is competent to, and I hope more than can
be reasonably expected from it.
I have to observe that the Provisions sent out in the V7iUiam &

remained here three days. On the fourth I rec* a letter from Mr

I circulated a re ort that we were short handed, and what few we had
were sickly the 6th I re& a letter from Mr Davis mentioning
that he was summoned to the castle, together with the Bashaw of
Tripoly's Consul, he mentioned also that he had strong suspicions
that the Tripolitans had requested my detention in port. I of course
got under weigh immediately, and cruised off Cape Bon until the 1 3 ~ "
when supposing it possible he might have slipped out unobserved, I run
into the roads to ascertain where I found him hauled into the Mole
with all his yards upon deck I was informed he hauled in, and stript
the day after my departure, since which period, the whole of his Crew
had deserted him. There can be no doubt but he is bound direct for
Tripoly, as he had taken on board a very Valuable Cargo. of dry
Goods belonging to the Bashaw. I left him discharging his Cargo
again. I touched here for the purpose of giving you this information
and replenishing our Wood, which is entirely out. I reported a t Tunis
my intention was to remain off the Bay until relieved by another
Vessel - We have had easterly winds for ten days past, and blowing

the total destruction of the ship Philadelphia, in the Port of Tnpoli. this intelligence was yesterday received here by the Danish Consul,
from the Consul of the same nation a t Tripoli in date of the 29'@of

smallest having the Appearance of a Merchant Vessel, entered boldly
the Port at half past Nine in the evening, and having taken designedly
some turks on board, they requested in the language ?f the country,
of those in the frigate to suffer them to anchor a long side; which was
immediately granted, and even assisted in bringing her to moorings.
this was no sooner effected, than an hundred well armed Arne.ricans
leaped on board, cutting down every one who opposed them, whde the
more prudent, took their flight by leaping into the sea and gaining the
Shore. - almost instantaneously the Ship was in a blaze, and the
Small Vessels again out of the port, before any orders could be given
by the Bey, dthough he saw the burning of his frigate from the
windows of his palace Nothing I am told can be compared to his
unavadhg anger; but in order to spend his rage on some object, he
has order'd an additional portion of labor to the fore-mast men of the
PhiZadelphia, and the Officers so closely guarded, that even communication by writing is interdicted them. - were i t not for his hopes of
a heavy ransom, they would most assuredly experience some more
distressing marks of his disappointment. - The Danish Consul adds
in his letter, that the Bey's Charge d'affaires at Malta had very
lately returned to Tripoli, and "it is said" with proposals of accomodation from ComQPreble". - if this were eyen true, the grounds
on which they would have negociated a t that time, are since changed
by the burning ofthe frigate, and will increase the demands of the
Bey in the same proportion as he estimates her loss. - indeed, I am
told that he bitterly swears that for less than a million of dollars, he
will not hearken to any overtures of peace. - on the 6 t b ins; a Yea olit& squadron of five frigates sailed on a cruize against all the arbaresque powers. -

of the Bashaw of Tripoli making peace with us upon proper terms.
Should he not do this, every arrangement is made to give him warm
work in the ensuing summer. Our -4ffairs here appear to s t m d well at present. We have no
special diEculty before us; but nothing is certain in these latitudes.
The Bey of Tunis is not very well satisfied with the U. States; but he
has no just grounds of difference; and while we have a force in this

he has an equal in our commander: He has many of my friends in

SIR, I arrived here last evening from a Cruise and was hone with
your Dispatches of the 17'h January, and under the same cover a letter
for the French Commissary in Tripol which I shall attend to and
deliver the first opportunity. This S ip is now receiving on board
Provisions and Water, and will sail again tomorrow for the Enemy's
Cosst. The generous and friendly interference of the first Consul
[Napoleon Bonaparte] for the purpose of endeavouring to liberate
our unfortunate Citizens in Tripoly and restore Peace between the
United States and that Regency is truly characteristic of that great
Man, and an additional proof of the close alliance of humanity, with
intrepidity
By the enclosed Duplicate of a letter to yr: Excell? under date the
19th Ulto: you wiU be informed of the particulars of the taking and
burning of the Tripoline Frigate late the Philadelphia. I determined
from the moment I h a d she was in possession of the Enemy to destroy her, and it has been done. This will seriously effect the Bashaw
who is poor as it has deprived him of the resources which the sale of
her to Algiers or Tunis would have afforded, and at the same time;
those Powers are deprived of an important addition of strength to
their Navy. The Bashaw is extremely angry since the loss of the ship,
and has removed our Citizens within the Walls of his Castle, and does
not d o w either of the Consuls or Commissaries to see or speak to
them,but I have s uufficient number of Tripoline Prisoners of distinction m my posseasion to insure their safety. I treat my Prisoners
with the utmost kindness and attention, and have allowed them to
write and make what communication they please to the Bashaw
without examining their letters, conscious that the cannot say
anything but what must lend to our advantage.
he Bashaw's
first expectation for the ransom of our people and a Peace, is said to
have been three Millions of Dollp! he has however fallen considerably,
as not long eince he offered thro' his Agent at Malta to make a truce
for five years without Money. I observed to him that my Government never would c o m n t to a truce, it must be a solid Pesce on the

same terms for that we never would purchase Peace, or pay him
Tribute and I have no doubt but we shall be able to dictate our own
terms before the last of July. I am preparing to attack his Coasts on
every part of it, and have applied to the Neapolitan Govr for the loan
or hzre of a few Gun & Mortar Boats, which if I obtain, I will oblige
the Bashaw to sue for Peace as a favour in three days after I reach his
Coast I wish you could prevail on the French Govern, to influence the
Neapolitan to loan or hire us what Gun & Mortar Boats we stand in
need of, we paying for such as might be lost, and making ood all
damages, and to furnish us with Amunition The King of r$aples is
at War with all the Barbary States, of course it will be for his Interest
to comply, as it will enable us to destroy all the Bashaw's Towns on
the Sea Coast, and all his Cruisers, of course it will be a long time
before the Tripolines can again depredate on the Coast of Sicily.
Perhaps the desire of the First Consul that Peace may be established
will have the effect, but it will be well to take the precaution to have
the Gun Boats kc+ a t command in case it should not. I have sent a
vessel to Algiers for Col: Lear, and expect him very soon, when I
shall deliver him the papers you desire me to. He has full powers to
make peace, but not to pay Money for it: he is only authorized to
give a consular present of Ten thousand doll* and that is more than
we ever ought to consent to give them. I had rather spend my life in
these seas than ever purchase Peace, or pay tribute to the Barbary
States, and I believe i t is the intention of our Governt never to consent
to either I have taken two Prizes and seventy Tripoline Prisoners;
and have written to the Bashaw proposing an exchange of Prisoners
An answer has [not] yet come to hand. I am at present in great haste
but shall in future take every opportunity to write you, and keep you
informed of my proceedings. I have had frequent opportunities of
writing to America since I have been on this station.

Excellency Side Hamet Caromanli, Brother to the Present Bashaw

As Side Hamet Caromanli, has Promised to repay all the Money
&$advanced to him or on his Account and to remain at Peace forever
with America, and to put them in Possesion of one of the Principal
Forts in Tripoli untill the Expences is repaid but this is of less conseuence to America than the Effect it will have with the other Barbary
Ztates. and if Tripoli is taken in this manner, I am convinced
America will be a t Peace with those States for many years, for Should
the Present Bashaw make Peace with his Brother or America seperately, he will then be more revenged with the other, for I can Prove
to your Excellency that I prevented him from making Peace with his
Brother who had not knowledge to see, that he would only make
P e w with him untill he did so with America, & afterwards he would go
to war with them seperatly, but I am happy to think I was the Cause
of him commencing Hostilitys with his Brother untill America had
made Peace, and also to prevent him from Poisoning his Brother
which he had in contem lation by offering his Docter (who is now
in Syracusa and in the Lrvice of America by my recomendation) a
reward of ten Thousand Dollars to go to Derna to Poison his Brother!
he has Murderd another Brother [Hassan] some years ago and in the
Presance of their Mother - therefore it is better for America to be
a t the &st expence to make a Insting Peace with all the Barbary
States for they only go to war with those who are afraid of them, and
should a patched up Peace be made with him, he says & will make
war against Denmark or Sweeden and in rotation with the United
States again, therefore this is the time to make a long Peace with
them all. I have inclosed one of the Official Letters to me when I
was in Tripoli for the attention I paid to the American Officer there,
by a Letter I r e d the other day from the English Consul that the
Bashaw will write to Sir A. Ball about my assisting the Americans

SIR, I have this moment received intelligence from a gentleman
just arrived from Tunis that the Bey of that Regency is equipping

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1803 TO 18011

his whole Naval force with the utmost expedition, and it is whispered
that the object is the American Commerce: from various ciroumstances I believe there is much truth in the conjecturc. Three of
their Frigates from 24 to 32 Guns are now fitting out at Malta, One
Frigate of 32 Guns, and a number of smaller Vessels are getting
ready at Tunis. I have written home by two favourable op ortunities requesting an addition to my Squadron, as we have onf one
Brig of 16 Guns and three Schooners of 14 each besides this s& in
these Seas, and one Brig at Gibraltar. This force is unequaf to
Blockade Triply, and protect our trade against the Tunisians. I
have long since stated to our Government the necessity of sending
out two or three more Frigates. If they arrive soon, it will most
undoubtedly check the Tunissians and keep them in peace; if not,
our Commerce may suffer in some degree, as it is impossible for me
to guard all parts of the Mediterranean with so small a Squadron.
I shall, however, do all in my power to make them repent their want
of good faith; and shall visit Tunis ba immediately with as many
of the Squadron as can be collected off L p o l , to endeavour to learn
what the intentions of the Bey are, and shal write you the moment
I can come at the truth. The Bey is very much dissatisfied that the
United States will not give him a Frigate which he has demanded of
them; and this is to be his pretext for War. These people must not
be humoured but beaten. I was at Malta not long since, and was
then told by good authority that we might expect War with Tunis

SIR Agreeably to your order I submitt to you an account of the

U S Brig Syren.
At 4 A A4 the Syren was three quaters of a Mile a head on our
weather bow we then having our starboard tacks on board with the
Wind at E S E. At about 20 Minutes after 4. I discovered the Syren
bearing away I supposed with the intention of wearing yet did not
alter my course untill I could determine what she intended doing,
by this time she was on our lee bow three cables length distant with
her yards square. I then ordered the quater master to keep his luff
which he did bringing her nearly on our lee beam intendi to shoot
across her stern and mew after her that we might pass to eeward of
her. Observing his bracing up on the larboard tack and finding we
could not weather and bad not room to wear, I ordered the helm to
be put alee & at the same time hailed the brig and told her to put
her helm a weather, but received no answer I then hailed her again
and received no answer when she run her Jibb boom just fore head of
our main Mast and we sustained the damage which has occassioned

That for many years prior to the Blockade established by your
Excdencys orders, before the Port of Tripoli your Memorialist
carried on a considerable commerce with that City, & was so far in
the confidence & esteem of the Baahaw as to be appointed his Consul
at Malta, yet notwithstanding his principal support was derived from
this Branch of his trade he determined from the time he became

aded Port unless so far as he might be authorised thereto by your
Excallencp express permission. That having in the early part of Febru
last observed your Excellency in conversation and intercourse wit Mr Wilkie his Majestys
Commissary for the Reet at Malta, & with whom your Memorialist
was intimately acquainted, it occurred to your Memorialist that an
offer to sound the inclination of the Bashaw towards an accommodation
with the United States might not be unacceptable to your Excellency,
that our Memorialist communicated his Ideas u on the subject to
Mr dilkie & having been assured b him of your xcellencys approbation embarked on board a Vesse of his own named the Transfer
bearing his Britannic Majestys Letter of Mar ue, & which was
going under your excellencys Licence to be loade with Bullocks for
Malta. That your Memorialist left Malta on the 13'@of FebT but being
forced back by contrary winds was obliged to remain in the harbour
of the Valette till the 17'Q when he again sailed for Tripoli & arrived
there on the 21'1 That from the moment of his arrival there he gave up most part
of his time and attention to discovering the sentiments of the Bashaw,
and endeavouring by a faithfull representation of the power & preparations of the United States to induce him to wave those pretentions
to tribute upon which he had formerly insisted & at last succeeded
so far as to prevail upon him to treat with your Excellency upon the
sole conditions of Ransoming such Americans as were at that time
prisoners in his possession, at which time the Bashaw also furnished
your Memorialist with a set of Signals to facilitate any communication
which your Excellency might be inclined to open with him. That your Memorialist in the mean time caused one Vessel to be
laden with such Cattle as he was able to procure & conceiving this a
a large sum then due
Butts of Oil, & Iron on
to him in discharge of
board the
the account, the Bashaw not being able a eeably to the wish & request
of our Memorialist to furnish him with ullocks
Ghat in so withdrawing his property our Memorialist was so little
apprehensive of incurring your Exce encys displeasure that the
Transfer sailed from Tripoli m open day when some of your Cruizers
were actually in sight, & with orders to lie off till such time as our
Memorialist having finished some private affairs should be ab e to
follow her. It was therefore with extreme surprize & sorrow that your Memorialist saw from the shore the seizure of his Ship, & that he has since
been informed of the Capture of two other Vessels of which one laden
sold with Cattle was seized for not having compleated her Voyage
by e l e t of March, & the other was taken on her Voyage outward,
for having on board certain Tripoline passengers, and also some few
Articles of Commerce chiefly Boards & pavlng Stones which were
nevertheleas to have been landed at Gerba, a port in the dominions
of Tunis,prior to the Vessel proceedmg to Tripoli for Cattle. Under these Circumstances your Memorialist humbly hopes from
our Excellent 's Justice & humanity the restitution of the
$ . m , & suc part of the Cargoes of all the three V
d as belong
particularly to him.

your Memorialist submits that no Licence was necessary, & no offence
could of course be committed, that the dday of the Vessel laden with
Csttle was in part owing to muses which he could not controd, &
partly to his Zed in execut' your Excellency's commission, & with
respect to the Oil shipped in%e T~amjer,he trusts that a reasonable
distinction will be made between a common Mercantile transaction,

been conducted in direct. violation of the Blockade and my particular
Passport I have adverted ve
briefly as to the circumstances
under whirh they were taken, Rr have now only to make a few general
remarks on the motives by which you hltve been governed.
You have prefaced your appeal with circumstances which only
exist in Idea. You m p a t e to yourself the posession of the "confidence and esteem of the Bashaw of Tripoly": and the "pnrticular
ac uaintance of Ni? Wilkie His Majesty's Commissary for the Fleet
a t k d t a " - This you seem to suppose a sufficient reason why you
should (unasked) interfere in the Afffih of the U. S. of America Insolent Medlar! - Have you sagacity enough to c~lculrttethe
pernicious consequence of your Duplicity? Do you know, that your
dl timed officiousness served only to raise the sordid expectations of
a Barbarian?-No - You do not exactly comprehend the extent of
t mothe mischief you hffve done - but this you well know, t b ~ the
tives of this fraud against the U. S, were to secure the mouey you bad
then due in that regcncv and to make as much more as you could b
the Violation of ihe iaith reposed in you by his Excellency Go+
I only regret that an investigation must be deferred until Inid
before my Go+: tbis I shall make a point of doing the moment I
amve in the U. S. 8 I h ~ v eno doubt but they will demnnd of the
English Govi an enquiry into your conduct, and have still Iess doubt
but they d l award a punishment tantamount to your iniquitious
proceedings In conclusion 1 have to observe that all your vessels shall be subject
to trial by the Admiralty Courts of my Country - I n addition to
which I would adrise you to be caut~iousin agslin interfering in the
affrtirrr of those who WIN not fail to detect your duplicity & want of
common Honour & honmty.
I am not uninformed of your 1nt.e attempt to supply our Enemy

DEARSIB,I had the honor to receive by Lieu' Commf Smith of
the United States Schooner Vixen, your several favours of the 17'9
and 31'1 January and 3'g & 19'9 of February, with their enclosures.
The burning of the Philadelphia, is a circumstance which does honor
to the head which planned, and the bold enterprize which executed
it. I think it must be productive of good effects to our affairs in
fhis Sea.
The Vizen arrived in this Bay on the 15'9 instant. Upon the
fullest consideration I can give the subject, I am persuaded it would
not be for the interest of our Country that I should leave this Regency
a t present, even if I could obtain the Dey's permission, which might
be somewhat doubtful, as we are indebted to him on account of our

is the aid you will most want, and which can be much better supplied
by Mr OBrien, than by me. As he had been making arrangernt* to
leave this place with hts family for Alicante in a short time, he tagea
them up with him, in order to proceed from that quarter to the U.S.
whenever an opportunity may offer; or when his semices can be
dis ensed with.
order to give MI OBrien time to prepare for his departure (which
would require some days) Lieu' Cornmt Smith with my ap robation,
left this on the 16th instant, to look over on the coast of pain, and
has returned here this day. He must be detained until the 25**
instant, ss the Mahometan feast of Biram commenced yesterday,
and will not finish 'till tomorrow night during which time it is not
practicable to get t h ~ people
e
to do that kind of work which is
necessary for embarkmg a family This will I hope, excuse Lieu1
Commandant Smith from any blame on account of unnece
delay; and I believe the services which Mc OBrien can r e n d e r 3
fully compensate for the loss of a few days.
In your letter of the 31st of January, you mention that the Agent
of the Bashaw of Tri oly at Malta, had proposed that we should give
the Bssbaw 500 ~ o B a r sfor each of the P h W l p h i a ' s OfEcera and
Crew. - A schooner in exchange for the Frigate, and make peace
without Money or Tribute; and that they would exchange 60 Americans for the sixty Tripolines in your possession. If these terms could
be insured, I think there should be no hesitation in accepting them;
for they are much better than our Government had calculated upon
utting the loss of the P h W p h i a out of the question) In order
t at ou may see the views of the Government when we left the U S
I encgse a copy of a letter on that subject from the Secretary of State
to Mr Cathcart dated April 9th 1803 and which I was authorised to
go to, if Peace should not be previously made.
You wish to know what sum I will authorize you to pay for the ransom of the Officers and Crew of the YhilcKielphia, if the Bashaw will
make peace without Money - mthout any Annual Tribute, or
Consular present, excepting a small present on the reception of the
first Consul that is appointed. As I have no special authority on this
subject, I can only say, that I should not hesitate to take upon myself
in behalf of the United States to pay at the rate of six hundred doBam
for each (exclusive of what might be exchanged) upon the ratification
of the other parts relating to peace &c* And should you consider
my sanction necessary I do hereby authorize you to act in this business
ta any extent that I might go myself.
f have the honor to enclose copies of my letters to George Davis
Esqr our Charge d'affairs at Tunis, by which you will see the steps I
have taken to supply the wants of our unfortunate fellow Citizens in
Tripoli; also copies of my letters to C. Bainb~dge From Dr Davis
I have not had a line since the 27 December I s h d write to him by
this opportunity, and Mr OBrien
be able (if the V b n touches
there) to give you full information on our affairs in Tunis. As it is
probable that new instructions respecting that power will be soon
received from our Government in consequence of the refusal of Mr
Cathcart, and the Bey's subsequent letter to the President, I have
hitherto avoided taking any steps in the business.
To Mr OBrien I must refer you for a fulI detail of our afFaire here,he

say that we appear to stand well here at present. I yesterday made
out the Consular pass rta and other documents for the C m r s of
this Regency; a list o which, is enclosed, and also ten copies of the
Consular passport and Prize certificate, which will afford one for each
of your Squadron to assist them in their examination if they should
meet with any of these cruisers at Sea. I t is thought however, that
they will not send out more than two or three, if any before these
a$airs are settled with the British
The News papers which you was so good as to send me by the Vixen
gave the latest intelligence we have had from the U S. I am in daily
expectation of hearing what measures the Government has taken in
consequence of the loss of the Philadelphia. I wrote to the Secretary
of State on this event, that, in my opinion, it would have such an
effect on our &airs in these Regencies that the Governrnt must
determine either to follow her loss by a force suEicient to reduce
Tripoli to terms at once, or become tributary to all the Regencies to
any extent they might think roper to demand - or withdraw our
commerce entirely from this L a , which would be attended with as
great an expence in keeping Ships of War to guard the Straits as to
effect the first point.
M" Lear sends you by CapWBrien a sword Belt, which she has
had embroidered here for you, and of which she begs your accepq with
her best wishes for your health, happiness, and prosperity There are
no clasps or Buckles to it, as they could not be so well done here, as
the ma be elsewhere.
tezyou my dear Sir, what I think of your conduct since you have
been in this Sea, would appear too much like flattery. I hope and
trust you will find our Country ready to pay the tribute due to your
talents, your patriotism, and your activity. Ardent as I know you
would be to gather laurels in your profession, yet, I am equally certain
that the love of your Country would never permit you to sacrifice her
peace and interest, when they can be
with honor & propriety
To the Officers of your Ship and

SIR, I cannot forbear expressing the surprize I felt in not having
received a line from You since Your letter of the 27'9 of December,
and especially when our Affairs at Tunis & Tripoli are in a situation
to make me feel anxious to hear from those qumters as often as
- The other Consuls here have received letters Iatel
and t h o u h them I learn that the Spanish Brig, whio
sailed from hence for unis on the 20'9 of Jan?, on board of which
was put two thousand dollars for You, to be ap lied to relieve the
wants of our unfortunate Countrymen in 'I'ript, had arrived. I
cannot ersuade myself but You must have written, and that Your

I enclose copies of my three last, Viz. Nvs 5. 6. & 7. The U. S Schooner Vizen, Lieu! Corndt Smith, arrived here on the

Coast of Spain, & sails again tomorrow to join the Commodore.
In her goes Cap$ OBrien, my predecessor, with his family. Should
the Schooner touch at Tunis this will be handed you by Captain
OBrien, to whoom You will be so good as to make a full communication of our &airs with that Regency; and I trust that his general
knowledge of the whole of our business with these Regencies, and of
them, d enable you and him to ascertain the ultimate view8 and
ctations of the Bey of Tunis with respect to &haU. States.
e$have r e d from Commodore Preble a copy of your letter to him
of the 26'9 of Jan? with its enclosures. If the sum of four thousand
dollars demanded on account of property vended at Malta, would be
the means of preserving peace with that Regency, and doing swcay
the discontents which appear to prevail, I should have no hesitation
in paying it immediately; but if it will not have that effect, nor answer
any good
ose to our Country, it would not be worth while to
pay it; &?our
responsibility therefor makes it necessary. - On
thls subject of the four thousand dollars You and Cap$ OBrien will

A passport was yesterday demanded by the Commercid A ent
for a Vessel (as he says) bound for Constantinople, but to touc a t
some port in Tripoli. - I t has been refused. I have no doubt but it
was for the Enemy's Corsair, and that she will shortly snake the
attempt, probably shaping her course for Jerba.

y sent
an express, advising the Schooner's getting underway before morning - as the intelligence I should have to give to His Excellen
Bey, would be as painfull to him, as it waa une ected, (the hilathe
delphia being destined for this place) - I plead indisposition, and
sent the necessaq communications b my Drogerman. - The
burning of the Pht.ih?elphia, under the gashaw's forts, has not only
made a Serious impression on our d o e enemy; but will have the
greatest idiuence, with thb Prince;each wandering Bedouin, details
the daring action, and augurs somethmg dreadful to our enem from
this event: in short, i t is the only occurrence, which has f o r A them
to view the American Ghuracter with proper respect. - The sudden
disappearance of the Schooner, excited the curiosity of many; and
for the moment, permitted the Tripolitans, to make deductions most
favourable to themselves. - On the 13'9 the Enterprize, again entered
the harbour - the sight of her gave a general p&c to the crew of the
Tripolitan, who took baggage and abandoned their Corsair the same
evening. (The Schooner, after laying too some time, shaped her
wurse for Sicily.) The Rais, and eat part of the crew, have already
left this (by land) for Tripoli; and tgfeir intention is to send the Polacre
to the nearest port in Tripoli, under some neutral flag, as a Merchant
Vessel - of this circumstance the Commodore, has already been
apprized, and I trust, has taken such measures, as ts ensure her
capture, should she make the attempt.
On the 23g instant, a Spanish Felucca, arrived from Tangiers, (last
from Algiers) bound for Tripoli - I have every reason to sus

Dr SIR,On the 9th inst. I wrote you a lenphy letter in cipher, but

always on their guard when laying in the port of Syracuse, and that it
was necessary to examine strictly all descri tion of Vessels and trust

and not the least service; i t is reported that he offered any sum
inj
wh% they would demand; and if he was charged by you with a commission to negotiate he did not steer in the roper channel, for he
should have treated with Sidi Muhammed Dg 'es, Minister, and not
directly with the Bashaw - the Minister is the proper person to
address in such affairs - he has much the coddence of the Bashaw,
and his powerful interest may naturally be expected to be a t varience
with any negotiation that 1s not carried on in its pro r channel
through him. When any person comes to treat the s ould study
well the disposition of the Minister, and like an able p%isician feel his
pulse before they prescribe; but this should be done in a most secret
and liberal manner: you may be assured that such conduct will tend
much to the interest of the United States in negotiating -I fre uently
mentioned to you Consul OBrien as a very pro r person to e sent
here; let who will come he should be a man o address to act with
discretion, for only such an one will take to advantage with the minister, who is a man of the world has great discernment and much politeness. I sincerely hope soon to hear of your being off here on the business of treating; by your having a proper character to remain on
shore to communicate with you as circumstances may require, I
flatter myself a peace would readily take place on as advantageous
terms as could be got, - except our country would act with spirit and
distroy the place, which could be effected by sending 3 or 4 thousand
troops, and if i t was possible to observe profound secrecy of the
expedition, I have no doubt but a much less force would accomplish
it: I am clearly of Opinion that if you could arm about 18 or 20 ships
boats you can destroy all the Gun Boats, which would be attended
with the most favorable consequences towards a peace; the Gun Boats
about 25 or 30 men, - they are a dastardly set of wretches.
E%%d you effect the exchange of a Lieu1 or two by giving all the
Tripolitans in your possession, i t would be attended with great
advantages, as they could give you that information which i t is imossible for me to do by letter, and could act as pilots, and would be
round Very servicable oflieem in any attempt made on this Place, being
acquainted with its situation and are men of information and courage; - I sincerely hope that you will be able to effect the release of one
If not two of them. A few bomb shells thrown into this Town would
do damage and cause great alarm. Their Batteries are all in bad
order, and they are very bad Gunners.
We are still confined in the Palace, surrounded with guards, and I
write this letter without seeing the possibility of getting it out of our
prison, however, Magical aid may assist me.
Believe me to be with sincere wishes for success to attend your
plans, and Honor & Glory be the reward you meet with from your
country
Wq BAINBRIDQE
P. S. The Minister has informed me that Mr Cathcart would not
be received as Consul, but they will receive him as Negotiator. This
information is suflticient to convince me that it would be highly
impolitic for him to have any hand in the Negotiation, not alluding
to m y fault of Mq C's, but his standing with this Government.

xmmswiea as we might want. Our dwelling wse furnished in a plain st le, and
we were supplied with freah provisions that were tolerably good. d e were
dowed to go to the front door, and to walk on the terrace or top of the house,

which commanded a handsome prospect of the harbour, the sea, the town, the
place, and the adjoining country. Here we could see our ship on the rocks,
full of Turks, and surrounded by their boats, and a constant stream of boats
going to, and bringing off, the plunder of the ship. We could see these robbers
running about town, with our uniform mats and other clothing on. The minister
of exteriour relations promised to be friendly, and collect as much of our clothing
and effecta as he could, and return them to us.
Nw. 3.-The Bashaw sent for the carpenter to go on board the ship; he went
and found six feet water in the hold. The carpenter's crew and fifty men were
ordered and carried on board to work a t night. A gale of wind and heavy sea
hove the ship off the rocks, and the carpenter returned.
Nos. 4.-In the morning lieutenants Hunt and Osborne, and myself, were a t
the Danish consul's observatory, on the top of his house, upon a plain with and
adjoining ours, which together made a large and handsome walk. We were
looking a t the ehip with Mr. Nissen's glass, when our drogerman came and informed us that the Bsshaw had ordered us not to walk upon the terrace any
more. We immediately returned to our house.
Nm.5.-Our new masters came and closed up the passage which led to the top
of the house; and a guard was set a t the front door to prevent our going into the
street. The minister sent his chief secretary with a parole of honour, written in
French, which we all signed.
Nos. 6.-We found that we were not allowed to go out, notwithstanding our
eigning the parole of honour. The minister of exteriour relations sent us word
that he had got eight of our trunks, which we might have for twelve hundred
dollars. We did not take them, nor thank him for his hospitality. We purchrrsed
new blanketa, sent to us by the Danish consul. The English consul, Mr.
M'Donald, paid us a visit and offered us every assistance in his power.
Nw. 8.-The Jewa purchased some of our clothing and offered it to us a t an
enormous price; but we purchased but little of it. The Bashaw sent for captain
Bainbridge and told him that John Wilson had informed that captain Bainbridge,
before hauling down the colours, threw over nineteen boxes of dollars and a large
bag of gold. Captain Bainbridge assured him it was false, and gave his word
and honour, that there was no monev thrown over to his knowledge; but that
the money in question was left a t Malta. In the evening, the Bashaw not being
eatided, sent for the captain's servant, and ordered him to be flogged if he did
not tell the truth concerning the money. The boy denied having any knowledge
of it. After repeating the threat several times, and the boy insisting that he
knew nothing about the money, he was acquitted. Wilson had turned traitor,
and given the enemy all the &stance in his power. He now acts as overseer
over our men.
Nm. 9.-Our captain established s credit with the Danish consul, who supplied
na with necessary proviaion, and with cloth for matrasaes. A guard was poated
at our door, to prevent our going into the street, or purchasing any books or
clothing.
Nw. 10.-Several Turks came and informed captain Bainbridge that the
Bashaw had been told that captain Rogers who commanded the U. S. frigate
John Adam, treated the Tripolitan prisoners taken last summer, very bad; and
that they feared we should suffer for it.
We have plenty of pomegranates, d a b and oranges. The Danish consul
vlsita w ev
Nou. t?i.-%$%inhtm
of exteriour relations sent his drogerman to captain
binbridge and informed him, that if he would send an immediate order to commodore Preble, to deliver up the Tripolitan prisonem captured by captain Rogers
last summer, amounting to about eighty in number, we might remain where we
wwe, but if he did not comply, we should fare worse. Captain Bainbridge replied
that he could not commmd commodore Preble, and therefore could not aomply
with his request. At 9, in the evening, a Tripolitan officer csme armed with two
istob and a sabre, and said, To night nothing; kcmorrow the MI&. We accordprepared for the castle.
au. 14.-Breakfaeted early, to be ready for our new habitation. At 9, A.M.
s guard came and ordered us to the castle. We formed agreeable to rank, and
rmvcbad to the castle. We were huddled into the moat gloomy cell, among our
mem, where therewae hardly room for us to stend. Here we spent the day without
food, and were scoffed at by our foes until night when, to our happy mtrprlse, we

sent for captain Bainbridge, and affected great aurpriee a t our going to the d e ,
ss ing that he knew nothing of the measure, which we all knew to be false. He
to& captain Bainbridge that we should remain where we were until he heard from

hie people, the p h n e r s , in the hands of the Americans.
Nm. 17.-Visited our sick, who were quartered in a small houae without a
floor, near the palace, and about half a mile from our lodgings. The Danish
consul supplied the sick with fresh provisions, by the request of csptain Bainbridge,
Now. 24.-The Bashaw refused to furnish necessary clothing for the sick, or
any thin for them to eat, bat sour filthy bread.-Captain Beinbridge contracted
with the(broiah consul to supply the sick with beef and uegetablea for soup every
rlnv
-J

-

Nov. 27.-Our men complained of their hard usage, in being com lled to &I
on the cold damp ground, to eat bad bread, to work hard, and to be Tmtinadoed
by their drivers.
Nov. 30.-One of our men in a fit of despair attempted to kill himself; but was
prevented by the Turks, when in the act of cutting his throat. The wound did
not prove mortal. I was permitted by the minister to call on the Spanish physician for medicine for Dr. Ridgley, who was then sick.
December 6.-The Bashaw sent for me to prescribe for himself and two offieem
of his body guard, and ordered me to get such medicine as wss necessary of the
minister, who had a medicine chest.
Dec. 6.-Visited the sick a t the palace, and found them all better. I was received
and treated very politely. The minister sent for me to cure him of a blindness in
the left eye. I prescribed for him with very little success.
Dw. 7.-Visited the ambsssador of Constantinople, who was affected with the
intermitting fever. Found my patients a t the palace almost well.
Dec. 12.-Wae called on by the general of Marine to visit his principal secretary.
Before I was permitted to give any medicine the Turks, aix in number, with
Hamel, our drogerman, summoned the sick man, and offered a prayer to Mahomet.
The sick man then told me that if I would cure him he would be very thankful,
and would s eak to the Bashaw in our favour.
Dec. 15.-%he B ~ s h a whad a schooner bunched, which was built by the Spanish
carpentam. She was tolerably handsome, and calculated to carry six guns. When
she was launched, three guns were fired from the batteries, and the eonsuls
hoisted all their colours. At sun set, a firing from the batteriea announced &he
commencement of the Mahometan Ramadam, continuing a lunar month, in
which they neither eat, drink, nor smoke, while the sun is above the horizon, but
feast a t night. I n walking through the town, to visit my patients, I found the
mosque and principal houses illuminated, and the people rejoicing. P m i n g the

DEAR SIR I wrote you that the clothing for your Crew was all

for each, by a Boat which he shall hire for the purpose, and at the
same time send you any Stores you or your Officers may want.
I have directed my Surgeon to put up a quantity of Medicine which
I suppose must be wanted by the Officers & Crew and I also send you
a couple of Bundles, and a case of Surgeon's Pocket Instruments

any thing wanted by yourself and Officers it shall be immediately
supplied. All the letters sent to Malta of last and this months date

SIR. I hasten to transmit the inclosed Copy of a Letter I have
received from the Grand Chancellor of this Em ire, in answer to
M ofEcid note I addressed him on the Subject o the fatal disaster
which hes befel a Frigate of our Government in the Mediterranean.
The interest which his Imperial Majesty has deigned on this occasion
so honorably to testify, cannot fail to be a Subject of the highest
felicitrttion to every American, and the more, as so important and
gracious an intercession, is calculated to lead to presages equdy
aue icious.
?ou will embrace Sir, the earliest means to transmit the inclosed
Letter to the Commander of the Squadron, and unless you are sble
to forward it immediately, its importance justifies you to dispatch
a Special Messenger to that effect, except on its receipt, ypu ase
apprised, that effectual measures have been otherwise taken to hberate
the Ship & Crew.

It is with great pleasure I announce to y?u that his Imperial

make the Strongest representation to the Turkish Court in order that

These orders Sir; will be expedited to Constantinople by the first

I have r e d a Letter from my Agent Mr Gibbs at Palermo,
dated Feb. 23'@ enclosing me a co y of a Letter from Commodore
Preble, requesting Gun Boats & ortars: & also a Letter from the
Party who Acts for the U. S. S uadron at Syracuse, giving an Account
of the fortunate event of the estruction of the Frigate Philadelphia,
in the Harbor of Tripoli: As you will have, no doubt, receo the particulars by Various means 'tis unnecessary to take up your time farther
on this Subject.
In regard to the request of Commodore Preble for Gun Boats, &
Mortars -tho' my interfering was not very pleasant on two Accounts,
yet I did not delay one Moment to reply, & offer him my persond
Services with the Neapolitan Govt and any Sum of money he might
want that I could command -: The Success & prosperity of our
Country's cause being in my opinion paramount to all other considerations, I need not, I am Sensible Sir,take up much of your time in
Stating the Aukward and unpleasant redicament in which I am
placed.--l't17 An application to Genera Acton to induce him to Assist
the Americans with Gun Boats, Mortars & when no rep1 had been made
to his Overtures for More than twelve months certa' y came forward
with a bad grace. 2ng'7 I am not even known as Agent for the
SQvadron, tho' Consul for Sicily, as Englishmen and Italians are
appointed by some person or other, but by whom I do not knuw;
nor, should I have been applied to on this affair but from supposing
I might have some weeht with General Acton, And knowing that I
could command a considerable sum of money of my own; as well as
obtain any further Sum that may be wanting. Commodore Preble is to be in Naples on the first of April; I have
written General Acton, and made the best apology I could for not
having answered his former propositions: I have also written
Commodore Preble, that should he think it requisite I will join him on
the Shortest notice - Had I, Sir, been Possessed of the Same powers
which the Consuls of all other Nations are; Commodore Preble would
have had the Gun Boats, & Mortars, & all other Matters he wanted,
more than a Month past - After various fruitless applications in
Sicily he is Obliged to go to Naples, which is consequently a considerable sacrifice of time & Public Money; exclusive of the risk of
Some of the Barbarians getting out. I flatter m self however he will
Succeed in obtaining the Gun-Boats & Mortars, &otwithstanding the
difficulties which have Occurred: I shall use every exertion in my
power. * * :

before pre88nting myself on the 27't I obtained an Audience of the

when I informed bim of the lively interest the first Co~fed

took in the destiny of the American Prisionm, and of his desire soon
to hear of their deliverance, and of a solid and advantageous peace
between the two parties - The Prince answered me, h t he was
delighted with the intervention of the First Consul in the &air, and
in Consideration of which, he would not avail himself of all the advantages which the chances of War had given him - He advised me
to persuade you, to send on shore, the Prisioner taken on board the
Phzladelphk, in order to interogate him freely, as it respects the treatment he has received - also that of his Comrades, and destroy the
eneral Credited opinion among the inhabitants that the have been
!hassacred - The Bashaw was very much astonish to see me
return without bringing this Man - and more so was Sidi Mohammet
Dghies, his rime Minister, who had suggested & advised this, favor
but to faceitate your interest - by the good effects the liberai
release of this prisioner would have in the Negociation without any
kind of prejudice to you - I assure you from my own knowledge
how much this condescention on your part, would facilitate obstacles,
and not pass without Compensation - I once more invite you Sir,
to accede to this necessary measure, and you will afterwards receive
permission to land, the Medicine C l o t h , and the Provissions for
the OfEicers You ask'd me when I was on board what I thought would be the
price of the Regency for the Ransom of the Prisioners? I here repeat
to you I think adviseable for both parties to treat of Peace and Ransom
a t the same time, in so much as the Bashaw intends it should be so,
and will never agree to give up the P d o n e r s before having received
the sum agreed upon, whatever shall be the guarantee they may offer
him, that the exorbitant sum demanded, and obtained a t *em
of
the Portuguese, the Negociation of M' Schembri, supported b the
testimony of the English pro-Consul, the Convention made wi& the
Batavians in perfect peace, & in presence of a strong Squadron, the
Agreement made with Sweeden for a Small number of prisioners taken
in the service of Commerce, the Nulity of a Carteel of Exchange
(as the Regency's of Barbary are accustomed to recover from such
Colours, from which the Enemy, take Tripoline Subjects & merchandize), all the preparations made against every attack whatever, all
these Considerations make me fear, that the Bashaws pretentions
will be a t least 500,000 Dollars On my return from the Frigate I did not fail to inform the prince
what were your approaching and formidable resources, of the attack
you intend to take, in case there is no hope of a reasonable accomodation - that you intend to send a Ship to Alexandria, to bring down
his Brother Sidi Acmet and firmly establish h i a t Bengaza - that
the U. States do not solict for Peace, they desire only to treat for the
deliverance of Prisionen by means of a Ransom that should not be
too exorbitant, that they would sooner sacrifice these Prisioners than
subscribe, or submit, to Conditions incompatible with the honor and
dignity of the Nation, that they do not intend to pay an thing for
Peace, nor to imitate those powers who pay them annual ributes that in the present instance, they only intend to treat for the Ransom
of riaionen, and that the present Consul shall not be refused in case
of eace I t did not a pear to me that these resolutions had any i m p d o n
on the epirit o the Bashaw - I suggested that too much tenacity on

his part in these exorbitant pretentions, might displease the first Consul; to which he answered whatever deference that ays to the desires
of his Friend Buonaparte, he cannot believe that e will divest him

E

of the advantages acquired by the Chances of War of three years
without intermission - and as to the rest he was ready to defend himself, being in no fear of the threats of placing his Brother on the
Throne, & to occasion a Civil War - Since he only sent him from his
Governm[ent] a t Derne, because he had began to Vex & discontent the
people, but not from dread of any injury he might be able to do - he
added his Brother was without means, inclined to drunkeness and
incapable of acquiring partizans, all these assertions are truths Perceiving that these Conferences fatigued the Prince, I took my
leave, and retired, to be renewed when I receive your answer I thought Sir, It would not be my duty to conceal from you, a11
that has been said, on each side in the two Conferences which I have
had with the Bashaw -that you may regulate our conduct thereby
after mature reflection & deliberation I oug t to inform you, that
whatever be the Success of your efforts to chastise the regency, your
Government will have a great addition too the expence, without the
sdvantage of recovering the prisioners, who are shut up in the Castle,
from whence it will be impossible to facilitate or effect their escape and the more damage you cause to be done to the Country, the higher
will be their pretentions, be it from Avarice or from obstinacv, this a t
least, I have reason to apprehend - I cannot continue the functions
of arbitrator & conciliator, in shewin rcyself equitable, impartial and
a Friend to peace, except you enab e me to answer every objection
that they will not fail to make - The Blockade without doubt ought
to cease, to Merchant Vessels during the Nepociation Have you full power to act, and to Negotiate according to Circums f a m ? or, w
ill it be necessary to wait the Sanction of Government,
which could not foresee the Circumstance of 300 prisioners falling into
th power of the Regency - Being authorized yourself to determine
irrevocably, will i t require much time to arrive thus far? What is
the Maximum of the Sum that you can offer to conclude a Treaty of
Peace and to obtain a deliverance of the Prisioners
I cannot end this letter without begging you to accept the thanks
for the distinguished honor and politeness you shew'd me on board
