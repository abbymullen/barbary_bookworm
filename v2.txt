PHIL*
Jan7 I* 1802
SIRAS it never could have been the intentions of Congres to reduce
the Sailors ration in the U S. service, to that degree so as to create
great disatisfaction (& which I find has been the case since ma last)
for want of Correct information 1 must intrude upon you wit such
observations as I have been enabled to make during my term of
service
I am averse to every kind of waste & I have [not] found any retrenchement necessary except in the article of bread 14 oz being quite
sufficient
Under the former regulations 17'P beef was allow'd which in a
general way was seldom very good & when boil'd with the usual
weight of bone was barely sufficient for three meals which had to
make out of it the reduction of
was unnecessary; the beef put up
for the British Navy goes much farther than ours being better in
quality & does not waste so much in boiling the Pork is sdGcient, Fish
is justly excluded unless put up for a short period bein a perishable
article but Potatoes & Onions as well as every other kin of Vegetable
ought to be allowed whenever they can be procured upon reasonable
terms for as long a time as they m11 keep as very contributory to the
health of the Crew for we always observe that, soon after the assem-

seldom get & never put up to keed [keep] good for more than a few
weeks
I have no doubt but those few changes would save the feelings of
all the Commanders in the service who must otherwise be sujected to
the murmurs of the Crew from a scanty allowance - The soldier may
have his resources, but the sailor hath no subterfuge when pinched

I have drawn this day on you four Setts of Bills, in

N.B My reason for drawing the Bills in small Sums, was their
being mor easily negotiated, and to a greater advantage, than if
drawn for the whole, in one Sett - I put into this port to heave
down the ship and examine her Botton, the pilot having run her on a
rock coming out of Port Mahon [NDA photostat, Dale LB, 1801-1802.1

The arrangements of Congress relatively to the Navy, contemplating an extensive diminution of the Navy establishment, have imposed
upon me a very unpleasant task, that of dismissing a number of
meritorious officers. The G d e of which you have the command

not after her sale be any occasion

that your Commission will be considered as terminating on the 20

SIR, Since I had the Honor of writing to you, on the 3OtWctz - I t
is painful to me to state to you the caus of my being a t this place, on
the 7tQof Novr in Malaga Roads, M: Kirkpartick handed me a letter
[contents of which are referred to on page 615, "Naval Documents,
Barbary Wars", volume I], a copy of which you have herewith; t.he
gth Novl I sailed for Algiers & arrived there on the 14tQcompleted my
Business on the 15Q and sailed for Mahon, to know if there was any
truth in the said letter, I arrived there on the lgtQNovr and was put in
Quarantine for 15 days, I wrote the Governor [19 November 18011,
respecting the Infermation, that I had received, he sent his Secretary
alongside, to Inform me, that he had received my letter, and to assure
me, that he knew of no such transactions, as I complained of, but
would make strict enquiery into the Business and should he find there
was any such transactions going on, that I might rest assured that he
would put a stop to it he allso, informed me, from the enquiery that
had been made, since he received my letter, that there was a large
Xebeck mounting 34 Guns 12 & 9 pounders said to be purchaised for
the Bey of Tunis; that the Governor was determined not to suffer her
to leave the Port, untill good security was given that she was not for
the Bey of TripoIi; nor intended for that place. - from every Infermation that I could git I have no reason to beleave there has been any
such Transaction at Mahon as the letter describes. On the 3Ot+ Novr the wind being favourable to go out to Sea, I
gave orders accordingly, Coming out the Pilot run the ship on a rock;
I put into this place on the 6 t W t ? to examine her Botton, Yesterday
I had a look a t it, I am sorry to say, i t is much worse than I expected
the lower part of the stem & fore art of the Keel is intirely gone, the

ever since the Carpenters say she will have to remain so four or five
days more, before they will be able to complete their work - the

Owners should be satisfactoril indemnified therefor i t appears that
nothing hitherto has been d e k t i v e l done on the subject, though
seven days have elapsed, & altho' d d applications have been made
by the Super Cargo to the proper aut orit7 for such a decision: i t is
impossible for me, conformably with my mstructions, to leave this

last Convoy whic can be this Winter given to the American Merchantmen in the Mediterranean by the Squadron here - I t has been
thought my duty to communicate this Circumstance to the concern in
this Brig & Cargo, in conse uence of which the Super Cargo has come
to a resolution to abandon 0th Brig & Cargo to the authority which
has placed the sequester upon her, except he receive a settlement for
her Cargo in season, to put the Vessel under my Convoy: in which
case the question of dama es must necessarily become a claim of the
Government of the United tates I have given orders to all Americans
here to get under way with the first fair wind, the Brig in question
will a t least make an effort to respect the order, & if impeded, will be
abandoned, as I have above stated to be her resolution I have thought it incumbent on me to make to your Excellency this
statement with a desire & full confidence, that measures may be
ordered to prevent a step being taken which may throw an inauspicious commencement on a negotiation which seems about to open

I enclose herewith for your information an extract of a letter from

Commodore Dale [26 October 18011 in relation to the shipment of
provisions by the American packet -from which you will be informed
of the unjustifiable conduct of some person or ersons in New York in putting a private adventure on board a vesse taken up and chartered
entirely on public account - whereby she was not only manifes[t]ly
impeded in her sailing to the great injury of the public service - as
the U: S: squadron on the Mediterranean station was then in
want of provisions and on account of the non-arrival of this supply
in due course of time - resort was obhged to be had to purchasing
from his Britannick Majesty's stores - but the whole cargo was
brought into jeopardy and the integrity of the commander of the
squadron, & indeed of the government of the U: S: itself xnight have
been called in question.
the author or authors of this transaction ought to be punished.
I pray you therefore to state the case to Mr Livingston Distt Attorney - & if he is of opinion that damages can be recovered - place
the business a t once into his hands with directions to bring suit.
I enclose also a bill of lading of the cargo the ship carried out on
public account with Commodore Dale's certificate on the back stating
that several articles were short delivered - some damaged &g - to

conjunction with him &t the Bey of Tripoli, 1 expect the Squadron
will consist of four or ve Frigates and two Sloops of War. To Blockade Tripoli cum letly, so as to prevent all kind of communication by Sea, It will e absolutely Necessary to have three or
four Gun boats, constructed and fitted m such a manner as to carry
an 18 or 24 pounder, in the bow and a 9 or 12 do in the stern that
thirty men may live on Board & to row 20 or 24 Oars and to Sail well,
those Boats would prevent all the small craft from going in and
coming out, by keeping close in shore also prevent the enemys Gun
boats from coming out in a calm, to anoy your Ships when close in
shore, which they will do if you have no Boats of that kind, and may
Very possibly do your Ships considerable damage without having i t
in your power to do them any harm. To make an Attack on Tripoli, i t will be necessary to have one or
two Born Vessels well fitted, with them, the Gun boats, and the
Boab belonging to the Shi s, I think the place may be attacked with
little doubt of Success at east the Shiping, in the Harbour may be
Burnt, without much danger. My advice is, never to make an attack, on the town,or an attempt
to burn the Shiping in the Harbour without you are almost certain
of succeeding in the attempt, the consiquences attending a failure in
either case would be sireous, it would not only give them confidence
but experience, I would not even fire a t their Gun boats without
there was a great probality hitting them. - From every infermation
that I have been able to obtain since I have been in these seas i t is
not prudent to attempt any opperation, against Tripoli, or to close
Blockade it, until1 the first of April, but the sooner you Show your self
of[f] there the better, i t will prevent any corsairs from going out, in
that case our Merchant Ships will have nothing to fear; I think it will
be rudent to station one ship, off and about Tunis to prevent any

therefore to request that you will be p eased to engage immediately
250 barrels of pork - if it be not too late in the season. The following
process must be observed in putting i t up. All the legs -heads - and
hands must be excluded & the rest of the hog cut into pieces of 8 lb
each, so that 25 pieces will make a barrel; to have a sufficient quantity
of salt & salt petre, & the barrels must be made of seasoned heart of
white oak, and be well bound. The Hogs not to weigh less than 120

to obtain a contract in this way, you will please to engage of the best
merchantable pork t.he quantity mentioned, and let me know as early
as may be in which way you succeed, and a t what price, that I may
take order for making you the necessary remittance.
Messieurs Gibbs and Channing - your predecessors in office-are

The Secretary of the Navy in a letter addressed to the chairman of

"Under these acts - Contracts have been made for 8 frames - for
74 gun ships: -two of them under the appropriation of 200,000$ -the
execution of them as far as 6 frames - wdl i t is believed, be completed this winter. a considerable part of the timber necessary for six

N. H. Charlesto[w]n near Boston, phil*, Washington, & Norfolk, and
measures have been taken to procure ground a t New York for capacious building & dock yards, and progress is making in preparing
docks for receiving the timber."
I n his estimates for the year 1801, the Secretary of the Navy
estimated for the expences attending six 74 Gun ships and for completing navy yards, Docks and wharves - the sum of 500000 dollars;
and Congress by an act of the 3"' of March 1801, appropriated that
sum for those objects. out of this appropriation, there has been

I take this occasion to suggest the expediency of selling two of the
frigates retained in service by the "act providing for a naval peace
establishment & for other purposes." The frigates Adam and General
eeene are not constructed u on approved models for ships of war.
They would both make exce ent Merchantmen, & would no doubt
command a good price, and the proceeds of these sales might be applied to the purchase of smaller vessels, which may be employed to
more advantage, if we should be obliged to mamtam a naval force in
the Mediterranean for any length of time. - If Congress should
determine that the Adam & Geni Greene shall be sold, i t would be
well to authorise the president to apply the proceeds, either to the
purchase of smaller vessels or of Cannon & other naval stores, as in
the discretion of the Executive, may be thought the most advisable. Before I conclude I will take the liberty further to suggest that
the Navy ration, under the present establishment, has been found
inadequate & has created much murmur & discontent among the
seamen. - The allowance of meat has been too s m d , that of vegetables also - by cuttin off superfluities, the allowance of these
articles may be encrease to the proper quantity, & the ration be
supplied a t the present price. I would recommend the following
allowance,

With respect to the combination entered into b the sailors, it
would be extremely improper to deviate in the smaIfest degree from
the allowance of wages prescribed in the instructions to Capt. Murray.
That allowance was fixed with a view to the whole Navy, and cannot
be encreased on board of any one vessel, to the exclusion of the rest.
At Baltimore, Lt Sterrett procured a full crew in one day, and I have

I gave my opinion respecting attackmg Tripoli and the force that

suppose the commander that comes out to releive me will have the
necessary orders and force to bring the Bey of Tripoli to Submision
the Swedish Admiral is no way prepaired either to attack or close
Blockade Tripoli It is absolutely necessary to have three or four
Gun Boats, and one good Bum Vessel - The Bey has three or four
Gun Boats and several Gallies, should the Ships be close in shore in a
calm, they will come out and do them much dams e, without having
it in their power to do them any harm - Mr Cath an is very anxious

I had from him, that we shall agree very well, I had a very long conversation with him on the duty of a Marine Officer, & if he adheres
to what he informed Me, he intended to exact from the Marines, I
think they will be better treated than on board any of our Ships, he
says that one Marine OEcer is quite sficient for a frigate, but that
it is proper for the Commodore of the squadron to have two, in case
of an accident in the squadron, in which case, he can spare one, from
which I presume (if they do not build the 749) they d disband the
Captains, & which I hope will be the case, as there IS niether credit or
money to be got in the corps a t present, You'll please to send me on
the prices of the Marine Cloatbmg, & likewise of Dunlaps - Capt
Truxton informs me that he intends taking the command of the
Constitution as soon as she arrives a t Gibraltar, but did not say if he
intended to take me along with him, I rather expect that depends on

(Circular)
N. DEPT. 18 February 1802.Heremth you will receive your authority to subdue, seize and make
prize of a31 vessels goods & effects belonging to the Bey of Tripoli or to
his subjects, and also the statute upon which that authority is
founded. In executing the duties arising out of this commission, you will
attend to the following regulations & instructions. 1 - Your Commission extending solely and exclusively to the
vessels goods & effects belonging to the Be of Tripoli, or to his
subjects, you will bear in mind that the rig ta of all other nations
are to be duly respected: That we are a t peace and wish to continue
a t peace with them, and that an American Commander ought to be
as much distinguished for his attention & adherence to all the rights
of humanity & hospitality, as by his h e s s in support of the honor
of his country.
2 - You are to refrain from exercising the owers of capturing or
recapturing in waters within the Jurisdiction limits and under the
protection of any other nation, in order that their peace & sovereignt
may remain unviolated, and we shall scrupulously and without i n d d
genoe examine that conduct which shall bring us into collision with
any other power. 3. - All Tripolitan Veseels - Goods - and Effects captured in
virtue of your commission, are if practicable to be sent into some
Port in the United States, to be proceeded against and distributed
according to Law. -

4 -. All prizes sent into port must be accompanied by all Passes,
Charter-Parties, Commissions, Bills of Lading, Invoices, Letters and
other documents and writings found on board, which are to be directed
to the Judge of the District, to which such prize is ordered to proceed. 5-With respect to prisoners - if a Cartel can be established
with Tripoli to effect an exchange, i t must be done; if found impracticable, you
then dispose of the prisoners to any of the powers a t
war with Tri o ', with a reservation that they shall be restored to the
U. S: - in t e event of their demanding them, on an adjustment of
their difference with Tripoli. If neither of these plans can be effected,
you will dispose of the prisoners a t your discretion, so as not to be a t
any expence to the U: S. - reserving however some few of the most
prominent characters. 6. - You are as far as may be in your power, to aid, succour,
relieve & free any American public or private vessel attaked by the
Enemy. The most effectual plan for accomplishing the great object of maintaining a Squadron in the Mediterranean, which is the protection of
our commerce, will be to keep the enemy in Port by blockading the
places out of which they issue. Convoy must be given to our vessels
as far as it can be done consistently with this object. - Whenever it
is convenient to convoy, i t will be proper that as many vessels as
possible be collected, & not by affording convoy to the smaller part
of our Commerce, expose the greater part to capture: (- To the Inferior the following addition is made - to the last
sentence above, end5 "capture" however on these subjects and with
respect to the disposition of the Prisoners, & all other subjects not
herein expressly provided for, you are to take your directions from
the commanding officer on the station.)

SIR I have for this several days been down here waiting for a

Edward Preble, U. 8. Ravy

NEWYORE Febl$Otp 1802
SIR Since my last letter I have seen Cap4 Morris, and I have
taken a survey of the ship, I h d that she has been hove out her
Bottom caulked Keel new shod & that she has been new coppered,
her spar Deck has been raised four Inches, which I tbink is an improvement, and is wholly new, her work fore & aft ouhide & inside
is new from one plank below the wales to the gunwale, new chainwales & knees - Bull works new, Fore step new, Capstern new
partners of the capstern and coverings of two Hatchways new the
principal part of of the Beams for the gun deck will be new as well as
mosf of the plank, when she is finished. partners for the Fore &
Mainmast new, Fore Mast, Main Mast & Caps New, Fore, Main &
Cross Jack yards new - Jibb & flying Jibb Booms, F* Top Gall$
Yard, Spritsail yard, Main Topmast Cap, Head rails, Cat Heads &
Belfry new, and three new pumps ordered, the Cabbin, Ward room,
& all the store rooms have been broken up with the decks and are
yet to be finish, as well as a considerable part of the Gun deck. and
work above the spar deck, as many hands are employed aa can work
to advantage but I cannot think they will be able to finish so that the
painters can compleat their work in less than between three & four
weeks from this. The whole of the shingle Ballast is new and on
board and the ground tier of water casks stowed, The ship will be
rigged compleat by the last of next week, two pair of lower shrouds
& most of the running rigging are new as well as three cables & three
hawsers that are already made, She has a new launch & wants a new
Jolly Boat. I t is not possible for me to send you an exact acc' of
what is necessary in the Werent departments to equip the ship for
a Cruise until a survey has been had on the Medicine & Surgeons
instruments now on hand, as well as on the Masters stores, Gunners
& Boatswains carpenters, Armoers & coopers tools & stores to see
what oondition they are in, which cannot well be done at present as
the Surgeon is absent & no Gunner, Carpenter, armorer Sadmaker or
Cooper is yet appointed, as soon as the ship is ready to receive her
stores on board, and the officers of the Merent departments are here,
I will return you regular indents of every articles wanted for a Cruize,
Cap$ Morris has ordered eveq thing necessary to Equip the ship
exce t, the Stores for a cruise m the mean time, the utmost oconorng
shalfbe made use of in lting the ship I am not able to give my personal attendance a t present, as I am confined to my room sick, but
hope in a day or two to be able to go out again, my journey from
Portlant to this place was an undertalang - greater than my state
of Health would justif , and I am now suflering in consequence but
have no doubt my hea th will be restored if I can get to sea, which I
am very desirous of. The Adam is not well constructed for a frigate,
she is too narrow and sharp and draws too great a draught of water
for a ship of her Rate, she is over masted, and requires so much
Ballast to enable her to bear her canvass that she will not camy more
than tbree months provisions & stores and even with that quantity
is very much lumbered, but to counter-ballance those inconveniencies
she is said to be a remarkable fast sailer, and being a Light %ate
will answer well for the Medeterranem service The sett of guns 12
pounders which now belong to her are much too heavy for her, I wish

i

WARS WITH BARBARY POWmS

63

to be permitted to chmge them for Light twelves or ninm as there

[is] a plenty of such guns in the navy yard which have mostly been
discharged from the ships which have been sold, the Adam on her
last cruise canied 38 Guns I wish to be permitted to leave six of them
on shore, as I think 32 Guns as many as she is able to bear or as can
be made use of to advantage in action I also think it will be best to
take six pound cannon or 18 pound canonades in lieu of the nine
pounders she had on her quarter Deck, there are a plenty of such guns
as are wanted on hand here; The acct of officers attach'd to the ship
as mentioned in my last was r e d from the Na Agent but was incorrect, the Officers here a t present are Mr Lu ow acting as Lieu;,
Mr Trent, Master M' Johnson, Purser, Lr OBannan of the Marines.
Mr Henly Midshipman & Mr Boyd Surgeons Mate. Mr Marshall,
Surgeon is absent for a few days on leave given by Cap! Morris Mr
George Bills the present Acting Boatswain is on board he was Boatswain of her when Caps Morris commanded and is spoken very highly
of, I am much pleased with him myself, and hope you w i l l think proper
to forward him a warrant, as a good BoatswDis i s c u l t to be pmcured, and he does not incline to go to sea without a warrant. It
has become necessary to have a number of men attached to the ship,
at least a Crew for each of her boats in order to move the ship into
the stream in case of fire near her or to take care of her in a gale of
wind They may also be employ'd to advantage on board as we &all
soon be ready for our water & wet provisions. - if those men cannot
be conveniently accomodated on board the ship, t h y can be boarded
at a house a t the head of the Wharf where the ship is and their Monthly
Wages & board will not be so expensive to government as hiring men
by the day will be I hope you will order the Lieu'q here as soon as
convenient [LC.EPP, Vol. 4, 1801-1802.)

Danish Consul, Tripoli

TRIPOLIMarch l g t Q1802
D' SIR. Since my last of 34 ulto nothing has transpired worthy your
attention, I shall however give you an abstract of my Journd. The Bashaw expects the frigate former1 commanded by Murad
Raize & blockaded by the Ships of the nited States a t Gibraltar
from Tangiers with a Cargo of Grain, having sent an Ambassador to
solicit that fa-~or
from the Emperor of Morocco. 26'h jeb?. The Bashaw sent an order to all the Consuls to hoist
their flags in consequence of the Grand S i o r having taken Possession of Egypt again, a general discharge of Cannon took place from
all the fortifications. The %me day saiIed a Guerlinguich of 12 Guns the only Tripoline
Cruizer now at Sea. 2Ph dB Was launched a Xebeck of 18 Guns, which is to be fitted
out for a Cruizer. @@March. Waa hoisted for the h t time the Batavian flag without incurring any expence or even an promises being made to
the Bashaw. The same day the french itlzens began to wear the
three colour'd Cockade. The Swedish frigate continued to cruize off here when the Weather
permitted untill the 25 March when the Consul hoisted a Signal to
lnform the Commr that he wished to go on board, but the Bashaw
refused him Permission, saying that the Consul brought him no
Information from Col. Tornquist, when he was on board before and
that he was not informed whether Sweden wished for Peace $ that
probably they preferred War, The Bashaw suspected that had he
permitted him to go on board that he would not return, & the C o m d
then hoisted a S i a l > o fDistress but to no Purpose as the Frigate
Stood out to Sea & disappeared.
llt@
A@. A frigate a peared which was generally supposed to
be an bmerican, for sever3 days she turnJdaway vessels bound here
captured Sandals, or small coast' vessels & manned their long Boat
in order to cut them off from the S ore, this convinced me she wlts not

d

f

an American tho' she hoisted no colours whatever, for the Americans
have never acted offensively against the Sandals of Tunis & these
were all of that Regenc
On board of one of tgew Sandals were some Pamengers belonging
to a Maltese vessel that had been lost on the Island of Zerbi - one
of whom was the Aunt of Consul Luca's Wife who declared on her
arrival here that the frigate which captured her was the Swedish
Admiral's Ship
April 21" The frigate disappeared in consequence of the weather,
but it is reported that when She returns, that the Admiral intends
to Send his Boat on shore with an W c e r to o erate with the Consul
in order to commence a Negotiation with the ashaw. The Swedes certainly have behaved very extraordinarily in commencing Hostilities while their flag flies m Sign of existing Peace,
nevertheless the Bashaw treats the Prisoners & the Consul in the
usual way .Since the 31 March, I a m informed that the Swedes have solicited
the Govt of France to interpose their Mediation in the Arrangemt
of their affairs with the Barbary States, but I think the manner the
Swedish Frigate has treated the Tunisenes, firing on them &c will be
productive of a serious dis ute between Sweden & that Regency. April 22'J I t is curren y reported that the Bashaw intends to fit
out five Cruizers, three quarter Gallies a Guerlinguich or Polacre
that returned from a Cruize with a Prize a few da s ago & a Xebeck. The Bashaw has open'd & caused to be read
Consul Burstroems
Letters, whereby he was informed of Several thingsr which the Admiral
wish'd to keep Secret. This day the Swedish h a t e came close in
the Swedish & french flags were displayed. The Bashaw hoisted a
white flag in S i a l of a Truce, which was answered by the frigate,
who sent her boat & two Officers on Shore. The Frigate stood to
Sea in consequence of the weather & returnd on 27t@- The officers
returned on board & came on Shore again on the 28'@for a few hours.
The Admiral has declined coming on shore. The Swedes insist that
the terms of the treaty concluded by Mr Tornquist shaU be annulled
The Bashaw on his part will not admit of any considerable Alteration.
The Swedish Negotiation is kept more secret at present than is
generally the case at Tripoli, the whole is carried on between Consul
Burstroem, the French Consulate & Sidi Mahomet Daguize.
There is a report that the Capt. Bashaw is expected here from
Constantinople with five ships of war the Bashaw is arming all his
Subjects, without distinction of Persons, he has rohibited the Inhabitants of the town to leave it. Most of the aids or Governors
of Villages are changed & his Measures of defense are really calculated to make a vigorous defense by Land. This seems to indicate
that he dreads some other force more formidable than the Americans
& Swedes otherwise his chief attention would be pay'd to his fortifications in order to prevent an Attack by Sea from those visible
Enemies.
April 30. .I have to inform you that two Quarter Gallies of 28 Oars
each & four carriage Guns & 4 Swivels man'd with from 50 to 60 Men
each one commanded by Raiz Halifa & the other by Raiz Oman
Candiotto, are ready to aail upon a Cruize

belonging to the Bey of Tri oli - purchased there by his agent, and
that one of them had actua y sailed after completing my Business at
Algiers I Proceeded for Mahon and arrived there on the 19*QNovr I
wrote the Governor respecting the Infermation, that I had received,
he sent his Secretary alongside, to Inform me that he knew of no such
transaction, and that I might rest assured, nothing of the kind should
take place a t Mahon. - I lay there Eleven days (all the time in
Quarantine) from every Infermation I could get I have no reason tcs beleave there was any foundation for the Infermation that I received.On the 30t@I sailed with an intention to proceed to the U S. but the

prudent to examine the ships Bottom before I procee ed for the
U. S. - when the ship was Hove Keel out, I found that seven or eight
feet of the lower part of the stem was intirely gone and as many, of
the fore part of the Keel, Very much injured, so much so as to be under
the Necessity, to take it out, the ship lay ten days and nights Keel out,
it took the Carpenters that time to complete her Bottom. - Should
any of the Ships under your command meet with any accident of consiquence, I recommend Toulon s the Most proper place to repair it. I wrote the Secretary of the Navy my opinion fully res ecting the
force necessary to make an attack on Tripoli, with litt e doubt of
success also the force necessary to keep it in a constant state of close
Blockade, also the treatment to Tripoline Prisoners, I make no doubt
but you have seen, what I have said to the Secretary on that Subject,

orders, and I suppose will act accordingly - from my letters to the
Secretary he cannot suppose that you will meet with me i n the Mediterranean Should you have orders to make an attack o n Tripoli or
to close Blockade it, I t will be absolutely Necessary that you have
three or four Good Gun Boats to carry a 24 pounder each (those Boats
may be got a t Algezirtts) also a good Bom Vessel -, those Boats will
prevent the Enimys Boats from coming out in a calm (which they will
do if any of your ships should be close in shore, and may do them much
damage, without having i t in their power to do them any harm) also
prevent all Small Vessels from going in by keeping close in Shore, they
may be sent into the Harbour with the Ships Boats, to Burn the shiping, which may be done without much danger by taking a proper night
and time for the Business. - I recommend that you get a ood Blot
for the Coast of Barbary, Should you meet with the ~ h d a d e f ~ h iyou

Should you wish to have any communication with the Bey, Hoist a red

by W as there is a sand bank laying some distance from

danger (I am told it is not safe to Anchor before Tripoli untill the
Middle of April, or the first of May the Notherly Winds blow strong,
an a Very Heavy Sea on Shore (at times) before that time) which
makes it Very dangerous to Anchor, - Cap$MFNiell in the US Ship

NORFOLK
3rd March, 1803.
SIRI am honored with your letter of the 23rd ult. The copper is
put on the bottom of the Chesapeake wrong as I reported and Fox as
well as those concerned are sensible of it. The construction of the
hawse-holes have had in this ship no tendency to hurt the cables. I
examined them when I first discovered the cables to be in a ragged
state and h d i n g they were not the cause of the damage I was led to an
examination of the bottom and observed the sheets to be lapped the
wrong way. There are but very few men here and of course the progress made in recruiting is slow.
I have and shall continue to make all exertions possible to man the
shi in the shortest time possible, but for 100 men we must depend on
~ & i m o r e or on Baltimore and Philadelphia for with less than that
number she cannot go from hence in a long time and i t is but right
you should know this in order to take your measures accordingly. I
note what you say of Captain CampbeU, if he cannot go, I trust you u d l
send Rodgers* or some other of capability. The officers destined for
this ship are all young and very inexperienced and though in due time
may be clever they are deficient a t present and the task for me on the
intended service would be too severe without some aid and I have had
heretofore much trouble in organizing a squadron and st the same
time attending all the duty in detail on board m own Ship. Under
these circumstances and M n g a reputalian to ose which I am a e y
tenacious of, 1
conside.r myself wanting i n that dvty which I awe
to myself and to my family I was to roceed without being placed in a
6.itualimr similar to the Comma& ofihe Squad~mnow i n the Mediterranean and if tAia cannot be done I must beg leave to quit th.e 8ervice.i
The officer I wrote you was here and requested to h o w if you would
re-instate as a Lieutenant has the command of a ship and now declines going. On the return of the Chesa.peake I advise your having
the copper taken off her bottom and menbon this now lest it should be
unattended to by others if I do not proceed on the expedition. I
am very busy this morning and write you in great hash.

March k h 1802
SIR On the 31* of Jan? the United States Ship [George] Washington
arrived here from Tunis m d Naples & sail'd in a few days with all the
merchant vessels under her convoy that were ready to depart, we have
since heard of her safe arrival a t Mersaiiles, The President has been
thoroughly repair'd a t Toulon & has sail'd for Gibraltar, I presume
to a w a t the arrival of the other squadron which we expect hourly,
Mr Eaton arrived in the Washington & remain'd here untll the 2StQof
Febv he touches a t Naples to determine a point of some importance
full details of which is forwarded by him to the department of State
by this conveyance, he proceeds from thence direct to Tunis, the day
before his departure from Leghorn he rec@letters from Mr Turner
S eon of the Philadel hia whom he left encharged with our affairs
a t unis which inform' him that no alteration had taken place since
his de arture from his Post.
Enc osed I send you copys of the latest intelligence from Tripoli;
I shall offer no comment a t present but beg leave to observe that we
have been fortunate beyond precedent or our most sanguine expectstions, the very elements seem to have declared in our favor, & If government thinks proper to decree the destruction of Tripoli for the
iniquity of their Bashaw, never did, & probably never will so favorable
an opportunity present itse!f The Swedish Rear Admiral Cederstroem arrived here some days
since, he had been a t Toulon to consult with Comodore Dale, the
result I am not inform'd, but from the circumstance of his taking on
board here a large quantity of cash I presume he will act similar to
the Danes I n anxious expectation to receive instructions from the President,
I beg leave to subscribe myself very respectfully

SIR By my last respects to you of the 26th Ult. you must have
counted upon my being a t Sea this Day which would certainly have
been the case, but we have had such uncommon bad weather since
we came over the Bar, that notwithstanding Mr Harrisons great
exertions, as well as my own to embark our Stores, we could not et
them all down till within these two days, & the having [heavy] Ga es
of Wind now revent the Shallops coming alongside to discharge,
tho every artic e is now down We had yesterday a very he& Gale in which we had the Misfortune to part our best Bower able, & with dificulty brought up
with the Sbeet Anchor, this is a serious loss to us, for I fear we shall
not be able to recover our Anchor as the Buoy hath sunk, I doubt
much if it can be replaced in Philadelphia being 45 Cwi but I have
sent up to enquire about it & as soon as the weather moderates shall
grapple for it If I do not succeed in either case I must proceed on to Gibralter, &
endeavour to replace it there but in the event of a disappointment I
wish it were possible to send one after me by any of our Public Vessels
that may be comeing after us I t appears there is no end to our embarresments for. in consequence
of the excessive bad weather since we began to recelve our men on
board, and unavoidably exposed to wet, & Cold, without a chance to
dry their Cloathing, we have now near fifty men on the sick List, &
two have died, tho I have no doubt if we get soon to Sea, but they will

proceed to the Bay of Tangier, from there to Tripoli. You wiII please to Inform his Imperial Majesty that it will always
give me pleasure to comply with with his requests, when i t is consistant, with my duty and Honor, becaus I know it is the wish of the
President of the Unlted States to keep up that good understanding
and friendship, which has subsisted so long between him and his
Imperial Majesty, I am well persuaded if His Majesty was fully
acquainted, with the Proceedings of the Bey of Tripoli against the
US. without any caus on the part of the United States that he would
not wish me to give a Passport to a Ship of War belonging to the
Bey of Tripoli, Sent to Sea, for the sole urpose of capturing Vessels
belonging to my Nation. - You will p ease to Inform his Majesty
that I am confident it is not the wish of the President to continue the
War with the Bey of Tripoli when ever he may show a disposition, to
cease in his unjust demands from the U S. also a disposit~onto treat
for a lasting peace, I am confident he will always find the president
ready to meet him on friendly terms. - When I was off Tripoli I
wrote to the Bey, to know his reasons for going to war with the U S.
and on what terms he expected to make peace He did not reply in
point to either. You will please to Inform his Imperial Majesty, that I beg he will
excuse me for not complying with his request, it ~snot in my power

of t m e , to do away if possible those unjust Ideas that the Tripoline
Ambassador has empressed on his mind, in favour of his Master, to
the prejudice of the United States, from the contents of your letters
it appears to me that the Emperor is desided in taking part with the
Bey of Tripoli, how far he intends to go I cannot tell, it ~svery much,
to be dreaded, his going to war with the United States, he can do us
more Injury than all the other powers put togeather, therefore we
must do every thing we can to keep peace with him. - I shall sail
the first fair wind for the United States, I expect a S uadron will
arrive here in all this Month from the US, I suppose the ommanding
Officer will have full power to act in ma
a peace or otherwise. I was told two days ago by a Captain, who eft B~ltimoreon the first
of Febuary - the US. Schooner Enterprize was to sail in a day or two
with Dispatches, bound to Leghorn I have received no accounts from
Government, I have been expected home, for several months past - I
shall leave copys of your letters with Mr Gavino for the Commander
of the next Squadron. - he may have orders, that such Infermation
may be very usefull to him, you will lodge every Infermation that
ou may receive from time to time respecting the Movements of the

I have received with real concern your letter of the 3 instant notifying your determination to quit the service unless you can have an
additional Captain to command your ship under you. The condition
Sir, is impossible. I t is well known that from the reduction of the
officers in pursuance of the Act of Congress of the last Session, there is
not a t this time within the U: S: - a Captain of the Navy whom we
could require to take a secondary station on board a Ship. As this
must have been known to you - I cannot but consider our notiiication as absolute. It is to be regretted that it had not een made a t
an earlier eriod so as to have allowed me to ask from you a reconsideration of t e subject: But a t this moment when the ship is almost
ready to depart - neither the object of her destination - nor the
expences of the delay will allow time for negotiation. - I would presume too that you had deliberately viewed the case under all its aspects
and that no considerations which I could present - would be new to
your mind. I t remains then for me, however reluctantly - to acquiesce in your determination - and to lessen, as much as possible the
expence and injury which such a noeification a t this point of time ma?
occasion, by dispatching, as I have done - orders to Captain Morns

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 180B TO 1803
To Secretary of the Bavy from Daniel Ladlow, Navy Agent,
Bew Yark, 8. Y.

NEW YORK

March 1802

S~arAgreeable to your directions of the 2 2 g UltQ,I have the honor

to transmit you a plan of the Navy Grounds on Long Island, on a
large scale, & the better to enable you to f o m an Opinion of their
ositio~,I have annexed a very correct Plan of the City & Port of
Gew York, you have likewise an estimate of the Expences that would
attend the necessary Buildings kc, to put the yard in the order, to
render it serviceable to Government, either for building or repairing
Ships; The Map will exhibit the depth of Water & improvements
made, the latter only consists of part of the Dock contemplated, &
the foundation for the New Store, the materials, say Brick, Lime,
Slate &c, are all layed in, I am ready to progress & compleat the
building by the h t of June; under the idea that i t was your intention
& c e r t d it was the interest of Government, that the Store should
be finishe as soon as possible, I have moved over from the old Grounds
to Long Island, aU the Navy Timber, sold a t Auction all the small
buildings erected thereon b Government, given up the hire of all the
Stores in the City, contemp ating by the first of May to have sufficient
room finished in the New Store to contain all Government property
on hand & thereby make a saving of $2682 pr Ann - If it IS not
the intention of Government to progress in hishing thk New Store,
I have to request as speedy Notme as possible that I may in season
rovide a place of deposit for the different Articles belonging to the
bepartment, this object, I beg leave to impress you with the necessity
of an early decission on: The uality of the water at the yard is Salt,
the Tide rising & falling about ight feet, the Worms in the Months
of July & August do injury to all Timber;. this is an evil generally
experienced in all our sea Ports. The Mdl Pond will compleatly
answer for Docking the Timber, which may most effectually be preserved against the Worm, by the water bemg let out daily with the
Tide, the Timber thereby being exposed to the Sun & Air, the worm
will take no hold or be lulled, when they [word illegible] on this point
no doubts exist; The Timber a t present lays on the beach waiting
permanent arrangements to be adopted for its preservation
Having contracted for the completion of the Dock contemplated
a t 22 50/100 P' foot excepting Ironwork, & earth filling, I am waiting
your instruchons to proceed. If the improvements I have detailed
should be compleated it will be the first Naval Yard on the Continent;
in my estimate I think I am rather above than under the cost; If a
permanent Navy Yard with the proper arrangement is necessary a t
all, the expence Government will be put to will undoubtedly prove
true Occonomy, on this subject I should suppose there can hardly
exist a difEerence of opinion with the Gentlemen of the Committee
when they take a view of the heavy past expence Government has
been put to for the want of permanent Yards on a correct & proper
scale.
Any further elucidation on this important point that is possible for
me to bestow will be most cheerfully and candidly put forward on
your suggesting to me the pointa of information necewbv: the Map
of the Hnrbour of New York, I have borrowed & b e 3 the only
correct view existing, I have engaged to return it, you
therefore
please to bear my request in mind.

[17 March 18021
To Secretary of the Navy from George Harrison, Navy Agent,
Philadelphia, Pa.

SIR Agreeably to your order of the 22g Ulto I have forwarded by
this mail a complete plat of the Ground occupied as a Navy Yard,
describing the courses, distances, & quantity of ground purchased,
& the situation of the buildings thereon, with the depth of water
&Q
- I t cannot be said that any improvements have been made in
the Yard, The Old buildings on the Lot, when the purchase was
made, consisted of a small one story Log House & stone Kitchen, on
the old wharf, originally built for a Block House & Magazine, these
were fitted up for a counting house for the Constructor - A small
two story frame House, & a one storytrame w o ~ kshop, fitted up for
Barracks for the guard; a small Bnck bulldlng occupied by the
Commf Officer - A frame joiners shop, & store, removed from the
former Yard - these are all the buildings Some dirt & ballast stones have been hauled on the low ground &
some leveling done I t is believed that Timber may be preseryed any length of time
under water, & will receive a seasoning accord-mgly. The water here
being perfectly fresh, i t is free from the manne worm, the Average
rise of Tide is Six feet For the preservation of the Timber now on hand, and expected, i t
will be necessary to build a complete Dock, to keep the Water on the
Timber, & to keep the water out, when i t may be necessary to take
Timber out, or clean the Dock; from an Estimate handed me, by an
experienced wharf Builder, this will cost from 10 to 12 m$ to which
1/3q may be added, Estimates are generally this proportion below

90

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1802 T O 1803

what finally appears the actud cost - this improvement is all that
may be necessary a t present, to preserve the Timber - All the
Live Oak for the 74 Gun ship, to be built here, is nearly covered a t
high tide, but the water soon leaves some of this timber, & the situation is by no means as proper as could be wishd for, but it is the best
that is to be had in the present situation of the yard & will be tolerably
preserved untill a fitter place can be prepared to receive it; - several
random pieces for occasional purposes are on dry land, they would be
better in the water, but it would take up the only room that is left
to receive the live oak now expected, without it is placed where the
Dock is contemplated, from whence it will be to remove whenever this
work is began - The keel pieces Keelson, Deadwood, wales $4 lay
in a very bad situation, & wlll soon spoil, part in & part out of the
water a t high tide, neither can this be remedied in the present situation of the Yard - to prevent it that part of the Dock should be
log'd up - it can be imrnr done - The Gun carriage stuff is now
exposed to the weather - it should be cover'd with sheds, & kept
from the Sun & air as much as possible - I have noticed all the
Timber that calls for immediate attention, for the remainder, I beg
leave to refer you to the return made by ME Humphrys, which I
receipted If ~t should be thought expedient to commence the building of the
74, in two years from this, I am well informed, that it wiU be necessary
to commence building the pier on which the ship should be raised,
immediately, in order to give time for the ground to settle - in the
Setting so large a Ship on the Stocks, it is absolutely necessary that
she should have a certain degree of declivity, s a c i e n t to make her
Start for Launching & a t the same time not to give her too much
velocity, if the Ground is not settled, the point cannot be ascertained
with any degree of precission, & may be attended with disagreeable
consequences Should you not deem it proper to order a dock to be constructed in
this Yard - Shed's might be erected for the preservation of the
Timber, a t an Expence of about 3000$ & by keeping sun & air from
the Timber & strewing Salt between y9 timber as its piled away it will
be very well presemed, tho' not as well as it is supposed, as by being
ke t under water $or further information, on the subject of this Yard, I beg leave to
refer you to the report, made by your request, by Messrg Jones Penrose

his passage to the Kingdom of Tripoli I should give it to have him and
his retinue carried prisoners of war to the United Statea; but if he
would adhere to his former arrangements I did not doubt but that
before the expiration of four months he might be offered to his people
by an American Squadron. I tell him the sole object of his brother
is to cut his throat. He is Sufficiently alarmed & too much distressed,
this Bey having refused him any further supplies of provisions (I
don't like this Symptom) He proposes going to Malta and waiting the
issue there. I will only consent to his going to Leghorn or Sardinia If he de arts on other terms I shall send an armed Ship after him, &
if possib e carry him and retinue to some Italian Port.
Contrary winds prevented my touching a t Naples from Leghorn It is a misfortune; but affairs demanded me here - Cap? MqNeill
touched here 29. J a m ? since which we have no advise of him. P. S. March 26. The Bashaw of Tripoli has manifested an unequivocal disposition to
come into my plans heretofore detailed; he is assured of a revolution
in his favor If he can be offered to his people with Sufficient show of
force: but he is surrounded by Turks and Arabs Subjects of his

1gt3 March 1802 SIR * * * * * * Commodore Dale wrote me from Gibraltar, that
he could not grant any Passport for the Tripoline Ship laying there,
without first obtainin permission from the President of the United
States. - I am hig y sensible of the very great impropriety of
Muley Soliman makeing such a request, but with him i t is not proper
to speak all we think; for this reason, rather than impart Commodore
Dales determination, in the terms he recommended, I have thought
better to intimate to this Government, that as that Gentleman was
on the point of quiting this Station, when he received my Letter on
subject of His Majest s request, that he left the decision of the matter
to his Successor and t e Swedish Admiral, as he could not have any opportunity of communicating with Adml Cederstrom on the subject.This has satisfied them in the moment, & I hope either Peace with
Tripoly, or some other circumstance may happen, to do away the
necess~tyof an farther Negotiations on that topic. - At all events
it certainly is est, should the request be ultimately found such as
cannot be granted? that Sweden join in the refusal, as it can do no
good that the United States come forward alone with such, before
Admiral Cederstroms sentiments be known. - I confirm that Muley
Soliman has agreed to allow Wheat, to be sent from his Count to
Tri ly, but I should think it will be next to an impossibiiy for x e m
to E d Vessels to Charter for that Voyage, whilst that Port is so notoriously known to be blockaded; whatever may be done in this

he seems to entertain towards the ~ r i ~ o % e swill be sensible, that is an undertakemg totally out of my power,
without being authorised thereto by the President of the United
States, and provision made for the unavoidable expence must attend
such a visit. - At this moment in particular, such a measure is by
no means necessary; for the Swedish Mission happening now, affords
Mr Wyk an opportunity of doing all I possibly could; - to that end
the matter was fully deliberated on between us before his departure,
and he assured me he would use his utmost endeavours to convince
Muley Soliman, of the impropriety of his takeing the the part he had
done in behalf of the Tripolines, in a War which they have so unjustly
made against Sweden & the United States. - * * *

the Schooner Enterprize - Sterrett, you will also find on that station,
& they are to remain under your command, & the frigate Adams Preble will be sent out to join you as soon as she can be prepared. One of your first objects on your arrival in the Mediterranean will
be to see the Commanding Officer - and confer with him on all
points relating to his cruize. He will communicate to you information
which may serve you essentially in your future operations. I shall not point out to you the ground you are to occupy in the

a frequent change in your position and we have a perfect confidence
that you will provide judiciously against every movement of the

It is presumed that you can procure every thing else either at Gibraltar,
Leghorn, Malta, Minorca, Saragossa in Sicily or wherever you may
go. The latter has been mentioned by Commodore Dale, as a good

NAV:DEP: 6 Apfil1802.-

The Lazarettos in the Mediterranean, are, I believe, very justly
considered as the graves of all foreigners who are so unfortunate as
to be obliged to enter them. I deem it therefore necessary to lodge with you a discretionary
power to establish a temporary hospital in some one of the most
healthy ports of the Mediterranean, rf you can obtain permission so
to do, and it should appear to you an adviseable measure. - Syracuse would probably be an excellent place for such an institution as it
lies in the vicinity of Tripoli, and is healthy. I t is left to you however
to select the place that ou may under all circumstances, consider the
best. In the event o your establishing such an institution, you
must commit the direction of it to one of the Surgeons of the fleet,
of rofessional skill & allow him a Mate. Doctor Davis would
pro ably be pleased with the appointment and I should have no
objection to it. It appears to me that the establishment of an Hospital, in the
event of their being sick persons enough to justify it, is powerfully
recommended by econom as well as humanity, & we are corfidently
assured that you will not ose sight of either of these considerations. You will have funds enough to provide every article of hos ital
stores, which the Superintendmg Surgeon of the institution may eem
necessary. -

improvements as appear necessary to be made if it is intended by
the Government a t this time to build up a Navy Yard, which may
afford all the requisite conveniences for the purpose of building up &
keeping a Navy.
The plat of the Land is in three divisions; the fbst is South of the
Bason and contains nine Acres on which there is Six Buildings four
of which were erected by the United States - In one of them the
Live Oak Timber is deposited, one covers a large Saw pit and has
been used for the Stonng of Water Casks &c; another is used as
a Barrack for the Guard Kept in the Yard - the other is used for a
Carpenters Shop. The fifth was built on Rent before the ground
was bought for the United States, which has since been purchased of
the proprietor, and is used for a Blacksmiths shop - The sixth was
bought with the Ground purchased of John H a , , and is occupied
by Laborers employed in the Yard. In this division the S t d l that
has been taken from the Bason for the use of the Frigate CMitutimc
has been lodged and piled up, and also the Bricks & Stone purchased
by the late Agents for building of Stores. Cannon, Shot, Iron Ballast
&c sre likeme there deposited. The Oxen purchased for the use
of the Yard were supported the last season in part by the Grass it
produced.
The second Division is the Bason which contains Nine Acres &
three fourths & twenty six poles, and is covered in front by a Cob
Wharf of one Thousand feet long, twenty broad & about eleven deep
on an average, where the Timber, Plank &c are deposited and overflowed by Sea Water every tide, and are perfect1 secured against
any loss from tides or storms. It has a passage t ough it covared
by a Bridge for the convenience of letting into the Bason such articles
as may be directed to be lodged there or removed from thence; and
a part of the Wharf is prepared to receive any articles it may be
necessary to deliver into the Yard or that may be taken from thence
in Boats Scows or Vessels. All the Timber that has been received
there is docked in the Bason excepting such as has been taken from
thence for the use of the Frigate Cmtitu4wn and the Live oak which
is covered from the weather.
The depth of Water in the Bason is from three to nine feet. Its
quality I concieve cannot vary much from Sea Water as the Bason
is only three leagues from the Ocean and the usual ebb of the Sea
here is ten feet - the only fresh water of any consequence that falls
into the harbour issues from Charles & Mistick Rivers, both of which
are flat Rivers and afTord but small streams. The water it is understood hardens the Timber and destroys tbe acid it contains which is
destructive to it in codbed and impure air.

$

108

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1802 TO 1803

The third Division is the land North of the Bason and contains
twenty four acres and one fourth from which no advantage has been
derived excepting the Grass i t produced the last season which served
also in part to support the oxen employed in the Yard.
The improvements proposed b the plan are extensive, but if the
necessity of sinking the front of t e ier in a depth of water sufficient
to float Ships of the Line a t Low b a t , is taken into view and a
Building Yard of Six Hundred & forty feet in front and Three Dry
Docks are presumed to be necessary for the Yard the plan will not
perhaps admit of much diminution - The tenor of your Letter of the
2otQ of August last on this subject will I hope just& my submitting
improvements so extensive.
The form of the plan is controuled by the course of the Channel
and the various depths of water contiguous: and the front of the
Building Yard, from an impression of the expediency of Building
Ships as near the Water as possible, is carried down to ten feet of
Water a t Low water. The usual ebb of the Sea as has been before
observed is ten feet and from twelve to fourteen a t Spring tides. The Sternpost of a Ship of the Line may therefore be erected within
thirty feet of twenty four feet of water a t full Tides. h the forming of the entrance into the Dry Docks in ten feet of
water a t low water must be very e ensive, a Canal is proposed by
the plm to lead into a Bason of S cient extent for the purpose of
letting any Ship pass into the Docks by which the Expence of forming
the entrance into two Docks will be avoided, if three [?] should not
be thought too many.
Seven Stores are shown on the plan, one placed on the upland of
One Hundred and thirty feet by forty agreeable to our Letter of
the 20 August, and six of One Hundred feet by fifty - hree of which,
that is, the store of one hundred & thirty feet and two of an hundred
feet will probably be sufficient for all the purposes of the Yard for
some time yet to come.
The Cob Wharf will be rendered useless if the Plan submitted
should be adopted - The Bason b forming an uniform bottom,
supporting its sides with a Stone Wa 1, and making such divisions in
i t for the purpose of separating the various sorts of Timber &c deposited therein, would probably be much improved. This Work that is the Navy Yard cannot probably be completed
under Six Years. The Cost according to the Estimate inclosed will
be $650,000 Dollars. The several Articles that compose it will not
I beleive be found to be far from the truth, if the work should be
executed agreeable to the Plan submitted, excepting the sum allowed
for the Dry Docks, which is altogether presumptive having neither
precedent, nor the experience of any one to aid me therein - these
must of course be expensive as their Bottoms must be placed ten
feet a t least below the surface of the water a t low water mark - as
it will require twenty feet a t least I presume to carry a Seventy four
Gun Ship into a Dry Dock. -

PORTSM~
A p d Y* 1809
SIRImmediately on receiving yours of the 22d of February last, I
em loyed a person to take a plan of the Navy Yard here, which is
enc osed herein, and also a seperate plan of the river, on a smaller
scale, from Portsmouth to the sea, exhibiting a view of the adjacent
waters & land. I could not possibl procure those plans untll this
day or should have transmitted t em sooner. The plan of the
Navy Yard will shew the quantity of ground i t contains, the improvements thereon & the docks adjoining & the depth of water in feet a t
low water. As the Navy Yard is within two miles & a half of the
o en sea the water is of the same quality. The tide flows a t the yard
a out ten feet in common tides, a t s p m g tides, about fourteen feet.
The timber & plank in the docks are covered with saltwater about
three quarters of the time, but the water leaves them on the flats or
mud, a t low water - If a ship or ships should be built, it will I
think be further necessary to erect a warehouse of about 100 feet in
length, 30 ft wide, & two stories high also a blacksmith's shop of
sixty feet long & 30 feet wide, with a small store adjoining it, for
depositin iron & coals, also some additional barracks, the probable
cost of adwhich will be about 15000 D" if built of wood as those are
which are alread erected, and will be so placed, that if one takea
fire i t will not be &ely to communicate to any other. But if it should

P

g

1

110

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1802 TO 1803

be thought best to build them with stone or brick the cost will be
greater The objections made by some to the Navy Yard as I mentioned to you at Washington, are la.' That it is situated too nigh the
the sea, & consequently more exposed to an enemy than if i t was
further up the river; 2a That i t is too nigh Seavey's island, &
there miqht be some danger in a large s s p sailing. from thence; &
3@That ~t is too far from Portsmouth belng one mde, consequently
the communication more convenient than if it was nearer These
objections do not attach to John Langdon's island where most of the
s h p s of war have hitherto been built, which island I think contains
about 18 acres of ground, has about the same number of buildings
as are now erected in the present Navy Yard, & is within hail of the
town - But as the foregoing objections made by some to the present
site, are not, by others, considered of much welght, I am i n c h e d to
think, i t would be well to appoint three proper persons to examine &
report respecting the proper site.
With respect to the ~ u b l i cproperty in my care, it is in as good a
situation for seasoning & preservatron as I can think of - The
timber & plank are in the docks as before mentioned, & a shed built
over the plank, to prevent the sun from injuring those on the top,
which are not always under water - Some are of opinion that it
would be best to have the plank taken out of the dock, & put under
a shed on the land. Should this, or any other mode be thought
preferable to the one adopted, shall be happy to follow your directions
therein.
I expect to set out on a journey to Philadelphia, in a few days, &
shall probably arrive there about the time this reaches you, & expect
to remain at Philadelphia about a fortnight. I know of nothing in
particular that will call me to Washington, but if you should think
for me to come to Washington, & will write a line directed
54 South second street in Philadelphia I will come on [NDA. Misc. LB, 1802-3-4.1

no doubt will be lop'd off & will share the fate of their Parent root, if
one of the males escape it will occasion perpetual disturbance &

Hamed Bashaw, inform bun that the five fingers of the immortal
Allah! is directed against his brother & will never cease to persecute
him until the sin of fratercide is entirely wiped away from the Caraman1 family by the punishment of the Agressor, give him to understan that it was predestined by God & foretold in Tripoli by the
great heredita Maraboot (i e, Saint) Ciddi Mohammet Bogrltra that
he should be e deliverer of his Country, which was the real cause
that said Bogrha was murder'd by the reigning Bashaw, explain to
him the improbability of a nation so remote from Tripoli as America
is sending a Naval force to espouse his cause unless influenced by an
Omnipotent decree, no doubt by the intercession of the great Phrophet
(or Jupiter thunderer if you please) & if you have George Sales Koran,
a person who is so ood a theologist as you are, will be nt no greater

whom in my opinion they very justly des ised - As far back as the
2nq of July 1801 I wrote to Government re ative to engaging Mohamet
Bashaw in our interest or rather in his own, we theirfore have reason
to e ect instructions from government upon that head when the
Squa on arrives which we expect daily Should Ciddi Mohamet Bashaw be brought to Leghorn he shall be
treated with a great deal of attention, his suit it would be necesssary
to take good care of lest they should effect their escape, but the tenor
of Yours of the 2gt@seems to indicate that you have secured him by
inducing him to remain a t Tunis until the arrival of our Squadron,
which is a measure which will be attended with less trouble & expence
provided you are sure that he will not change his mind & that the
Bashaw of Tunis will not throw some impediment in the way of his
embarkation The President in his speech recommends coercive measures against
Tri oli, the popular opinion so far as i t is publickly declared, is
d o n s for defense but not one cent for tribute, if government places
a proper confidence in our communications ere long the peace of our
Country with the Barbmy States will be establish'd on a basis both
honorable & permanent, & then Lord let me die in peace for my eyes
have seen thy salvation to the total disappointment of the Sanhedrim
of Algiers.

Statement of Doctor Edward l i e r , concerning health of Captain Edward Preble,
0.8. Navy

Having been consulted nearly a year ago, in Captq Preble's case,
and having lately again attended him since his return to this City, I
am sorry to find that his disease continues with unabated severity,
and that, in Consequence of it, he is now reduc'd to a distressing state
of debility and Emaciation. The Duration and obstinacy of his
Illness forbid the Expectation that i t can be s eedily remov'd bv any
remedies hitherto attempted. Besides medic3 Treatment, his Situation requires Repose, tranquillity, uniformity of Temperature, and an
Incsssant, undivided Atten tion to all the means of recovery. Repeated
Experience proves that he is extremly susceptible of Injury from the
Cares & fatlgue of Business, and from Exposure to Cold, dampness,
and the usual Varieties of Weather. And as it is impossible that the
active and responsible Command he now holds can allow him the
Accommodations and Indulgencies indispensibiy requisite to the
restoration of his Health, I do not hesitate to advise him to retire, a t
least for the present, from the Service of the Navy.

attached to my Command has constantly preyed on my health, and
I have observed with concern its gradual decline ever since I first
came to this lace, Could I have gone to sea immediately after my
arrival here, fthink the cruise might possiblv have been of service to
me, but I am now so far reduced, as to be unable to attend to my duty,
and I think it improper any longer to hold the responsibility of m
Command, as I am confident the care and anxiet attached to it
Counteract the good effects of change of Air B
I have consulted Doctr Marshall, Surgeon of the Adams, and have also consulted
Doctr Miller a Gentleman of eminence in his Profession, and who has
been able to mark the progress of my disease, and I now enclose their
certificates for your information. I presume those certificates will
fully justify my re uesting your permission to resign the Command of
the A&ms, and as have no expectation that I shall for a long time to
come be able to attend to actual service, m d my holding my Commission may interfere with the present arrangments of the Navy Establishment and keep out some more deserving Officer, I request that I
may be permitted to resign it, At the same time, I beg leave to
assure you that I feel truly sensible of the honor confered on me by
the President of the United States in his having selected me as one of
the Nine Captains to be continued in the Navy, and also to assure
you that the situation of my h d t h alone induces me to resi

sairs being at Sea. - Ofl Cape Pallos spoke the wedish rigate
Thdie with a convoy Bound up the Mediterranean the Captain Informed me as soon as he got clear of the convoy (which would be in
two or three Days) he would proceed off Tripoli, agreeable to his
W e r s from his Admiral. - I found laying in the Bay of Gibraltar
Admiral Saumerez with four sail of the line & several Frigates, this
uadron was waiting there untill the Definitive Treaty was signed
so Lord Kieth with a fleet under his Command at Malta) there was
also a Portugeas Squadron consisting of one Sixty four, Three Frigates
& three Brigs - the Portugeas are at war with the Algerines, and it
ected will be with the Tunisians. - the Day that I arrived Cap$
Bain ridge, in the Essex returned from Tangier, Be went in serch of
a Pirate, that was said to be in the Straits, he was Informed at Tan 'er
that Sixteen or Twenty men in an open Boat had robbed a Swe 'sh
Vessel in the Bay of Tangier, he also heard of her in the Straits, but
saw nothing of her Admiral Saumerez informed me that he had
received infermation, from Cadiz of several Vessels being robbed
going through the Straits, also of a small Vessel, being found with
two, Men on Board Dead, & lashed to the Fore Mast, which was
sup osed to be done by some pirate, the Governor of Algeziras
app yed to him for a Frigate to convoy some small Vessels,
round to Cadiz, which he granted; the Day before I sailed M' Gavino
received infermation from Malaga that a Pirate had been in that Bay;
the Captain and two of the Men was taking up on shore the former
made his escape, the two men was put in Prison, the Captain is described and beleaved to be a French Man, It is extraordinary that
the Vessels is not described, I suppose that will be sent on b the
next post I shall not be surprised to hear of a number of Pirates eing
in the Mediterranean this summer
Admiral Saumerez received the same Infermation from the Governor of St Roque, He also Inform'd me that he had received letters

By Keeping A Number of Gun boats in the Straits, which there is no

Gun Boats had over any other kind of Corsairs in the Straits during
the late war, should he declair war against the US. I have no doubt,

been benefited by his instructions ere now, had he continued on board
the President On the morning of the Day on which the Boston was to sail, he went
on board with several of our Gentlemen - It appears soon after
they were on board Cap' MQNeilgave orders to unmoor - on hearing
this the Gentlemen who accompanied him on board, step'd into the
boat and solicited him to return with them but without effect, for
he told them Cap* MQN[eil]lwou'd send him on shore, which was not
the case as he was carried to sea, without Clothing and what I believe
he values much more his Books and apers -The Commodore seem'd
much displeased with Cap' M ~ N J the more I believe for leaving

number m d denomination of timber contained in the frame of a
Ship of 74 Guns - its dimensions & quantity in cubic feet - also a
return of the Timber inspected by M: Sam1 Humphreys. You will consider yourself hereby appointed inspector on the part
of the U. S - for the purpose of examinmg and deter[m]ining whether
the Timber contracted for with the Gentlemen above mentioned 1s
of the proper quality, cut conformably to the Moulds which the
have in their possession; delivered at proper landings, and in suc
qjlantities as will agree with the stipulations which they have respectavely entered into. Before you proceed to inspect the timber, you will provide ourself
with a book ruled in columns for each tier of timber, h e a d d a t top
with their respective names and under with larboard and starboard.
The columns should be large enough to admit of your marking how
much each timber is longer or shorter than its mould, to ascertain that
there is sufficient length in the whole timbers to complete each frame.
There should also be columns for the length, breadth, depth, and
contents in cubic feet of each piece of timber. - The Length to be
taken from the Moulds except otherwise ordered in the instructions
for procuring the Timber. Each account is to be headed with the
name of the place where each ship is to be built - say Portsmouth Boston - New York - Phila"
Washington, Norfolk - Each
piece of Timber is to be thus marked as well as with the name of the
timber both larboard & starboard. You will observe by the contracts & instructions, in what manner
the timber is to be got, and what latitude is given the procurers. I t
is essential that all outside pieces shall be of the best uality clear of
all defects whatsoever. Those for the frames genera y should also
be of sufficient quality, none that have large heart-shakes - large
splits, or are rotten in the least degree, should be received. You will
reject none improperly, nor will you receive any u d i t for the ship.
I t is expected that none will be delivered at a number of landing
places, and that there may be pieces for each ship delivered a t each
place, and it is essential to avoid mistakes in sending the pieces
mtended for one ship to a place where i t is intended another shall be
built, that the utmost care may be observed in making a t each place
distinct piles -so that each pile shall contain only the tlmber deslgned
for one Shi . I t is also essential that each plece of timber be so
conspicuous y marked in a way not to be rubbed out with the name
of the place to which it is to be sent - as to be at once distinguishable. Messr@William Smith & C-re

NAV:DEP:April 16. 1802 I have received your letter of the [13th] instant - tendering your
resignation. The circumstances under which you have made this tender, are of a
nature peculiar1 affecting to me, and irresistably excite sensations
of sympathy an regret, as well for the calamities with which you are
afEicted, as for the loss the Country will sustain in being deprived of
the services of a Gentleman possessing such high qualifications to
advance and maintain its naval character. I cannot however but
hope that the cause of this deprivation will soon be removed. To
accept your resignation under such circumstances and under no other,
would you, I am persuaded, have a t this season offered it, would be
an act of the highest injustice to you. To insist on your c o n t i n e g
in the command of the Adurns would be an act of inhumanity, wluch
no State necessity scarcely, could justify. You will therefore hereby
consider yourself released from the command of the Adams and on
furlough until your Health shall be restored, and I pray you to accept
my sincere wishes for its speedy restoration. [NDA. OSW, LB, Vol. 5,1801-1802.1

that a Vessel under full Sail would go through 18 Inches of it without
the least hindrance After you get over the Flatts you have five fathom

et an unexpended balance in the Treasury of $9,265.18 which cannot

SIR. In a letter with which Capt: Sterrett was lately charged for
you, and of which a duplicate has been since forwarded, it was intimated, that your services might be called for, and that it would be
adviseable for you to be prepared to embark at a short notice. I
hope that this Letter will have reached you, and have had it's effect.
The disposition to peace expressed by the Bashaw of Tripoli, on the
appearance of comodore Dale before that lace, with the impression
which it is hoped has been made on him y the course and cucurnstances of the war, have lead the President to conclude, that the time
is come when negotiations may advantageously take place. In
order to make them the more &cacious, I t is intended that the whole
of our naval force destined for the Mideterranem under the command of Capt. Morris, should rendevous before Tripoli, and the Adams
frigate, being the last that is to sale for that purpose, Capt. Campbell,
will be the bearer of this dispatch.
The President confiding in our ca acity, experience and faithful
regard to the interests of the h t e d !$)tabs,has thought proper that
you should accompany this expedition, and be charged with the
negociation, which is to be combined with it. You are accordingly
instructed, to embark, and attend, under such arrangements as.(?apt :
Morris shall provide, and to proceed as circumstances may mvlte,
to the execution of the trust. As it is evidently desireable, that the
h t overtures should come from the Bashaw, you will wait a reasonable time for the effect of his disposition on this subject, or of the
awe inspired by a display of our foroe before his eyes and his capiW.
Should no advances be made on his part, you may open a communi-

cation by referring to the wish heretofore expressed by the Bashaw,
that an accomodation of differences might be brought about; and by
observing that the President, on being informed of it, bad instructed
you to let him know, that notwithstanding the causeless and provoking declaration of War, and the force which is reprtred and preparing b the United States, ta carry it on with f
effect, yet from
a love oTpeace in the United States, they are willing to receive him
into their friendship on the proper terms, which he may be told will
include some i n d e d c a t i o n for the expence which he b s occasioned
to the United Shtes. This is a condition however, which if not likely
to be 'elded, need not be pressed farther than will shew the high
groun taken in the negociafion, and than will consist with (I digdied
relearn of the demand; but you are in the most perempto manner,
to stifle every pretension or expectation, that the Unitad b t e s will
on their side, make the smallest contribution to him as the price of
[Fe.
To buy peace of Tripoli, is to bid for W r with Tun&, which
avmg now received all the tributes due to her, would immediately
look to war, as the expedient for renewing them.
In case a satisfactory disposition for peace should be manifested, you
may proceed to arrange a Treaty, subject
the approbation of the
President, and to the constituhonal sanction. The Treaty of the
4*hof November 1796, of which a copy is herewith sent, and may also
be found in the laws of the United States, vol: 4. Page 44, may be
taken for the basis and the body of it. You will o m t however, so
much of the first article as makes Algiers the guaranty, and of the last,
as makes the Dey, the arbiter and expositor of the Treaty; i t being
understood, that a stipdation of this sort, gives to that Regency, an
ernb~nassingconnection with our affairs a t Tripoli, and by wounding
the pride of the Bashaw of the latter, adds the force of another passion
to that of his cupidity, in slighting his engagements. At the same
time, umbrage to &em ought to be avoided, by letting this change
in the treaty with Tripoli, be the Act of the Bashaw rafhar than of the
United States, and be made so to appear to the De
No other parts
of the Treaty seem to be objectionable, but if there any other which
has been found inconvenient, you are s t liberty to omit it. Bs your
residence and e rience, may have suggested also regulations which
did not occur w en the late Treaty was formed, but which m y be
useful in preventing im ositions or diipuhs, the defech may be s u p
plied. I t seems partic arly proper, that, the forceable use of h e n c a n
vessels by the Basihaw or his subjects, and liability .of the United Sfates
for the property of Tripoli taken out of Ammean vessels by the
enemies of Tripoli, should be guarded against.
The good disposition which Sweden bas & e m , to unite her measures
with those of the United States, for controuhg the predatory habits
of the Barbary Powers,rtnd particularly for bringbg Tripoli to proper
terms of Peace, requires, that in th? negociations for the latter purpose,
there should be some understanding with her officers and agents, if
they are so disposed, and that the negociations should even go on
hsnd in h d , if their objects and arrangements be favorable to the
plan, keeping however, the Treaties.which may result, as absolutdy
uncomected ~ n independent,
d
both m the view of th? Bashaw and of
Sweden, as if formed without the least understandmg between the
United S t s h and Sweden. A joint appeal to the fears and interest
of the B d a w , by extinguishing the hope of dividing his enemies, will

drive him to better terms with both. In any course of things, it is
desireable that youshould avoid the appearance of turning the War of
Sweden to any unfair advantage of the United States, in making peace
for themselves; a pogcy of su* evil tendency in every respect, that
nothing could advlse it but a bcovery that Sweden was playing such
a ameagsinst us.
is expected by the President, that you will cultivate the best
understanding with Capt. Morris, the commander of the squadron;
and that you will communicate with him with confidence and frankness, in the conduct of your negotiations.
Should peace be established, you will make with the Bashaw, the
arrangements for his receiving an American Consul, as soon as one
shall be provided. But you will have it understood, that as the
Consulate was interrupted so unjustifiably by himself, the re-establishment of it will give no title, even in point of usage, to presents of
any sort. Should it be deemed expedient to send any little gratification along with the consul, it will in that case have the advantage
of G i g unexpected by the Bashaw, and the merit of proceedin from
generosity and good will. Until a consul shall be provide%, you
cannot do better than engage a continuance of the good offices of
Mc Nissen, if he retains the confidence hitherto put in him. The
President is sensible of his past services to this country, and wishing
him to have some recornpence for them, will be glad of any explanations you can give, as to the form and amount of a proper one. It
will be best that no particular expectation on this head, should be
raised in Mr Nissen; but you may let him know generally, that his
friend1 care of the affairs of the United States has attracted the
f avoratle at tention of the President.
The commission herewith transmitted, will inform you, that the
future destination given you, is to the consulate at Algiers, which will
be opened for you by the resignation of Mz obrien, and the permission
given him to retire on your arrival. (Inasmuch as the Dey of Algiers
refused to accept Mr Cathcart, he was not recognized as U. S. Consul,
Algiers, although appointed.] The President havin thought proper
to discontinue the su erintendance of that Consu ate over others,
your duties will be re uced accordingly, and therewith the salary to
the standard of Two thousand Dollars per annum. It being the wish
of the President to discourage on all occasions the venal and expensive
customs with which Barbary now taxes the intercourse with civilized nations, it will be an agreeable circumstance if you can make yourself the
successor of Mr obnen without the presents exacted from New Consuls.
The attempt however must not risk the good understanding wit-hthat
Regency, and if you deem the chance of euccees so slender, as to
require that you should go prepared to meet the demand, it may be
most convenient for you to return from Tripoli to Leghorn, ,in order
to rovide the articles to be presented. For this p
se, it a meant
to od e a fund there in due time. Wee the Dey
to accept in
cash t e value of the customary presenb, the change would coincide
with the general wish to simplify all our engagemen& in Barbary into
a pecuniary form.

A t 1 PM came round to Se & Ee same time the Portuguss Frigate
attempting to get one of his Anchors up got foul of us, the third .time

Anchor, the Portuguese got clear. At 3 past 3 the Portuguese Commodores boats (in weighing the frigates anchor that had cut her cable)
weighed our anchor which caused our ship to drive into 51 fath. water,
I ordered them immediately to let go their purchase as their anchor
was foul of ours, consequently our ship woud drive off the b a d as she
was then very near the edge & aIso forbade them to weigh thew
anchor, untill we weighed ours which I intended to do a t 7 OClock.

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1802 TO 1803
To Captain Richard V. Morria, U. 8. Navy, from Secretary of the Navy

NAV:DEP: Ap: 20: 1802.Thc President conceiving that the period has arrived when newciations for pea.ce with the Bashaw of Tripoli may be opened under
circumstances which promise an advantageous issue, ,Mr Cathcart,
now at Leghorn, has been clothed with official authority to execute
that trust. In pursuing his instructions and exercising his authority
on this oint, he will communicate with ou confidencially and unreserved y, and it is expected that you
cultivate the best understanding with him, and communicate frequently & fully, and cheerfully
cooperate with him in all points relating to his mission. I t has beeen determined to lay all our Naval force under your
Command before Tripoli, and Mr Cathcart will accompany the expedition. Holding out the olive Branch in one hand & displaying in
the other the means of offensive operations, may produce a. peaceful
disposition towards us in the mind of the Bashaw, and essentially contribute to our obtaining an advantageous treaty with him. You will,
therefore, irnmediataly upon receiving this, dispatch a vessel to
Leghorn to M' Cathcart (the Enterprize I should suppose would
answer) with instructions to proceed thence to such place as you
may appoint for a general Rendezvous, prior to laying before Tripoli.
Mr Cathcart having joined you a t such place of Rendezvous, ou will
proceed with the whole squadron under your command andlay off
against Tripoli taking every care to make the handsomest and most
military display of your force and so conducting your manourres as to
excite an impression that in the event of negociations fahng, you
intend a close and vigorous blockade. Although I have directed you to lay your whole force before
Tripoli, you will yet consider yourself authorized should you deem i t
necessary, to leave one Vessel to watch the movements of the Emperor
of Morocco, and to prevent the escape of the Tripolitan Vessel at
Gibraltar. On this subject you are required to exercise your soundest
discretion, bearing in mind that although we wish our whole force to
be displayed before Tripoli, yet we cannot think of abandonning our
Commercial Vessels & Seamen to the Emperor, should his disposition
be hostile towards us, or of suffering the Tripolitan Vessel a t Gibraltar
to escape. I t has not been deemed expedient to associate the Commanding
OfEcer of the Squadron with M' Cathcart in the Commission to
make peace.

To Eon. William Ellery, United States Senate, from Secretary of the Bavy

NAV:DEP: $2 Ap. 1802. The Bill, making an appropriation for the support of the Navy for
the year 1802, having been referred to a Comrmttee of which you are
the Chairman, I consider it my duty to state to you that some of the
appropriations therein .proposed are not sufficient. The sum of
$94,341.92 has been paid and expended since the 1 of January last
for the repairs of public Vessels in actual service, & therefore such
sum a t least ought to be added to the proposed appropriation of
$50,000. Fifty thousand dollars ought to be added to the a propriation for repairs of Vessels in ordinary, and $50,000 ought a so to be
added to the appropriation for the Navy Yards. The cost of the
Timber of the U. S. - deposited and to be deposited in the several
Navy Yards amounts to the sum of $580,000. - To provide adequate
means for the water & dry seasoning of such valuable property is
obviously an object of great national importance. Large Ware
Bouses are also indispensably necessary for the securing of the costly
stores of the Department, and for preservation of the sails, Cables,
and other furniture of the public Ships. These, combin'd with other
considerations, will, I trust, suggest the expediency of appropriating
a t least $150,000 to the improvements of the Navy Yards. The enclosed classification of the appropriations I would prefer.
The one proposed in the Bill would give great and unnecessary trouble
in drawing warrants and in keeping the accounts as well in the Treasury as in this department. Beretofore these specific appropriations
have been disregarded in the drawing of warrants. -

SIRThis is the first opportunity I have had to write since my depar-

ture from America, from whence we set out with favourable prospects,
and accomplished more than two thirds of our passage in twelve days,
when near the Western Islands, we met with head Easter1 winds,
which hung upon us for four weeks incessantly, and at times b ew very
heavy, a t other times, ve light, & baWing, so that our progress was
slow indeed, notwithstan ing our utmost exertions to get on in due
time, but in the several gales of wind we had, I found our ship proved
to be perfect in a11 things, & the alterations we have made in her, we
vastly to her advantage, in stiffness, sailing, & for c a q k g her
stores We have had six weeks passage, & intended to have called a t
Gibralter but when off that place, the W i d blew so heavy from the
Westward & consequently, a wild roadsbed, that I was fearfull to trust
my ship there with a single Anchor, & was the more perswaided as to
the inexpediency of stopin there, having fallen in with Sir James
Soumarez, in Cemer of 80 uns, who informed me that he had just
come off from Gibralter, & that no part of our S uadron la7 there, I
therefore thought i t best to run here, and to sen infornabon to our
Consul there, M: Gavino to inform him of our Arrival in these Seas, &
that I should proceed to Carthagen%,to endeavour to procure Anchors,

SIR I fondly hoped to see you yesterday when attempting to beat

lost two in the Delaware Bay as we came down, I should have been

who informed me that there were no American Men of War in the

i t best to stand on for Malaga for information & from hence shall
proceed on to Carthagena to try to procure Anchors & a Cable, If
I do not succeed there I shall then go on to Toulon & from thence off

them of my being on these seas, to most of whom I send you Letters

NAV:DEP. - 9, May, 1802
I have red your letter of the 28 ultimo. The period you have thought fit to select for tendering your resignation is unfortunate for the Government, and not very honorable
to yourself. The reasons you alledge as governing your determination transpired years ago: if you thought them of such consequence
as to oblige your resignation, you ought to have resigned at the time
they occurred. I know what the feelings of military Men are, and
that among them there always exista a jealousy on the subject of
rank: this jealousy is by no means an improper one, but it sometimes
leads men into hasty & intemperate decisions, incompatible with
their own honor. I should not have ordered you to join the Adam but from absolute
necessity. We had no other Officer in the country in whose ca acity,
as I could so confidently rely sa in your's. The situation of & P h n

142

Preble's health required that one of the ablest Lieutenants in the

you would never again be sent out in a station eferior to the command
of a frigate, I wished you to see as much servlce as possible, and not
intending to send the Constitution out, there was no other Vessel to
which you could have been ordered except the Adams. These, Sir, are the considerations which induced my order to you
to join that Frigate; rand yet a t the very time when the ship is about
to sail, you exhibit a statement of old grievances which you say
compel you to tender your resignation. If upon receipt of this letter, you continue in the disposition expressed in your's of the 28 ultimo, you will communicate your determination to Capt. Campbell and consider this as an acceptance of
your resignation; othemlse you will remain on board the Adam. [NDA. OSW, LB, Vol. 5, 1801-1802.1

SIR, Day before yesterday it was announced to the Bey that an
American frigate had captured four Coasting Vessels belonging to his
Subjects, bound to Tri oli, laden with wheat, barley, oil and other
provisions - I was ca ed to the Palace - Immediate restitution of
Vessels and cargoes were demanded by the Bey - Yesterday a n d
today have been consumed in discussion on the subject - detail of
which would be too tedious - The Bey assert.ed a right to carry
provisions in all eases to his brethren - I denied its application to
U States, by saying, that if this principle were established between
him and his brethren, i t did not extend to those who were not included
in that relation. He quoted the Venitiene in the war with him - I

fi

143

WARS U'ITH BARBARY POWERS

told him we did not admit them as authority, and quoted examples of
the English and French - He asserted the principle of free bottoms
free goods - I answered that this principle was never construed to
extend to a blockaded port. He referred to the President's Letter to
him of gt? Sep. last, and inferred from i t an implied order to respect
his flag, Vessels and Subjects in all Situations - I did not suppose
this construction would bear, and that a fair construction could only
imply that respect so long as he or his Subjects respected the laws of
neutrality - I had given seasonable and formal advise of the
blockade of Tripoli: if, after this, he permitted bis subjects to carry
provisions to that port i t was taking the responsibility on himself ~f they took these enterprizes without his consent, i t was a voluntary
risque on their part and they had no reason to complain in case of
capture - But the captures being made agreeably to acknowledged
msxuns of war were of course good prize to the Captors, and were undoubtedly before this moment, dlsposed of as such, reclamations
therefore on the Commandant would avail nothing - The Bey
talked of reprisals. I told him, in such case I should know what steps
to take. If he chose to embroil himself with U S it would become our
duty, however reluctantly, to meet his hostility by retaliation - He
said he would transfer his claims to the American Government. I
assured him they would there meet a righteous discussion - He
desired me to write to the Commodore to capture no more of his
Vessels, but turn them away in case he found them bound to Tripoli I told him our Commanding Officers were Subordinate to no ordem
but those of the President of the United States; my advise therefore
would be disrespected except exactlv conformable to those orders Such are the cut lines of our discussion; and thus me stand here.
I am convinced this Regency dare not attempt a System of reprisals; but am of o inion that Indemnity will be hereafter reclaimed.
The captures, I be 'eve, have been made by CnpNpNeill. He is
doing his duty - Whaterer restitution may be m future conceded,
this is not the moment to yield in the smallest matter that will go to
deminish that opinion of our energy with which these pirates begm to
be impressed - It will be Sessonrtblo enough to be generous when
they shall be taught faappreciate duly our generosity - I left the
Bey in apparent good humor - Our AUy thesweede; hasalso Ca tured
one of the Bey's merchantmen; but he says he knows perfec y well
how to manage the Sweedes. I have heard nothing from the Bashaw
of Tripoli's brother since he sailed, as we suppose for Malta, on the

need not repeat, that it will be an agreeable
circumstance, if your admission can be effected without it; or with
as small a ortion of it as ossible; or that if a present be unavoidable,
it will be ess disagreeab e in the simple form of cash, than in the

The accounts which we continue to receive strengthen our expectation, that you will find the Bashaw of Tripoli in a proper disposition
to peace, and be able to conclude it on terms admisable by tihe United
States, However able this country may be to carry on the war with
effect, the expence aad trouble of it, and the encressed risk whilst at

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1802 TO 1809

Extract from letter to James Leander Cathcart, U. S. ex-Consul, Tripoli, from
Nicholas C. Nissen, Danish Consul, Tripoli

TRIPOLI10 May 1802
Dr SIR I had the honor on the 22c & 30t@ulto to inform you of the
situation of affairs a t Tripoli relative to the Swedish negotiation, the
result however has not been propitious, for the Bashaw persisted in
having Col. Tornquist's Agreemt ratified, which was refused by the
Adm! and war was declared formall by the Bashaw against Swedn
on the 5'9 ins(byhis ordering the ~ w e & hflag staff to be taken down. On the evenmg of the 1gt inst the Consuls were summoned to the
castle, where the Bashaw in the presence of the two Swedish officers
stated the treatment he had received from Sweden since the conclusion of Tornquist's treaty & compared his treatment to them since
that period, & ended his observations by asking if he had not sufficient
reason to declare war against that nation, & then solemn1 declared
that he never intended to enter into another treaty wit Sweden.
War was to be declared the next day nevertheless i t was postponed
to the st@in hopes that by continuing the negotiation, an accomodation would take place, but the AdmJ would not listen to any terms
but those he proposed which were as follows "The Swedish prisoners
to be liberatd without ransom; Peace to be established without paying
any consideration whatever for i t as presents or otherwise, upon the
same terms as i t was before the declaration of mar in 1800." The
Admiral alledged that the Bashaw having captured Swedish property
to a considerable am+ could not possibly have any claim against
Sweden. The Swedish Admiral who never trusted himself on shore
here, is cruizing off this port in a schooner said to be American.
I think it my duty as your friend as well as in consequence of my
having encharged myself with the affairs of the United States in your
absence & even as Danish Consul to make the following confidential
communications, which I beseech you for your own advantage to
pa attention to; but to keep secret. $his Regency is at war with the U. S. 61 Sweden and you know Sir
that our frigates are to come here this Summer. I cannot inform you
a t this moment the particular intentions of Govt, any farther than to
assure you that his Danish Majesty will by no means comply with
the Bashaws extravagant demands, even if War should be the immediate consequence.
I hope Sir that you are sufficiently acquainted with me to believe
that no personal consideration will ever deter me from d o i .
myI
dut as Danish Consul or from fulfilling my promise to you w en
too upon me the guidance of your affairs dunng our absence "The
Swedes have declared here that they were close y allied with the
U. S. of America & that said States could not enter into a Negotiation
or conclude a peace with this Regency without consulting th?m! I
do not beleive it, for similar agreements must of course be rec~procal
& I have already informed you that the Swedish Admiral endeavoured
to conclude a seperate peace, which would have been the case had his
terms been acceded to and the french republic is a parently the
Mediator between Sweden & this Regency. I know t e Bashaw of
Tripoli has made an effort to conclude a treaty with the U. S. of
America through the mediation of A Z q k 3 , & I a m very much mistaken if there are not a t this moment other plans under consideration,

as several of the Bashaw's adherenfs endeavour to gain his confidence
by suggesting them; they endeavour most strenuously to keep them
secret from me, they do me the justice to believe that I will never
admit an thing that I believe to be contrary to the interests of the
u. s. & or the same reasons, the Bashaw wishes some other person
to be encharged with American affairs when a Negotiation takplace more congenial to his interest Dear Sir I have only one advice
to give, that is, that the U. S. of America postpone any Negotiation
with this Regency till you are off Tripoli yourself on board an American ship of war, I do not know how far I shall be able to act as I
could msh, during your absence, as i t amounts to a certainty that I
shall be prevented from corresponding with the Comodore of the
S uadron & every means to prevent my interposition will be acceptab e to the Bashaw & his adherla but when ou are present yourself
they know you too well to suppose you woul not act for the interest
of your natlon without being in necessity of my advice & then I shall
be entirely a t liberty to act as circumstances require. Your conduct
& exertion in the execution of your duty is admired & it certainly
merits all the applause that can be given, & only you Sir will be able
to conclude a treaty of peace with this regency on terms that will
insure to your nation the advantages which you have created. I
wish very much to see you here again for my own sake to have a
friend & a sensible interesting Society. a t present my situation is in
every respect disagreeable, Mr Antoine Zuchet the Batavian charge

Eaton, U. 8. Consul, Tunis

COPY
T U N Il g~t QMay 1802.
SIR, I t is with extreme concern that I find myself compelled to
present to you a remonstrance against the unmilitary conduct of
some one of the Gentlemen Commanding under you in the Squadron
of the United States in this Sea - The document herewith Inclosed
exhibits a Scene of debasement as dishonorable to our Arms as i t
is detrimental to our true interests - It cannot be su posed an
object with our Government to carry on a predatory war ere, even
against our enemies, much less against our friends; or, if that were
an object, that it should be degraded so far below any thing which
has hitherto marked our national character as to descend to individual
plunder and stripping. I t is a singular instance in our history; and
not less singular that a Gentlemaa in Commission should accede to
a compromise for his reputation on such dangerous considerations.
We ought, above all things, to endeavour to impress here a sense of
our justice and magnanimity, as well as power: small spoliations,
like this in view, go neither to establish the one nor the other Thou h the evidence on which is founded my belief of the facts here
comp ained of be exparte, yet it is accompanied with circumstances
which will not admit a doubt of their veracity Had the Xebeck in question been Captured and sent in for adjudication, even in that case, no argument could justify lundering her
until after condemnation, nor then in the Shamef manner here
presented - But conduct so extreme1 reprehensible ought to recieve
a t least a check; the manner in whic this should be effected comes
more pro erly within your Sphere - I t would be desirable to spare
the Sac ' ce of individual character in this case if it can be done m d
the mischief remidied - The affair has occasioned me serious
pe lexity here; it went very nearly to have produced a rupture
wit this Regency - I have followed the maxims of justice and honor
in my arrangements to accommodate it: but the ammount of the
payments should be reclaimed of those who committed the Violence.
I rely on the Solicitude this event must excite in your breast, for the
honor of our flag, to cause an investigation of the facts, for bringing
the aggressor to a suitable observance of a more manly conduct,
and for reventing a re etition of enterprizes so disgraceful - 81though could neither earn the name of the Schooner nor of her
Commander from the part agreeved, there can be no great difficulty
in ascertaining facts, as [sup ose there is but one Vessel of t h ~ s
Species under your immediate ommand.
P. S. May 21. I t is with infinite satisfaction that I fhd the violence
complained of in the document herewith is confined to three privates
of Lieu$ Sterret's schooner, without an officer being implicated. It
is also satisfactory to have ascertainezthat the captures for which
this Bey demands indemnity have all been made by the swedes The arguments! however, which have naturally arisen on the subject
of the reclamahon will have a ood effect, as they teach the Bey what
he must expect in case of slrmkar captures by the Americans
Lieu$ Sterret arrived here day before yesterday, thirty six hours
from before Tripoli - He info= that the Swedish flag staff has, at
length been formally cut away - and that there had been some

DEARSIR Having this moment arrived here from Algiers, which
place I left yesterday, I think it of vast importance to give you the
lnclosed information, from M' OBrian, who came off to me whlle I lay

off the Town, you will of Course make the same known if the information hath not et transpired. - Why will the narrow & seEsh policy
of European ations suffer those Piratical powers thus to usurp the
dominion of this Sea? Ought they not rather to be put under the
Ban of all civilization? Was there a chance of making war with them,
upon such terms as not to effect the liberty of those, who fall into their
hands, & to exchange man for man, some excuse might be alledged,
but on the present form of warfare, all nations ought to cry aloud
against them, I have no doubt but before the Portugeese at Gibralter
can gain this intelhgence, but they will be out with this additional
force, as neither frigate sustained any damage, & they will be inspired

May $5,1802.
SIR, Yesterday I received a note from the Bey's pnme minister
the Schooner this
demand' an interview with myself and Cap-f
morning3ut the Schooner had alwady departed - I rendered
myself a t the palace to encounter as 1 supposed, new perplexities;
but on passing the usual ceremony with the Bey I discovered on his
countenance an usual air of cornp\aisance - He signified to me that
after waiting a little 1 should be informed of the object of calling me
to the palace - Accordingly in about an hour after, I accompanied
the minister with the commercial Agent of the Regency into a private
chamber; where, after a great deal of circumlocution, he came to
the object in view; which was nothing more nor less than a proposibion
of peace on the part of the Ba8haw of Tripoli through the m e d i a t h and
under the guu~anteeof $ 7 Bey
~ of Tuni8.

At evening the Commercial Agent was at my house - went over
the same ground. Was sure that we should never have a peace without paying ~omelhing'- it would disgrace the Regency: but he
seemed extremely solicitous to have permission to write something
promising to Tripoli on the Subject of a negotiation - He said, what
the minister had asserted in the morning, that the o d y pretext the
Bashaw of Tripoli had for breaking faith with U. S. was, that the
peace was not voluntary on his part; but forced on him by Algiers.
These overtures go to prove the embarrassed situation of our
enemy; and promise, if suitable advantage is taken of it, a peace
on our own terms. We hold the high grounds of him at all points I am partial to my original plan of restoring the rightful Bashaw,
though nothing was said on the subject at the palace to day. I think
it highly probable that the rei&g Bashaw has offered more powerful
ar~umenfsto engage this &star
in his interest than either his
brother had the means or myself the discretion of offering. Besides,
the Bey of Tunis is ignorant of that project. It will be Seasonable
enough to inform him of it after having insured ita success - In
the mean time let us amuse the usurper with his own propositions

appeared for the dispatch of the Phil*, I took upon myself the previledge of a Senior Officer, to grant his request, especially, as it appeared
to me needless, his longer detention on the station, presuming that i t
was your desire that the Ships shoud be releived as others arrived, &
that we shoud soon have a reinforcement sufficient for all purposes Two of the Barbary States are upon the most friendly terms with
us, & Tripoli, ready, & willing to come into any conditions; with
those Ideas, which I have since found so well founded, I flatter myself
I shell not be accused of usurping an undue authority, as that Ship,
especially, was a t a very heavy expence to the Government I took on board at Gibralter, the valuable present of Arms for the
Bey of Tunis, sent there by Mr King from London, on my way up,
I called in a t Algiers & had a short interview with Mr OBrien, rP:
learnt from him, that our affairs were all in order, there, Owin to head winds I was ten Days on my assago to this place,
when I anded the present, which was highly p easing to the Bey &
as he expressed himself, truly worthy the reception of a Prince, (&
indeed nothing could be more Magnificent or costly of the kind,) one
of the muskets alone cost near £900 sterling These presents have an excellent effect, as hlr Eaton will inform
you, for the Bey seems well dis osed to shew us the utmost civility, but
it is not amiss to shew those olks our Ships, now, & then, they are
powerful advocates in our favor The Enter ria is now here, & shall instruct Lieu! Sterret, to take
a valuable merican Merchantman from hence, under his Convoy,
bound to Barcelona & shoud he find other American Vessels there,
bound out the Streights, he will be instructed to take them under

SIR AS the Ship Morning Star is now ready to sail, I wish you to
take her under your Convoy as far as Barcelona, & when you arrive
there, if you find other American Vessels ready to sail, & the reports
respecting the Pirates on the Coast of Spain, yet bears any authenticity ~ o must
u
proceed on with them as far as GibraIter - you will
avad yourself of every information on that head & from the American Consul a t Barcelona, & shoud it be d e e d necessary for proceeding further on, you will act accordingly & return to your station of[fl
Tripoli without delay, by which time we shall certainly have our
Frigate out from America, when i t may be necessav to make new
arrangements, & I think it will be best to defer doing any thing to
your Copper till then,
If you go no farther than Barcelona, it will not be amiss for you to
call m at Naples, through the Streights of Bonifacio, to put any
Americans that may be there on their guard, & recommend them to
take that route in preference to going round Sardenia, where the Tripolines Cruize, that is, off, & about the South end thereof, - you will
endeavour to spread the information we have received respecting those
Cruizers being out, & hope no misfortunes may attend it [NDA. A. Murray's LB, 1794-1805.1

"It did appear he had been instructed to treat with us upon the

Shaw in every thing whilst they were together. The Frigate was
under the necessity of putting into Malaga for water. If the Peace

Consul, Tunis

TUNIS,June 6th, 1802.
ON the 28th ult. arrived the United States frigate ConsteUation,
Capt. Alexander Murray, last from Gibraltar. He delivered me the
arms prepared in London for this Bey, which I have presented, saving
the sword, and which were highly acceptable; but, in the uniform
spirit of insolence which Christians tolerate in these Regencies, the
Bey, through his Minister, after receiving these valuable articles,
revived a former demand for a corvette or brig of war, such as we had
given Algiers. I referred him to treaty stipulations; and thus silenced
this claim, a t least for the present: it wiU be revived the instant that
we consent to pay Tripoli for a peace; which must be the result of
that war unless more energy be thrown into our operations.

TUNIS8, June 1802
SIR, My measures with Mahamet Bashaw the rightful sovere'
of Tripoli, which I have had the honor to detail to
different routs and various occasions, have undergone very severe
criticism by Captains S. Barron and Bainbridge; by them reprobated
in a stile of most illiberal censure; and under their influence; rejected
by Cap? Murray in an air of authority and reprimand which I should
not expect from the highest departments of government.
I am aware that the e ression found in my communication on the
subject, We are abandone by our ahips of war, may have touched the
feelings of Gentlemen commanding them - I am not in fault for that.
It is m duty, at least I consider it so, to report facts as they present
themse ves to me: no consideration will divert me from that duty.
The Philadelphia sailed from this port the 23g September last for
Tripoli; and returned 24 Oct. follow-mg, she has not been seen here
since; and one of her midshipmen now acting in the ConsteUation,
whose name I forget, a.fErms that she has but once since shewn herself
before Tripoli, and then remained on the station only six hours - thie
is the only U States ship of war (Except the (feo. W d n g t o n , a trans-

port.) which has appeared a t d on this coast since October until the
arrival of the Bostm, Ca MqNiell, who has ke t his ost. The
extremity of winter compeU the Commander of the P iladelp ia to take
home and lodgings a t Saragosa, except thirty or forty days he has
been on shore a t Leghorn - The Essex has been stationed off
Gibraltar to watch the hull of a dismantled ship: but that post she has
left occasionally ten, twelve or fifteen days a t different periods: she
may have had special calls a t Malaga and Cadiz. This is a singularly
economical mode of carrying on the war; and it is not extraordinary,
if Gentlemen feelingly attached to i t should take offence a t a vigilance
which should go to put an end to it.
There may be another source of grievance between one of those
entlemen and myself, which takes its rise a t Algiers: I have used the
Eberty, in terms as pointed as every citizen of the United States should
feel the abasement, to express my concern that a United States ship of
war [Qeorge Washington] should have been exposed to the ridicule of
nations navigating the sea under Algerine Colors; And, though I never
aimed to reflect any censure on the commander, who acted under
perhaps inevitable compulsion yet i t is nevertheless possible, nay
probable that the turn M? OBrien may have given to my expressions
should have wounded his sensibility: * * *
Last summer, when I used the discretion to declare Tripoli in a
state of Blockade; to which measure Commro Dale gives his concurrence and assurance of support by his letter of 28. August; had circumstances favored a close blockade a few weeks only, we might have
had peace on our own terms. The project which forms matter for
this communication presented another position still more favourable,
because it promised a permanent peace. Every thing relatin to the
project, so far as de ended on my exertions, has had its fui? effect.
The Bashaw faithfu to his engagements went to Malta; and was
there 17q May - had an interview with Captain McNiell - and
promised to wait there the arrival of Commodore Truxton's squadron:
I believe he is still there. If Commr' Dale's squadron had continued
on its post till relieved, as appenrs to have been intended, and had
seized the occasion which my project with the Bashaw offered; the
U States ere this, perhaps, might have had a peace on terms equally
honorable and advantageous - I hope the opportunity is not lost.
But I am extremely hurt a t the precipitate manner in which Ca .
Murray thinks himself authorized to discard the project; and equal y
so a t the public censure he has allowed himself the freedom to pass
on my conduct in the affair, a t Gibraltar. Had he possessed the
delicacy due from one officer of the government to another, and sent
my ship back to me with his opinion modestly expressed, I should
have been reconciled to the manner, though not to the measure of
his conduct; but to proclaim in the Consulate of the U States, a t
that place, my reprehensibility - to forbid the Consul furnishing the
ship any Supplies - and to endeavor to take the seamen out of her
as he really did two of them in his own barge (as if prepensel bent to
distress ma) are transactions a t which a man of less sensib&ty than
myself could not but be moved - It is an ezpatfe way of examining - and a summary way of blasting men and measures, which would
better become an eastern Bashaw than a citizen of the United States
in commancl but all this out of pure regard to the Treasury! He

2'

g

f

168

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1802 TO 1809

might have had the discernment to perceive that hitherto no expense
had accrued to the U States, that this is an account which remams to
be audited a t the proper office; and, under these reflections, with an
equal zeal to the interest of our common country, he might have
spared the sensibility of a public servant, who, if not as old in service
as himself, thinks i t no arrogance to assert as ardent a concern for the
public welfare. I t is remarkable, and savors somewhat of duplicity,
that while here six days, and conversing with the utmost seeming
frankness and friendship, Captain Murray never once signified to me
the steps he had taken with the Gloria - He only said he had given
Capn Bounds a letter and copies of his instructions from government
to bring me. He certainly did not concur, a t first, in opinion with
me on the project in view - and advanced for reason, that no construction of his orders would justify him in taking the said Bashaw
out of a neutral vessel, though in character of an enemy with forty
armed soldiers of Tripoli for his guard; nor even to fire a shott on a
Tripoline town or castle in support of any measures whatsover - his
operations being direct,ed solely against the cruisers a t Sea. I disputed this construction with him on the principles of the laws of
nations and maxims of war; and, I believe, convinced him of an error But if his construction were correct, according to the object and
intent of government, how could it prohibit his co-operstions with a
rightful Bashaw to seduce a rebel and a common enemy, and bring
about an event which promises a vast saving and perpetual peace to
the U States? I do believe, however premature, chimerical, or msane
the project may appear on a superficial view, or seen through a partial
medium, if supported, i t would have saved the United States more
than a million of dollars and many lives - And, I do believe, it
might have taken effect if the coast of Barbarbary had presented as
powerful attraction as that of Europe. It is a project which has long
been in concert between the rightful Bashaw and myself: it was suggested to me by Mr Cathcart; I have acted with the advice and concurrence of M' Cathcart; Cap. MqNiell: Doc! Wm Turner of the
navy; M! Chas Wadsworth of the navy; Caps! Geo. G: Coffin and
Jos. Bounds, american masters of .merchantmen; (the last named four
gentlemen in this house when I dispatched the Gloria on this service)
the Swedish charge of affairs; and Mr Lewis Hargreaves, an English
gentlemen in my confidence, appointed to take charge of this office
m case of my decease or necessaw absence - If then the commanders of the Philadelphia and hssex are correct in ch~rgingme
with insanity, those gentlemen must have labored under the same
delirium. But, Imowmg the relative situation of the two Bashaws;
the universal discontent of the subjects of Tripoli with the usurper
and their predilection for their rightful sovereign, we thought this
project an economical and a prudent one; and we believe from the
tenor of the President's address to both houses, not havlng then seen
the act of Co[n]gress of Feb. 6* that the measure would obtain the
support of our s uadron, and the approbation of our Government and
Country. I sha adhere to the position I have taken until the arrival
of Commodore Truxton; to whom I find Cap. Murray referred for
orders. And for m single self, on whom the weight of censure seems
to have fallen, if I ave surpassed the limita of that discretion which
1 suppose attached to my duty, I hold myself responsible alone to

e

E

my government for my conduct; not amenable to an inferior Captain
of a s uadron. * * *
*
* During the whole time of the Squadrons being in this
sea Tripoli has not been blockaded forty days until since the & I T ~ V
of the Swedes and the Boston. What is the consequence? The world,
and particularly these regencies, begin to whisper that The Americana
are playing the same farce here as the Danes! I do not undertake to
say that the commanders have not acted in conformity to orders But I cannot forbear repeating, what I have so often insisted on, and
what I fear we shall find true too late; Except more energy be thrown
into our operations against Tripoli, we shall fail in our object; and,
by a temporizing mode of warfare, encourage the other Barbary
powers to become insolent This will not be found the prediction of a
disorderedfancy! All the frigates of the U States employed in cruising,
or even in a blockade, are inadequate to prevent the small gallies of
the enemy from stealing out and doing us mischief. While the Consfellation was a t anchor in this bay, two of that species of cruisers
passed along the coast, and entered Bizerte, about 40 miles from this and, the next day departed in search of Americans. If they pass
over to capes De Gatt and Pallas, they will be very likely to catch
some of our merchantmen; except they fall in with Captain Sterret,
who is on that coast and who, no doubt, will give a good account of
them.
I labored to enforce my ideas of pushing the war on Cap. Murray's
consent. He says the system is neither in tho view nor the abilities
of the U States: but that we must rely on the magnanimity of Europe
to regulate these states altogether - Men and nations must undergo
more than a Christian regeneration before we shall see Europe volunteering in the protection of the commerce of the U States - To me
this appears the moment to fix our reputation in the view of these
piratical States - We should not be i n w e r e n t to it in the view of the
world. If the occasion be suffered to be lost the disadvantages will
be incalculable I have delivered the last regalia from England, saving the sword;
they were highly acceptable - and produced from the Bey permission
to ship provrsions - But after delivering the arms to the Bey, he
revived through his Minister, his former demand for a corvette or
brig of war - I got over this claim - a t least for the present.
I fear I shall not so easily do away that which arises out of my
measures with Mahamed Bashaw; if however i t should be insisted on,
by the Minister, I shall contend that i t is annulled on his part by
having proposed a new mode of treaty He then complained of a
violation of the neutrality of his coast by Cap. Sterrets having chased
a Tripolitan galley on his shore, and firing on her in that situation
(one of those above mentioned) I satisfied him on this complaint
without a saerijke.
Three da s ago entered a l a v e swedish ship laden with military
stores and eals, a present for t l s Bey As late as 220 ult. Tripoli had made no captures of our vessels nor

the measure projected here and that he has renewed his oath to wait
the junction of the American and Swedish squadrons a t Malta to
proceed with him before Tripoli. In fact, so confident is Mahamet
of the success of this enterprize that he has written this Bey on the
subject, stating to him his want of confidence in his brother, and his
resolution to seek other means, through the help of God, than those
recommended by this Bey, for the safety of his person and the restoration of his rights. His letter was read yesterday a t the palace in
presence of the Batavian Consul - The Eey expressed astonishment - and immediately observed that This is a project of the American! He did not express any uneasiness on the subject.
How is it that every Commander, as well as every body else who
has acted on this coast comes into this measure; and that those only
who have scarcely or never been here take on themselves to reject it!
I flatter myself that the sink of Jewish perfidy in Algiers will not always
have the address to blast the measures and disgrace the flag of my
Country!

give you my opinion candidly upon what seems by far the most important of your communications, reserving any strictures I may think
necessary to make on the rest of their contents for tbe subject of another letter. Hamoude Bashaw acknowledges his inferioritv but betravs his inten tion to watch for a favorable portunity to >ommit depkdations
on our Commerce if we do not vo untarily establish ourselvaq on the
list of maL?Nations, that are become tributary as Sweden & Denmark
are; the value of said degradations to be dictated by an ignorant
minister, & even then to hold our peace
of which to be subject to his caprice, thereby
& their property, to continual capture &
Slavery, whenever the Posture of &am in Europe would prevent
them from pursuing other game, & tho he does not intend to provoke
a war by sending the Agent of the United States away from his Dominions, yet he very modestly desires that the U. S. should send him a
consul more favorable to his Interests (ie) one who for the consideration of a tischera to load wheat or oil, would neglect to give the proper
Intelligence to his Govl& their Agents in order to counteract b vast
rojects of plunder & Captivity, but on the contrary would by his
h e n c e a t least facilitate his depredations, if not by mews more unjustifiable. I am really of opinion My dear Sir that no pains ought to be spared
LO cultivate peace & a good Understanding with the Barbary States
rovided i t can be effected upon terms of equality & that the resent
Executive aiu not have their administration stained by so agrant
a mark of Pusillanimity as an acquiescence to any of the Bashaws insolent demands that will in the least commit the honor or interest of
the United States or reflect dishonor on themselves or their agents,
especially a t t!& moment when we have i t in our power to impose
terms more congenial to our feelings and National rights, which if not
as favorable as those granted to other Nations must cerhinly be dishonorable & derogatory to our dignity as a Nation.
Can govl reflect without emotion that France and other Nations pay
only 3 pr C*ad &orem, on goods imported into the Regency of Tunis in
ships of their Nation while the same Merchandize im orted in an American bottom must pay ten a t least; can i t be congeni$to their feelings to
hear that ourships of war steal as i t were into the Bay of Tunis,without
receiving the customary compliment of a Salute while the Ships of the
most inconsiderable people on earth recieve that mark of respect &
we are the only Nation who are denied the satisfaction of seein that
t d h g homage paid to our fla ;our treaty with~unismostc e d y w i l l
be revised & a more favorab e moment than the present probably will
not present itself for many ears, I therefore cherish the Idea that Govt
will lasue orders to their o cers to endeavour to brush off the wings of
any impertinent insect that dare w a y a passage re ugnant to their
foelings & our Comodore is blessed with so stron a i estion that all
the flies in the Regency of Tunis would be hard& suffcient to excite
an other feeling but that of contempt.
%or some time I have believed a war with Tunis inevitable unless we
consent to give them all they demand from us; but I do not believe

t h r t e r the Danger the more honorable, but I never intend my
fa y shall again be exposed to the Caprice of a Barbarian. The
Bashaw's declaration is of much Importance and I make no doubt you
have communicated it to Govl as i t informs us what we have to expect.
You may depend Sir that any went appointed by Govt Will be supported b them. The French & British are tbe only Nations that are
respecte in Barbary. They have invariably continued their Consuls
in oposition to the threats & demands of those Regencies, insomuch
that I verily believe that the easiest way to procure the removal of a
French or British Consul would be to strongly recommend him to his
court & to solicit his being continued in office. The Policy of acting with firmness a t this moment is dictated by
imperious necessity, as the changing our Consuls at the Option of those
Bashaws would be changing our position & establishing ourselves in
the h t instance on the footing of a maU christian Nation in direct
contradiction to one of the favorite Maxims of the only nations who
are respected & if govc makes a sacrifice of their faithful officers; who
in God's name would volunteer their services to be paid b degradation? none but scoundrels who will enrich themselves at t e expence
of their fellow citizens; but we have little to fear on that head I t is
full as probable that the President & Senate of the U. S. will send a
Consul to Tunis without a beard with instructions to administer to the
Bashaws pleasure in a sensual beastly manner as to suppose for one
moment that they will replace a faithful officer in order to appoint
one who would be more friendly to the interests of Barbary than he
would be to those of his own nation. Comodore Truxton has resigned
& Caps Morris i t is said will have the command of our Squadron, it is
devoutly to be desired that they may arrive time enough to conclude
something a t Tripoli before the equinoctial gales come on, as after
that period the coast of Tripoli is by no means safe. I am in anxious expectations of instructions which I presume will
be definitive - Interim

the disagreeable Intelligence that three days since, two Tripoline
Galliots arrived a t this port, having escaped from Tripoli about
23 days ago, notwithstanding the Blockade of that port by the
Swedish & American frigates; they say also that three others came
out with them, which however I with d a c u l t y believe. Their stay here will probably be but short, & they publicly say that
they intend to cruize for Swedish & American vessels, that may be
pvithout Convoy.
The two Galliots beforementioned have each, two Masts, three
lntine Sails, four guns and about forty Men.

To Charles Pettit and Joseph Ball, of the Insurance Company of North America.
from Israel Whelen, U. S. Purveyor

GENTLEMENIt has been agreed b the Insurance Company of
Pennsylvania, and myself on behalf o the United States, by virtue
of Authority from the Comptroller of the Treasury; to submit to your
Opinion the propriet of a claim, for return of art of the premium
eace & Plenty, from New ork bound to Tunis,
on the cargo of the lJ
on which $20,000 were insured in their Office. With this you will
receive a Cop of the letter from me requesting Insurance to be
effected; the eorge Washingtons Voyage being connected with that
of the Peace & Plenty, the Orders for insurance on both cargoes were
given in the same letter, and as they are so blended that they cannot

be seperated, the letter is given to you entire. You will also receive
Copies of the instructions to Captains Shaw, & Wood, referr'd to in
the orders for insurance, & shewn to the insurers. - By the Instructions i t will be seen, that in every event both Vessels were to stop a t
Gibralter, and their future destination was to depend on different
contingencies: it was intended to insure against the risks which would
attend any, or all of them; if we were a t War with Tunis and a t peace
with Algiers, the Peace & Plenty was to deliver her Cargo a t Algiers;
if we were a t War with Algiers 8: Tunis the Vessels were to proceed
to such Neutral ports as agreeably to their instructions, they could
sell their Cargoes at; in effecting this purpose it might have been
necessary to stop a t many; on this Account a high premium was stipulated for, but if ~twere necessary to stop only a t one port, then a part
of the premium was to be returned. On arriving at Gibralter, it was
found that we were a t peace with Algiers & Tunis; the object of going
to other Ports to dispose of the Cargo was therefore a t an end; all
that was necessary was to go to Tunis in safety. Tripoli had broken
her peace with the United-States (the Notoriety of this is such that
i t has not been deemed necessarv to offer any proof of it) it was therefore requisite that the Peace & plenty should sail under convoy of the
George lT7ashington or some other Ship of War; (see the instructions)
she continued under Captain Shaw.
At Gibralter he could not obtain Water; although this article can
general1 be obtained there, yet at this time i t could not be spared;
Capt' haw was therefore necessitated to put into Malaga for a
Supply, and in doing this was bound to take the Peace & Phnty with
him to prevent her falling into the hands of the Tripolitans, and the
same line of conduct was necessary when he went into Algiers to
deliver his own Cargo. It is conceived that as the going into the
Ports of Malaga, & Algiers, was necessary for the furtherence of the
Voyage, & safety of Vessel & Cargo, and was unavoidable as i t respected the Peace & Plenty whose Captain was bound by Captain
Shawls Orders; that such cases are provided for in the body of the
Polic , & therefore do not a ply to risks which were contemplated if
the essel from a State of d a r e could not proceed to either Algiers
or Tunis - That as no such state existed, no additional risk was or
could be run by the Underwriters, the Vessels did not at any time on
their Voyage intend to go to any other Ports to unload, than those
they were originally destined for; i t was unnecessary; for neither
Algiers nor Tunis had broken their peace with the United States.
It is therefore respectfully submitted whether the Claim by the
United States for a return of One and an half per cent of the premium
on the Peace & Plenty is not well founded PHILAD*

TRIPOLIJuly 22Q1808
SIR I take this early opportunity to inform you of my capture I sailed with the Brig Franklin belonging to Mess* Summer and
Brown of Philadelphia from MarseiUes with an assorted Cargo for the
West Indies on the 8'-h ultimo, and on the night of the 17" following,
then off Cape Pallos, was boarded by one of three Tripoline Corsairs,
mounting four carriage and four swivel guns - that Sailed from this
place on or about the 209 May - I shall pass over the occurrences
of that night, as you are well acquainted with the conduct of these
Barbarians towards the unfortunate that falls into their hands They proceeded with the prize to Algiers, where we arrived the 26"
and as I conjecture by the representations of Mr O'Briens they were
obliged to make a hasty retreat on the 27'b following, but not without
giving me an additional Load of chains, what with calms and contrary
winds we did not reach Biserta in the ne' hbourhood of Tunis until the
7t4 instant where after a tarry of five ays we departed leaving the
Brig there in cha e of their Agent, and arrived here on the 19'.'
instant - througT the interferance of Mi Nissen his Danish Majesty's Consul here I have the Liberty of the Town, and b a lucky

man, and has obtained their release as British Subjects; two more that
were foreigners which I reported as assengers has likewise been
liberated, so that they have only myse and three Seamen captives
you will readyly agree with me that this will lesson the value of the
capture to the Bey - But I cannot pass over the disappointment I
experienced in not falling in with some of our Vessels of war during
one months Captivity on board the Corsair, especially off Cape Bon a
place that the necessity of strictly guarding, must appear to every
naval Commander a t War with Tripoli - But more on this Subject
if time will permit - the most provoldng circumstance was off this
place, when we had arrived within about five Leagues of the Port, the
Corsair with our flag reversed began accordmg their custom to Salute,
and so continued at intervals for more than five hours until we anchored in the Arbour; and strange to relate all this was done in view
of a Swedish and American Frigate, who never made the least effort to
obstruct our progress when i t was certainly in thire power to Capture
or run the Pirate on Shore before i t was possible for them to be proI do not wish to attack blame to any
tected from their batteries
man, but this transaction was in open day in Sight of thousands
amongst which the Consuls of different nations can testify - I have
not the honor of being known by you, but be assured that i t is not
from a ill heart, nor the thoughts of my Situation deprived of the
converse of a wife, family and friends, and what is dear to every
American, Liberty, that induces me to State the foregoing facts, It
is the exultation of these Barbarians a t Such conduct that gives me
pain The three Galliots are now all in Port, they are to Sail immediately,
it is said Morad Raiz, alias Lisle is to go in one of them or in a s m a
Italian Polacre of 12 guns M' N. writes fully on this subject. Sir
this conveyance which will enable you to take the proper steps to
inform our Ships of war, and Merchantmen in the different Port of
these Seas - I t was the assurances I had from all uarters of the
impossibility of their Cruizer to evade the vigilance o the Blockade
that led me to sea without convoy or Arms - fatal experience has
convinced me to the contr , for their small Vessels can go out any
night in the week that they p ease and penetrate as far to the westward
as Malaga, which .is mangest on a late occasion except a different plan is
adopted by our fleet; this leads me to make a few observations in the
station off Cape Bon - The vessels that the Tripolines employ
against our merchantmen are hght Gally's drawing from 5, to 6, feet
water; they depart from this in the ni ht, the next morning they are
8s far to the westward as Tripoli Vecc o, or the flat grounds of the
Salines, they proceed on along the Shore to Zerbis, they then strike off
about north and over the Shoals untill they get lnto the neighbourhood
of Susa, when the sometimes stop for provisions or information, and
then proceed on c ose in Shore to the Cape and soon to the westward
until1 they reach Algiers and then over to the Coast of Spain they
return in the same manner, with t h s difference that they leave their
prizes in the neighbourhood of Tunis, and come into t h s place with
the prisoners, a view of the Chart of these Coasts and Seas, and the
few remarks on their manner of proceedin . w i l l certainly convince
e v e v naval oficer, that one or two faat s&g vessels and a Frigate
Stationed off Cape Bon would effectually intercept every thing belong-

ing to the enemy going throu h between the Barbary shore, and the
Island of Sicily, and even shou fd Supiness [sic] or any other unforeseen
event excape our Vessels of War and get to the Westward, there would
be the chance of intercepting them on their return with the prisoners,
which would frustrate the views of the Bashaw and fulfill the object
of the War; one other Vessel if possible should Cruize off Susa the
land there forms a gulf or Bay (pretty large) which these Pirates
generally cross from point to point when they do not intend going into
Port; it is unnecessary for me to add that all round Cape Bon is a very
bold Shore with many anchoring laces, and on one S~deor the other
it will generally afford a Smooth L e for cruising Ships to watch and
way lay the Vessels of the Enemy and I am very much Surprized, that
it has escaped the notice of our Commanders so long; in fact Tunis,
Pallermo, and all the neighbourhood contributes for the conveniance
and refreshment for Cruizhg Ships, and but a short distance from their
Stations. - I t is hardly to be Supposed that any of them would
attempt the passage of the straights of Messina for fear of the Neapolitans, but it would not be amiss to watch them even there - Two
Ships employed in the blockade here to keep up appearances, for it is
no more, understand me - I mean a close Blockade without any
indulgences, not a t 6, & 8 leagues distance and oftentimes out of sight
for days; all the rest of our force should be employed in cruising
between Susa, Cape Bon, and Sicily; one Summer spent with vigilance
in this manner I am certain would convince the Bashaw that America
was in earnest procure me my liberty and an honorable peace for my
country - time will not permit me to be as correct in my remarks
as I wish, but I hope they will be Sufficient for abler heads to exercise
their judgements. Comodore Dale landed some troops belonging to
the Bashaw, which he had captured with a promise of some Americans in Exchange, he now makes some difliculties in performing his
promise I have not had time as et to enter into the merits of this affair,
but hope that Should any ripolines fall into the hands of our Commanders that they will hold them, perhaps the Bashaw will consent
to an Exchange for me.
I have desired my friends in Philadelphia to place as soon as possible
funds in your hmds for my use, but it will be some time before that
can be done - I wish you to inform me if it would be convenient
for you to make me Such advances as is absolutely necessary for my

1P June 1802 SIR ItS with great concern I am under the necessity of acquainting
you, that either the information given the Swedish Consul and myself
on Sunday last, respecting His Imperial Majesty having consented to
allow his Wheat Vessels to go to Tunis, was extremely fallacious on
the part of the Governour of Tangier, or the Emperour must have
very speedily repented of having taken that resolution. - This morning at Nine OClock the Governour sent for me a ain, to say he had
received fresh Instructions from His Majesty, wit Orders to demand
from me Passports for these Vessels to go direct to Tripoly, and in
case of refusal that I was to quit the Country, adding that the Letter
was written in such strong terms, as must prevent his consenting to
any mitigation. - After a very long conferrence, he a t last however
allowed me time to write to Commodore Morris a t Gibraltar, which
I am now about to do fully, -- on his answer will depend my remaining in this Country, or being compelled to retire from it. - As a

nothing possible for me to accomplish, for good of the Public Service

"DEARSIR,After having written you so lately as the 14th, that the
affair of his majesty's demands of passports for the wheat vessels for
Tripoli was accommodated, i t is with concern I have now to write you
in a very different strain. This morning, the Governor of this place
desired my attendance, when he told me he had received fresh instructions from the Emperor, on the subject of these passports, and again
to demand them of me, a t the same time to desire me to quit his
dominions, if I had not been authorized to grant passports for the two
vessels to go from Dare1 Beyda to Tri oli with wheat; he added that
his majesty would send a Ca tain anc r crew with his passport for the
ship that lies a t Gibraltar, w 'ch would be navigated under his flag.
At so t 'ng crisis, i t is a great consolation to me, to have you so near
to cons t with. The only indulgence I have been able to obtain from
the Governor, is a suspension of the execution of his majesty's order,

Zr

L

for my uitting the country, until I should write you and have your
answer, or of course I could not take upon myself to grant passports for
a voyage, on which I well knew they could have no avail. I must now,
my good Sir, entreat of you to consider, whether, your sanctioning
these two cargoes of wheat being sent to Tripoli, would not be a far less
national injury, than would, even only an alarm, of danger to the commerce of the United States in this part of the world; for although the
Emperor had not a single cruiser to send to sea, on the news of the
American Consul being sent from hence, the premiums of insurance
would start very considerably; besides which, there are just at this time
several American vessels actually at Mogadore, and others were ex-

9

of to the Governor, on what
of such a harsh measure on the part
my expulsion would totally defeat
the end, the threat of it was meant to attain, for after that, it would be
entirely out of your power to gratify his majesty, until you should
receive fresh instrucbons from America. Finding this made no impression, I even solicited time to write to the Emperor, or to wait the
return of the express sent him on Monday morning, to say the Swedish
consul and m self would grant the required passports for Tunis, but all
to no effect; e declared the Emperor's orders were so positive that
they admitted of no mitigation, and that it was only a strong mark of
his particular friendship that he gave me time to write to you. Thus
situated, I cannot otherwise than give you my opinion, that it is better
to grant the passports than to come to a rupture with this country.
However, you are the best judge what you can take upon yourself to do.
It is my duty to tell you, that I see not the least shadow of hope of my
being permitted to remain in this country, if the Emperor's request
be not complied with. I beg you will favour me with your answer by
the very earliest opportunity, either direct, or if the wind continues
westerly, by the way of Tetuan."

him by the Secretary of the Treasury, has made enquiry concerning the
most proper scite for a Marine Hospitd at Boston - and he has
recommended part of the ground purchased by the United States for
the use of the Navy Yard.
Five acres are stated to be necessary, and having no doubt of there
being ground enough belonging to the Department, to spare that
uantity for that object, I have acquiesced in the proposition of the
8ollector, with this proviso, that you shall have the selection of the
ground so to be appropriated.

SIR With this I be leave to enclose copy of 42, and am extremely

sorry to add the intakgence of my having been compelled by the
Governour of Tangier to retire from thence on Thursday Evening,
in consequence of positive orders from His Imperial Majesty to that
effect, received on the evening of the 22g, accompanied with advice of
his having declared War against the United States.
Agreesbly to what I had the honour of advisin you the 17", I
acquainted Commodore Morris the state of the Pu hc Affairs under
m care, and he came off Tangier Bay in the Chesapeake on the 20'p day following I was with him on board, when he acquainted me
the reasons prevented his gratifying His Imperial Majestys wishes in
regard to sending Wheat to Tri oly which was extremely distressing,
as I saw great cause to dread tFle consequences. - At landing I had
another interview with the Governour of Tangier, when I succeeded

%

TE~

186

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1802 TO 1803

in obtaining his promise to suspend again the execution of His Majesty's Orders received on the 16th for my expulsion, untill he could
represent to His Majesty, the impossibility he was then satisfied had
always existed to my granting the re uired Passports, since the
Commodore could not sanction them. --?I4
chief aim in this was to
have gainad time, for the arrival of the Adums, as I entertained great
hopes she would bring such dispositions from Government, as would
have enabled me to quiet the Emperours Irritation at least for some
time. The Messen er arrived on the Evening of the 16'p had still been
detained by dcayds Ashash, and on Tuandag morning he wassent
back, with a representation to His Majesty on the part of the Governour, to the above effect; and acquainting him of the encouragement I had given him to expect very favourable news by the Adums.
But same Evening a Soldier arrived with the Emperours second Order
for my quitting the Country immediately, in a state of War, that is the
best translation can be given of the Arabic Word used on the occasion. I t appears the Emperour declared at his Mushoar or Public Audience on the lgt@that he was a t War with the United States, and
directed that the utmost expedition should be used, in fitting out his
Cruizers. - When we consider how very trivial the object of sending
some Cargoes of Wheat, to be distributed in Charit to the poor at
Tripoly is, put in comparison with going to War wit a Nation, it is
scarce to be believed that the Emperour of Morocco would have
adopted so serrious a measure for that only object. - Yet I must
certainly say, no demand has at any time since I have had the honour
of being encharged with the Morocco Consulate been made of me,
besides the mentioned Passports; nor has any thing of an unfriendl
nature at any time been communicated to me, unless what passed wit
Bashaw Hackmawy on the 14" & 16" December last year, articulars
of which I had the honor of laykg before you s t large in
35. - I
would now write Muley Soliman, but as Commodore Morris has
ac uainted me, how much he has reason daily to expect to see the
~ & m I, conceive it better to excuse it, until1 that S h p arrives, that
I may not fall into the error of giving His Majesty room to hope for
more, than I may be authorised by you to do. I conceive it my duty to remain here now, until arrival of the
Adam, & I shall be extremely attentive to strive a t obtaining tbe best
information of what may happen in Barbary, res ecting theu sending
out armed Boats, which is my cheif fear; for it
be some time before
either the Frigates a t Rhabat, or half Galleys at Tetuan, can be ready
for Sea. - I have written Circulars to all the Chief Sea Port Towns
, advis'mg the Consuls of this new danger to Vessels of the
United tates, a copy I enclose for your erusal.
in
I was not without my fears that the pirit of the Emperours last
order, would have induced the Governour of Tangier to seize my
property there, but he has not done it; the short space a t last allowed
me, did not however enable me to bring away the whole, but I trust
what remains will be safe: the very Fnendly footing on which I was
with the Governour, I have reason to believe favoured me much in
this particular, for he might have acted very different to what he has
done, and pleaded His Ma'estys Letter last received, in justification. My House & Garden a t d o u n t washington I have left m charge of the
Spanish Consul. -

NAVYYARDWASHINGTON
2 P June 1802
SIRI have the honor to enclose You a memorandum of the particular dimensions, of the Frigate United States agreably to Your request
of this morning
Having i t in contemplation to cover the Dock with a roof over the
Ships i t would be adviseable to take out all the lower masts, before
entering it - and for this purpose Sheers should be erected at the
Dockhead - by which means the three Masts of each Ship may be
taken out, in three hours or less, and with the most perfect safety An excellent model of such a machine is now in the Navy Office,
brought from Toulon by Commodore Dale -This particular appendage
to the Navy Yard here, is now much wanted: as there is always great
risque in Sheers erected on Deck, for the purpose of taking in, and
out Masts, of such dimensions as those of our FrigatesThe waste of time is also great, as is the danger of moving the
Sheers on deck, and the labour too operose to be effected with a few
people. -I dare a f f i that the expence of taking out the Masts, which
must necessarily be shifted, of the Ships now here, ere they can proceed
to Sea; will by the last mentioned method, far exceed the cost of
erecting the Machine I would advise: and which would last many,
very many Pears.
I t is presumeable the Ships by being thus- and otherwise judiciously hghtened, to come into Dock- may be brought to 17 feet draft
of water, or under. The tight work therefore of the entering bason.
need not a t the extreme, exceed in height 40 feet. Stopping at this
height for the GROUND or SOLID WORK, the Eaves of the Roof need
not exceed 15 feet more perpendicular height, to admit LINE-OF
BATTLE-SHIPS, of two-decks.
The depth of water, at theBarin the Patowmac, near the the mouth of
Matawoming Creek (the shoales I believe in the river) is at high water,
common tides 23 ft 6 in to 23 ft 9 in and I should feel no ap rehension
of danger, or doubt of success, in the attempt a t a favorab e time, of
conducting any one of our largest Ships up - on a future occasion,
without lightening in the smallest degree, in point of expence.
Ever happ ,with energy to execute your commands
I have t e Honor to be with unfeigned respect

that he has resolved to repel the demand for an annuit of twenty
thousand dollars by force of arms, and will send a squa ron against
Tripoli as soon as he has settled his affairs with Great Britain.
Many of our merchants and captains dispute the consul's authority
to detain their vessels in port, notwithstanding the national consequences of their capture being fully explained to them. I therefore

government, and that positive instructions ought to be given to. all

QQ Jdy 1802 SIR With this I have the honour of transmitting triplicate of N? 43
whose original was forwarded by the Ship Dart for Norfolk, and copy
put on board another Vessel, by Commodore Morris. I have now to acquaint you, that yesterday I received a Letter from
the Governour of Tangier dated 30&June, advising that His Imperial
Majest (in answer to the Letter he wrote on the 224) had directed I
might e permitted to remain there six Months; - adding that in
consequence I was a t libertv to return to my House in Tangier, or not
as I should see fit. - Had this order arrived in time to prevent my
expulsion, all would have been well; as in the time mentioned a negotiation might have been carried on, and any differences accommodated; but i t appears to me since His Majesty saw fit to declare he
was a t War with the United States, and in consequence thereof to
direct, that their Consul should be driven from his dominions, something beyond this Letter from a Governour will be highly necessary. The Governour does not say for what purpose the space is limited
to six Months; i t would appear according to the custom of that
Country as if His Majesty expected some certain thing should he done
in that time, but on this the Governour is silent. - I should think as
the Emperour has been guilty of so flagrant a breach of the Peace,
subsisted between the Countries, that he should write a Letter, or give
some other Public testimony of his being in Peace & Friendship with
the United States as heretofore, before I can consistently return to
his Country in my public capacity. This however is a matter of such magnitude, as I cannot take upon
myself to determine precisely on, having Commodore Morris so near
me to consult with. - He sailed on thursday to Cruize off the Straits
& Coast of Barbary, the Enter rise anchor'd in this Bay yesterday, &
now proceeds in quest of the Cfe8apeake, with a letter from me for the
Commodore; in which I request the favour of seeing him as soon as he
conveniently can; when this point wiU be deliberated on, and such
measures pursued as shall appear most consistent with the dignity of
the United States, always having due regard to the Commercial
Interests.At this moment it appears to me we have a very fair o ening, for
comeing to an E lanation with the Em eror, and for !a oing away
those pretensions have for some time readed he was desirous of
bringing forward, on subject of more frequent Presents being made
him, but which i t would appear His Ministers have been a t a loss how
to enter upon. - On this occasion i t would be a hap y circumstance
if Commodore Morris could shew himself in force o the Emperours
Ports, for as I have often since Summer 1795 had the honour of stating
in my dispatches, there is not any thing has such weight, as shewing
the Moors that a Naval force is a t hand, to act against them in case of
N944. -

Bills on you for that sum, which I intreat may be paid; and the Amo*

Consulate. Before my departure from Barbary I claimed fulfillment of the 24'P

depart with their property. A Frigate which has layen some years neglected a t Larach, and
which the Swedish Consul wrote me when he passed there in March
last, was surrounded with sand banked up, the Emperour has directed
shall be fitted out, but I think it is scarce possible she can be made fit
for Sea. [NA. SDA. CL, Tangier, Vol. 1, 1791-1803.1
Extract from letter to Secretary of State from James Leander Cathcart, U. 8. exConsul, Tripoli

You will please to observe that the cruisers of ~ r i ~ dha&

ganger our merchant ships have been exposed to. From the returns
of our consuls you will be informed of the extent of our commerce in
this sea, which never was so valuable, as it was a t the period and since
the bashsw of Tripoli commenced hostilities. I have seen twenty-four
sail of American vessels in this port at once last year, two-thirds of
whom were unarmed. Can the wisdom of government devise no
means either to prevent the cruisers of Tri oli from putting to sea, or
our merchant shps from passin up the editerranean unarmed and
without convoy ; is it not possi le to prohibit them, (for their own
sakes) from coming past G ~ b r a l kunless armed sfficiently to defend
themselves when three or four are together, or under convoy of some
of our ships of war.
The bashaw of Tripoli seems disposed to enter into a treaty with us,
but upon what terms he has not yet declared. Mr. Eaton informs me,
that a roposition of peace on the part of the bashaw of Tripoli came

with all our diligence, & am m self seldom out of sight of the Town,
the other Ships stationed in a L e along the Coast, yet they do contrive to get their small row Galleys out, in the night, in defiance of
us, by rowbg close under the land, & taking shelter occasionally in
the small Ports, with which this coast abounds, for our parts, we dare
not venture too close in, on account of sudden Calms, & no Anchorage till you are nearly on the Beach, but if we are to continue this
Warfare, nothing can be more eligible to cope with any force they can
fit out against us, than a number of such Schooners as the Enterptize,
who can Row when becalrn'd, & be kept in an active state, with fewer
Frigates, we are not as yet advised of the Capture of any Americans,
but I much fear for my Countrymen, their Cruizers are so small, that
they can be taken for nothing more than Row boats, & much infest
the European Coast, they have now about 150 unfortunate Sweds,
some of whom they have march'd over land 300 Miles, with scarce
food to sustain nature, for when they Capture a Vessel, they take them
into the nearest Port, on the Barbary Coast, well knowing the risk
of takmg them by Sea, to prevent this, as much as possible, I have
proposed to the Admiral to decrease our force here, to two Frigates,
to kee up the Blockade & to employ the others as Convoy, which
he hat agreed to, in case our other Ships do not shortly arrive, they
are a t present very much distress'd for Grain I beg the favor of you to order the enclosed Letter to be forwarded -

Ciddi Daguize charges me to inform you, Sir, of the entire change
which has taken place a t Tripoli in respect to every thing that can have
any influence upon the affairs of the United States of America; those
persons who so streneously opposed Ciddi Daguize and his endeavours
to continue the peace between Tripoli and America, and who of course
where the cause of the declaration of war taking place are now under
the Bashaw's most severe disgrace Ciddi Da ize is persuaded that
the names of those Persons are perfectly we known to you, consequently he wishes to inform you that it is his opinion that this moment
would be the most advantageous to negociate a peace, and that you
would find his Excellency very much inclined to pay attention to
every overture that could bring about an accomodation between him
and the United States of America, whose peace with this Regency
would consequently be made upon the most favorable terms Ciddi Daguize leaves it to your own determinations whether you
will come yourself to open a negotiation or leave it to him to make the
advances

you in hi name, and which it is my duty to do refering to my private

To Snmmert & Brown, Merchants, Philadelphia, Pa., from William Eaton, U. 6.
Consul, Tunis

Triplicate TUNIB9, Jdy 1802.
GENTLEMEN,
The painful duty devolves on me to advise you, that
on the 7. instant the Brig Franklin, Captain Andrew Morris, was
brought into Bizerte a port in this regency, prize to a Tripoline corsaire; and yesterday, together with her cargo, was put up a t public
auction in this City - She was laden a t Marseilles, on our account,
Thomas, &
with wine, oil, soap, silks, erfumes, hats &? bound to
was captured off cape Pal os - The amount of her cargo, as per
invoice, is Franks 51948.18 I cannot obtain permission to speak with the Captain and consequently do not know what kind of treatment the people have Suffered
from their captors. They will be carried to Tripoli, where they also
will be cried for sale a t public auction, like so many cattle; or, perhaps,
stationed on the batteries to slay & be slain by their Countrymen.
There are five corsaires of the enemy out; chiefly small gallies, which
paw along the coast of Barbary and other neutral countries, sufficiently
near to cover themselves, and thus evade the vigilance of our ships of
war - It is impossible to block Tripoli with lar e ships so as to
revent these row-boats from stealing out; it is equa ly impossible for
h e ships to catch them when out: they may have a rendezvous in
every port on the Barba coast, where they may sell their prizes and
take in provisions - ~ T a v never
e
ceased to suggest these dangers
to the proper department - and an opinion that we have no remedy
against the evils resulting from them but by taking a decided position
against Tripoli; or by covering their coast with small vessels of war.
That regency has not, a t this moment, a
le vessel able to fight
the Schooner Enterprize - If then it is inten ed to carry on a naval
war, until theresourses of Tripoli shall be exhausted, it is best to employ
in the service man such vessels: experience has proved to U S. that
they are more use ul than frigates in this kind of warfare - And it
mems that it is from experience alone that men and nations will be
convinced of their danger, or of pro er measures of defence - But
this mode of carrying on the war
not do: Let our fellow Citizens
be persuaded, before it be too late that except more energy be thrown
into our operations, we risque to piay a farce here, which in its progress

will entrain the most disgraceful and the most inhuman sacrifices: our
property captured and sold without the most distant prospect of
indemmty - and our Citizens dragged to Slavery and goaded to a
lingering death under the bastinade of merciless robbers. And, what
is still more humiliating, after all this we shall be compelled to prehase
a peace on the terms of an unprincipled, overbeamg Bashaw of a
wretched dog-kennel, without at all remedying the evil - If America
eld to this, and look the world in the face without a blush, let
can
her lot the stars from her escutcheon and vie1 with sack-cloth the
sun of her former glory - But concessions will not end here: The
moment we subscribe to the demands of Tripoli we shall have Tunis
and @em, in a more imperious tone, demanding mope substantial
proofs of the veritablefriendship of the President of the United States!Does not all experience prove to us that these States, when under
no restraint of fear, never want a pretext for war where they
have a prospect of gratifying their avance? And what guarantee
have we against this s p i ~ l tof rapine more than any other tributary
nations?
Does our Country rely on the magnanimity of the greater nations
of Europe to interfere for us? When the Lyon and the lamb shaU lie
down together this event may take place - But, believe me, Gentlemen, i t is neither the magnanimity of great nations, nor yet the Millennium which will redress the aggressions we suffer and shall continue
to suffer from these Regencies: we must seek i t only in our own
resources I n order to give validity to the facts stated in the preceding letter

I t is absolutely necessary that some one of our vessels of force
should be constantly about this quarter, and that we should have
freequent communications together - This is a rendezvous for our
enemy - and I have always been careful to advise our commanders
of t h s danger; but if Gentlemen think proper to neglect such advise
as well as to blast, at discretion, all measures I project to distress the
enemy and save our wretched seamen from chains, I am not responsible
for the consequences.
I shall go to Bizerte to day, and try by stratagem or intrigue to get
our captives out of the hands of the Rais; though with but a melancholy prospect of success. I hope at any rate that this advise may
reach you in season to take the proper measures to retake them on the

- 13 July 1802 I t is the command of the President of the United States, that
immediately on receipt hereof, you proceed with the Frigate Bostm to
this place where it is intended she shall be laid up in ordinary in the
Eastern Branch.
On your arrival a t the mouth of the Potowmac. you will engage a
proper pilot; if you can get John Gough who hves near Leonard
Town, you will give him the preference: He has sounded the river
& can bring as he says, 20 feet to the mouth of the Branch. [Similar letter to Captain William Bainbridge, U. S. Navy, in U. S. Frigate

- 13 Jdy 1802. The advantage possessed by this place of having several streams of
running water at considerable elevahons above the tide has su gested
the practicability of having a dry dock on the principie of a ock, in
which our Frigates may be laid up dry and under the shelter of a
roof so as to kee them in a state of perfect preservation during any
length of time w atever, and to save us the serious expence of those
constant repairs which will be requisite as long as they lie in the
water, and exposed to the sun. The streams which present themselves
are l e i Young's Branch, 2 V h e Tyber, 3 4 The Potowmac. To determine which stream may be most advantageously used, and
to enable the Legislature to decide ultimately on its expediency, it
will be necessary
188 - To ascertain the highest point to which the tide water has
been ever known to rise at the Navy Yard. 2'J - To find points in Young's Branch & the Tyber 24 feet above
that. This being proposed as the depth of both the upper & lower
basons. - To ascertain the quantity of water yielded by those streams
in a given time. 4'9 - To examine the height of the water in the Potowmac-Canal
above the tide water and the distance from that to the Navy Yard. These are operations which I must request you to have performed
immediately, & to superintend and to report the result to me for the
consideration of the President. -

Dispatch NO 9
LEGHORN
J d y 15tb1802
SIR I cant find words expressive of my feelings when I contemplate
the national consequences attending the capture of the brig Franklin,
had those pirates got her crew safe into Tripoli, it would have reduced
us nearly to the same humiliating situation that the Swedes are in,
as it is, i t proves that we cannot evade the depredations of the most
insignificant cruisers of the most insignificant Barbary State - What!
after the pains that had been taken to defeat the projects of the Bashaw of Tripoli aided by his colleagues a t Tunis & Algiers (in the first
instance even before we had any force in the mediterranean) had been
attended with success even beyond our most sanguine expectations,
$ we were upon the eve of concluding a treaty upon terms which
would not only have been honorable to the United States as a Nation,
but would have establish'd a precedent worthy the imitation of other
nations, & have founded n basis on which to establish our peace with
the rest of the Barbary States in future, to be thus lull'd into a false
security which has in a great measure blasted our most sanguine hopes
is distressing beyond parallel, to have our vessels ca tured while the
squadrons of the U, S of America & of Sweden are ending their aid
to protect our commerce implies something very unfavorable to our
energy & undoubtedly will be construed much to our disadvantage
by the heads of the Barbary States, this I presume will manifest
itself in the next communications we receive from Tripoli, for you
may depend Sir that this event small as i t may appear will produce
an entire change of sentiment in that Bashaw, elated with t h s small
success he will fit out all his Cruisers at different times, & nothing but
the capture of one or two of them will place us in the same point of
view that we were in before this misfortune happen'd Mr OBrien has acted judiciously in endeavoring to redeem the
crew of the brig, that is those not included in the arrangement for
exchange of prisoners made by Comodore Dale on the 3sd of September last, no pains or expence ought to be spared to prevent the ossibility of any of our fellow Citizens being carried to Tripoli, gut I
cant think it conducive to our interests to expend publick money to
ransom the brig & cargo, but on the contrary i t is establishing a pernicious precedent. "In the gtQ Article of our Treaty with m e r s it is
particularly specified "That if any of the Barbary States a t War
with the United States of America shall capture American vessels &
bring them into the Ports of the Regency of Algiers, "they shall not
be permited to sell them but shall depart the port on procuring the
requisite supplies of provisions
As the S h p s of War of the United States of America as well as
those of Sweden are a t sea, it is more than robable that she may be
exclusive of the brig
recaptured before her arrival a t Tripoli &
being arm'd to Cruize against us, if she is a fast sailer, I concieve their
is little difference between the Bashaw of Tripoli capturin our vessels
& those captured by Great Britian France & Spain the oss is equal
to our Citizens; besides i t is attended with this consequence, i t will
be apparently lessening the risque of navigating those seas by assuring our fellow Citizens that govt will redeem both them & their
property when captured as well as serve to revent the Algerines from
performing their engagements with us. As or any security the master
may give, in the k t place it can't be lawful unlem the property is

his own, in the next i t would cost the United States too much time
trouble & expense to enter a suit against the underwriters, perhaps i t
would likewise be impolitic in the present crisis On the lo* ins! Mr Appleton & myself endeavor'd to dissuade the
Masters of vessels now in port from sailing until some of our Frigates
or those of Sweden arrives to take them under convoy, but without
effect, they seem a t present as they ever have seem'd, intent upon
gain only, without properly appreciating the risque, they have ever
been duly forewarn'd of their danger when any existed, if afterwards
they chose to precipitate themselves & crews to destruction regardless
of their liberty & the national consequences of their capture, I hope
they w i l l do the Agents of the United States the Justice a t least to
own that we have been indefatigable in giving them timely information
in order to prevent them from rushing inconsiderately upon ruin &
what is worse, Slavery P. S, Their is a report circulated that Comodore Morris is arrived

In refusing to sanction such a communication with Tripoli, as we as

you pursued a plain course of duty, on which you justly counted on
the approbation of the President. Your readiness to grant the usual
certificates in favor of vessels bound with Morocco property for Tunis

2YtQJuly 1802 SIR I had the honour to receive by Captain Campbell of the
Adams, the Letter you wrote me on the 30t@April; to which I must
pray ou will excuse my replying a t length this morning. - I t was
consi ered by Commodore Morris & myself proper, that I should pass
over to this lace, for the purpose of more speedily and effectualy
mctkeing the ornmunications you encharged me with, for His Imperial
Majesty on part of the President. - I accordingly landed here last
Night out of the Enterprise, under a Flag of Truce, when I found the
Governour had sat out in the morning for Tetuan; whither I shall
follow him tomorrow, and after the necessary interview send a Messenger with an Address to His Majesty on the subjects you have
directed. In the mean time I have to acquaint you, that the Frigate a t Larach
lays quite ready for Sea, and that her Commander left this place on
Sunday, fully authorised to capture American Vessels. - I have acquainted Commodore Morris of this circumstance & entreated of him
to employ the Adums in preventin her puting to Sea, and the
Schooner in watching the motions of t e two Gallies a t Tetum. - An
impression made upon them in this way now, would have the best
effect; for the present Armament of the Em ror, p by no means
destined only against American Vessels, but
ag-t
those of all
other Nations, who have not actual Consuls resident with hun.- I
shall do myself the honour of ad
sing you farther from Tetum,
after having had m interview with the Governour. -

212

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1802 TO 1803

you were requested to use your endeavours to bring about this mode
and rate of paying the annuity, as a permanent regulation. It has
been some disappointment not to have learnt by any of your subsequent communications, whether such an experiment had been made,
or how far another remittance of a like sum, would be likely to be
accepted b the Dey. From your silence i t has been inferred that
the Dey di not enter fully into the plan of a permanent commutation,
but from his acceptance of the payment for one year! in money when
placed before his eyes, and from the motives which h s advlsers probably feel to favour that mode of payment, the President has determined to remit another sum of 30,000 dollars, as a commutation for
the current annuity in stores.
The money will be conveyed to Algiers in the ship Generd Green[e],
commanded by Lieutenant Chauncey, and will be delivered to you
on her arrival there. You will take the occasion to renew to the Dey
assurances of the friendly dispositions and good faith of the United
States, and of their confidence in his; will inform him that the remittance in money is made in the expectation that he will find it not less
acceptable than in the former instance, as well as from an anxiety to
avoid the unpunctuality sometimes inseparable from the trapsportation of stores; and in case he cannot be prevailed on to receive payment in this mode you will assure him that the letter of the Treat
shall be complied with, as soon as the President shall know his refusac
and the stores can be transmitted. You will also avail yourself of
the occasion, if i t should prove favorable, for another attempt to draw
the Dey into a permanent regulation for satisfying the Treaty by an
annuity of 30,000 dollars in place of stipulated stores. The evident
advantages of such a c h q e in our engagements, will call for your
best exertions to eccompllsh it.
I n case the Dey shall positively refuse to take the money in lieu of
the stores, you will deliver the 30,000 dollars back to Lt Chauncey,
unless one of our frigates should happen to be with you. In that case
i t will be better because safer, to place the money in charge of the
Captain of the frigate.

July 27'Q 1802
DEARSIR Your favors of 17tP June & l l t h July I have had tho
honor to receive both yesterda ; the first has undoubtedly been
detained, with a great many ot er letters for the Consul here, a t
Gerbi aa there is arrived to Tri oli Several Courriers in this month
only having dispatches for the ashaw.
The 21th instant I httve had the honor
inform yoli, Sir, of the
arrival of the Captain Morris & 8. men as risoners, of whom, however
five are liberated. By a Greek Vessel %at departed from here the
20tQin the morning I have had opportunity to inform Captain Murray
of the U. S. Frigate ConsteUation, of the Capture that tbe Tri oline
Cruizers have made. In the last five days I have not Seen any &ate
off the Port.
From my last letter of 22Q M a y till lStQJuly nothing or very little
of consequence has occmed at Tripoli. A vessel de arted from here
to Marseilles by which I have write to Consul Cat cart. In a few

days will de art from here 3 or 4 Gallies, & certainly the blockade of
thL9 port wdneither prevent them from going out, or returning with
prizes I am certain that the frigate ComteUation must have observed
the American Colours on board the Cruizers when Corning in the lgth
instant. I t is very seldom that I have any opportunity to correspond
with the Commanders of the Situation of the affairs here, and particularly of tbe contents of my Letters to Mr Cathcart of 23tQinstant
which I had taken the liberty to forward to you, Sir, and Left i t open
for your perusal. Should the Bashaw persist in refusing to comply
with his promise by an authentic tisquere to Commodore Dale last
year, of exchanging the remaining American prisoners the Commodore
who is to Succeed Commodore Dale ought to Send a letter a Shore to
the Bashaw to inform him that however the orders he may have from
the President of the U. S. of America to enter into a negociation for
peace, he cannot begin any Such negociation, till a prior promise &
convention with the U. S. is fulfilled or pay any further attention to
what the Bashaw might promise when he t h k s so little of a former
engagement in Such authentic a manner. These informations I shall
not be able immediately to give to the Commodore, and they are
however necessary for him to Know. The Bashaw desirous of a
peace will comply, believing this the only way conducive to an
accomodation.
Please, Sir, by the fir[s]t occasion to inform me if and when you
received my letter of 21 th instant original? (having forwarded duplicate) as i t contained Likewise a letter from Captain Morris, with
informations to the great Service of the affairs in the present circumstances; I had sent the letters away by an extraordinary occasion to
Gerbi, and therefore ordered a Courrier to Tunis, & now I wish to
See in how many days they are arrived. Permit me Sir to resent
my thanks for the Gazettes and other news contained in your etters.
Tripoli is entirely Sorrounded by Camps of Arabs all the different
tribes that acknowledged the authority of the Bashaw are here, of
Course a numerous Army, their Xeicks have their quarters in the
town to be more Sure of their fidelit . This year has proved a great
deal richer in grains than ever could e expected, so that the Blockade
from that Side neither Seems to be of much Service, or so as last year
was the Case.
This is all that I have to communicate a t this time, and be Sure,
Dear Sir that you Shall never want any intelligences of these quarters
that can be of any Service whenever I shall be able to get any Letter
r
forwarded.

DEARSIR Mine of the 226 Inst [see under date of 17 June 1802
premised a few Hints on the importance of stationing some of the
American force off Cape Bon, during five weeks captivity on board
one of their Gallys, I think has made tolerable well acquainted with
there manner of proceedbg - there Vessells that they make use of in
the summer season are hght Gallys drawing from 5 to 6 feet for the
convienance of rowing and going into shoal water they leave this
place in the night with the landwmd the next morning they as far to
the westward as Tripoli Vecho, or the flatt grounds of the Salines,
consequently out of sight of any of the ships forming the blockade here,
they proceed on to Jerbis, they then strike off to the Northward over
the shoals, until1 they reach the Neighbourhood of Susa, where they
sometimes stop for refreshments information &q and then continue
on close in with the shore to the Ca e and away to the Westward as
far as Algeirs and then over to the oast of spain, Cape Pallas Cape
St Martins the Island of Ivica and the Bay of Oropesa are their
principal stations for Cruizing - and they return the same way and
m the same cautious manner; with this difFerance that their orders are
to leave all prizes a t Benetta or Port Farino, and come on to this
place only wlth the prisoners a View of the Chart of these coast and seas with these few remarks
on the manner of their proceeder will certainly convince eve
Commander, that only two smah Vessells and one Frigate tationd
off Cape Bon would effectually intercept every vessell going thro h
between the babarey shore and the Island of Sicilly, even should y
any unforeseen event one of them evade the vigilance of our Ships and
gitt to the Westward they could hardly escap on their return with
the risoners, the capture or destruction of thew Gallys would frustrate
the iews of the Bashaw and answer the intent of the War - NB I t
is a maxim with these fellows to keep so Close in as to be able to make
their escape on shore in case of Chasers
one other Vessell should cruize off Susa. the land forms there a
Gulf or deep ba which the ] generally cross from point to point
It is unesaa,aa,ry or me to ad that all round Cape Bon is a h e bold
shore with many Anchoring laces and one side or the other affords
with the Islands in the ~eiggbourhooda smooth Lee, to watch the

motions of an Enemy - one of the small Vessella could a t intervals
go as far as Berzetta and it is very easy to cutt out any prizes they
may have to anchor in that open bay - I t is not to be supposed that
any of them would attempt the Streqhts of Massena, but it would be
not amiss to watch them even there - In a few words two shi s
employed in the blockade here, understand me I mean a Close Bloc ade mth no indulgence, and not at the distance of 5 & 6 Leagues and
oftentimes out of si ht for several days, and even when they are,

MY DEAR SIRThe Frigate Boston arrived here from Naples day
before yesterday, and leaves here tomorrow morning without Convoy
or with one or two only, there are several Americans in Port who w d
we ready in 3 or 4 days who have this day wrote him requesting him
to stay, but he is determined to sail in the morning - we shall touch
a t Merseilles, and a t the different Ports on the Spanish Coast for
Convoy but fancy he will get as few as he does here as it is impossible
for Merchant Vessels to get read in an hour, should he remain here
3 or 4 days and write to the J e r e n t Ports they will have time to
prepare - we arrived a t Naples from Malta - but CaptQMoN[eill].
reported himself from Syracuse a place I never saw - to avoid being
Quaranteened - On our passage from Malta we lost our Surgeon who
had been a long time unwell but was not thought dangerous, -he died
very sudden1 - a t this time I was confined to my bed with a violent
fever which hsted me 16 days I am geting better very slowly - I
knew nothing of the Doctors death for 11 days after it happened I yesterday aaw Mr Cathcart who is very well - Mr[B] C. I have
not seen she is at Pisa - and I have not had sficient strength to go
there
I have seen your letters respecting the Capture of the unfortunate
Captv Morris and Crew at whch I feel as I ought - perhaps Sir you
ma recollect that Last Summer Commodore Dale Captured a number
of k p o l i n e Merchants which given up on Condition of releasing a
number of Americans should they unfortunately fall into their hands
I think the number was 16 - of which I am however not certain

letters, which contain important information, and which doubtless has
been forwarded to you dlrect from Gibraltar. On the 12*@inst arrived here from Magadore, the Brig Active of
Newbury Port, Cap: Jacob Noyes & Schooner Camden of Baltimore,
Cap5 Nathaniel Cannon, which Port they had left three days before
in consequence of M: Simpson's letter. From the information they
brought me, I took the liberty of recommending it to them not to
return to Magadore: notwithstanding which, m they had left a considerable proportion of their property there, they resolved on returning,
and s d e d from hence on the 2la! inst I hope their rashness may not
prove fatal to them
If the President should deem it expedient to order a Frigate to
Cruise off this Island and the Canaries, it would certainly be attended
with great advantage to our Trade; as there is a considerable intercourse between the United States and this place, and we are on1 two
hundred and forty three miles distant from Magadore, from w ence
and Soffia, many Cruisers will doubtless be fitted out. I shall make it a point to communicate such information relative to
the Barbarians as I may from time to time recieve. I beg leave to inform you, for the satisfaction of his friends that John
Joyce a mariner belonging to the Brig Lzlcredia of Hartford, Captain
Francis Bulkle , died here (in the Hospital appropriated to the reoep
tion of Invali American Seamen) on the 23d inst after a few days
illness. His death was occasioned by the breaking a blood vessel on
board. He informed me he belonged to Brattleborough, in the
State of Vermont. - On the day after his death I had him decently
interred. - Enclosed you have an inventory of his effects, which are
really not worth his friends lookin after. - It is to me a circumstance highly gratif

have been admittd?%to the Hospital, this has been the only death
that has occur'd for these five years past

the destressb account of the Capture of one of our Brigs you have
also inclosed, y which you Kiu perceive that we have but a distant
prospect of Peace I thought i t woud not be amiss to sound the Bashaw's disposition
circuitously, to be prepared against an instructions that might come
out, but I foresee that the Capture o this Vessel will raise new obstacles; We cannot kee those small Galleys in Port & they being in
every respect so like
the small craft that navigate these Seas &
lurk so near the Land, that the best security for our Commerce, will be
to offer Convoy, from Port, to Port, to such Vessels as wish to avail
of our rotection, & if we are still to carry on this kind of Warfare, be
assure Sir, that i t will be necessary to encrease our force, with Brigs
or Schooners which will be fully ade uate to any force they can have to
encounter with belonging to l'rip& & they can pursue their small
craft in any direction where Frigates cannot venture provided they
have sweeps, to row after them for few of their Galleys carry more than
8 Guns & forty men, in the Winter Season the seldom venture out
nor will it be safe for us to be on this station on t a t Season I hope we have given them a good check for the resent; on the
22g Ins$we discovered their whole fleet of Gun boats, a out three miles
to leeward of the Town, consisting of eight sail, with the Admirals
Galley, mounting long 24, & 18 p' Brass Guns full of Men, we crouded
all the sail we coud to cut them off from the Forts, & had nearly succeeded, but they plyed their Oars, & sails with such energy that by
the time we got within Gun Shot of them, we were within reach of the
Shot from their Batteries which began to fire upon us, however we
resolved to attack them & stood on till we were within a mile & a half
of the beach, most of the boats had by this time got nearl on shore,
the Admiral then began to fire upon us, as did the other Ga eys, when
we rounded too in 12 fathoms Water, (our Pilot being much alarmed
in standing in so near the Land) & gave them a very severe fire for
about half an hour, which must have done them considerable damage, a t the same time they had an Army of a t least 6000 Men drawn
up along the Beach to protect them which our shot put to the route,
as the wind was in such a direction that we coud not lay longer in our
wanted osition we where obliged to haul of[f], when they got up under
the W s of the Town Whether this Brush will operate for or against a peace I know not,
i t will a t any rate convince them that we do not regard their formidable
Gun Vessels, & i t had a pleasing effect upon our Young OfEcers, who
stood their h e admirably well -the next day we stood in close to the
Town but they did not honor us with another salute I t hath now been nearl two months that we have seldom been out
of sight of the Town & I ave not yet had a word of intelligence from
the U. States since I left it, I fear somethin hath befallen our Vessels,
from that uarter, I also dispatched the ntetprize as Convoy to an
American &up from Tunis on the 3'3 of June to proceed to Gibralter if
thou ht necessary, since when I have had no information about her,
the ostm also left this on the 26th UltQfor Malta to procure provisions to return without delay & have never since heard of her tho she
ought not to have been one more than ten Days & now I run ieft quite

a month, tho possibly the might have been as well employ9 elsewhere,
yet I think we ought to s ew ourselves off Tripoli as often as possible,

I farther beg leave to represent to your majesty, that having found
i t impossible to obtain from Europe the 100 gun carriages your majesty
was pleased last year to desire I would endeavour to provide for you,
(as I had the honour of advising your majesty a t that time) it became
my duty to represent that disappointment to the government I serve.
The President, desirous of giving your majesty a proof of his friendship, immediately directed that one hundred gun carriages, such as
your majesty desired me to procure, should be made, and sent by a
vessel to Tangier for your majesty's use, so soon as they could be
finished. Although the great distance of America from this country,

Ship mentioned to be at Larach, was destined to detain American
Vessels, as well as others; and shewed me His Majestys original Letter
written b himself, authorising Hashash to give directions to the
Captain or that effect, the Ship being placed entirely under his
direction. Happily Commodore Morris being at hand with the A&am &
Enter-e,
the prevailing oppinion in this Country was against
risqulng the Ship a t Sea, which circumstance has aided me on this occasion, beyond what I can express, and I very muchhope has made such

an impression on these people with mpect to the American Navy, m

authority he had given for the Larach S h p take* Americans, provided I would ant the Captain the usual CerMcates, given by
Consuls to the mperours Cruisers, that he might put to Sea; but
that I positively refused, or to sanction any Vessel w h a ~ v ebelonging
r
to the Emperour going to Sea in any degree Armed, until1 such time
as His Majesty should see proper, to give the most positive declaration of his berng at Peace as heretofore with the United States. After many arguments on both sides Hsshash promised he would
recommend to His Majesty to desist from his hostile intentions %ahst
the United States;- as I perfectly beleive he was the chief Instgator
with the Emperour for makeing the essay he has done for War, I
considered that as a great point ained. - Accordingly it was agreed
both him and me should b e 'ably write His Majesty, and enclosed with this I have the honour of transmitting copy of my Lettsr,
which I beg you d be good enough to lay before The President,
together with this dispatch, for his information on what has been

-

At this moment I have the highest gratification in saying, I enjoy
great hopes of a speedy accommodation; but s t m e time altho' I
have the conscious satisfaction of knowing that every exertion possible in my power has been made for paveing the way for it, even during
the time I was in Gibraltar, by endeavouring to gain my Friends near
the Emperour to our Interest, yet I must candidly say had there not
been a Naval force at hand to keep their Cruizers m Port, I ve
much doubt if all I could have done, would have been attended w
i

that success, I now so much ho e for. - The intelhgence I was

when it srrives I shall seize the earliest opportunitys for conveying it

been discussed and &hash had romised to write the Emperour in
the terms I have mentioned, he as ed me if I would not grant a Passport for His Majestys Schooner to go from Rhabat to the Coast of

tion of any other frigate having appeared before Tripoli - Inclosure

C. is a copy of a letter from Mahomet Bashaw, the Tripoline. In
my actual situation I can give it no answer.

On the 23d ult. I fell in with a Tripoline merchant a t the Swedish
house, who informed me that the circumstance of Mahomet Bashaw
being a t Malta had excited great emotion a t Tripoli; that the reigning
Bashaw was much alarmed; and that, to prevent an insurrection in
the interior in favor of the brother, the Bashaw had siezed and confined several chiefs of principal villages - On the contrary, that his
subjects build on this circumstance a hope of returning peace and a
milder administration. That a spirit of Universal hcontentment
and revolt pervade all clases of the subjects except a few personally
attached to the reigning Bashaw - And that they generally think
it the interposition of Heaven that their rightful Sovereign is to be
restored to them and their oppressor punished - I do not vouch
for the truth of these facts; though they correspond with every thing
which has come to my knowledge on the subject.
The reigning Bashaw has caused as many shirts, or robes to be
constructed as he has prisoners, payed with pitch and sul her; and
he swears he will burn every Amencan and Swede he sha 1 have in
possession the moment a shot is fired on the town. Shall such a
monster live, and dictate laws to nations who could crush him!
This morning the Algerine Jew, Azulai, informed me that, a few
days ago, letters passed through his hands from the De of Algiers
to the Bashaw of Tripoli, demanding the immediate re ease of the
American Captives; stating that the Americans were his best friends,
they alone having come forward to give him a transport to Constantinople when he had great need ;and that these dispatches were accompallled by letters from M' OBrien - I have received no communications from this Gen? since the 15. May - and, if AzulaiJs statement
be true, I should be at loss to account for his taciturnity on the subject
with me if I did not percieve in the transaction a perseverence of the
original progect of placing the affairs of the U States in these Regencies
in the controle of a cordon of Algerine Jews stationed a t the different
capitals; as well as to gloss over the insult of sending the Geo. Washington to Constantinople - I apprehend the Dey's claim will succede like his guarantee of the peace: it is possible however that the
Bashaw's dependence on the Dey for supplies may induce h i to
concede-if so it would be a happy circumstance - I have put in
a claim for our prisoners in exchange for those which Commodorc
Dale released last summer, taking the Bashaw's promise for seven
Americans when captured.
There is some misunderstanding between Hamuda Bashaw and
the Regency of Algiers; but I neither know the cause nor its tendency.
It is certain however that this Bey h a some apprehensions of hostility
from the circumstance of his h a ~ m g f a n n e da camp of three thousand
men which will march tomorrow towards the frontier of Constantine
to observe the motions of an Algerine camp in that quarter.
I t may not be improper to state here, that on m first appearance
a t Bardo, the palace, after the capture of the brig ranklin, the Bey
indulged himself in a vein of satire on the occasion "You keep"
said he "a ve close blockade before Tripoli - your frigates appear
to be very vi&nt -But supposing you were to undertake to blocade
a thousand miles of sea coast how many such vigilant frigates would
you employ on the service?" I answered this sarcasm by saying that

f

i

%

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS

225

the enemy had not much to boast of in having picked up, after more
than a year's warfare, one poor brig and nine defenceless seamen.
We expected more than this from the formidable armament he had
fitted out. But this, though i t would naturally tend to make him
more insolent, rnigh t eventually produce effects quite different from
what he caaculated from it. "We shall see," said the Bey with an
air of visible contempt. What will he say after having seen the
pitiful galliotte pass triumphantly into port in plain view of two
frigates of the allies, the boats of either of which could have captured
him! I t is but just however to acknowledge that the Bey refused
permission to march the captives through his territory - I remonstrated against i t in hopes that, going by sea, they might be recaptured.
Captain Murra 's officers asserted to me that he never brought
to a single vessel rom Gibr to this port; tho' he passed several, some
with moorish colors - The procedure of this Commander respecting
my measures has thrown me into great embarrassments and obvious
disgrace here - and, except Government support those measures i t
is necessary to replace me - The honor, the interest of the nation
dictate i t - and candor dictates this confession - But let not my
successor be an Algerine Jew. Give him a salary sufficient to support him - and take care that he is prohibited commerce here.
I have realized all my own predictions in this instance - I have fallen
into the hands of tigers, who will fleece me In m communications of Stb June I mentioned having named
Lewis argreaves to take charge of this office in case of my decease
or necessary absence, Captain Humbert having previously resigned
his appt into my hands in consequence of apprehensions of difEculties with which this Bey menaces the Batavian Republic. Mr
I-Iargreaves has since taken a resolution to remove with his family
to E n land - I shall name Captain Holck, his Danish Majesty's
cons$, to this trust.
There seems to be some rnisintelligence between the french Government and the Dey of Algiers - the English also. If America
had no commerce the immense treasure concealed in the vaults of
the palace of Algiers would not have lain so long in security.
This Bey has been late1 visited by a Spanish ship of the line and
is Catholic Majesty menaces
three frigates. The last etter from H
the Bey with his whole naval force in case he persists in his demands He answered laconically - "Let them come!" The same policy
which secured the treasure of Algiers will ultimately induce the Spaniard to KKiss the Bey's hand Letter from Consul Pulis, dated Malta 16. ult. states that the
Emperor of Morocco has declared war against the U States - French
paDers announce the same - But having received no communications
from any of our Commanders these last sixty five days I still hope
this intelligence unfounded - If true I should expect circulars of
the fact.

To Secretary of State from William Baton, U. 8. Consul, Tunis

TUNISrt* Awg. 1809.
SIR, Since closing my dispatches of day before yesterday I have
received official information of the hostile menaces of the Emperor of
Morocco, and of Commodore Morris being detained in that quarter
to wait the result. In consequence of this Intelligence I have written
to Mahamet Bashaw and Consul Pulis, inclosures 1. & 2. - I t is
now become, in my view of our actual situation, more important than
ever to retain, if possible, this Bashaw in our interest; because if the
project with him succeed, it will defeat a t once those of his Brother
and the Emperor. - It was an unlucky circumstance that our good

228

NAT'AL OPERATIONS FROM 1802 TO 1803

friends the English set the Tripoline equipages of the ship and brig a t

Gib' on the Morocco coast - Not less so that they gave convoy to
the escape of Morad Rais - Have we still in Amema any body who
believes in English Magnamify!

Last spring this Bey peremptorily demanded my passports for his
merchant vessels to Tripoli. I as peremptorily refused - He ordered
me to quit the regency in the first American shlp which should appear I came to the right about; snd returning to my office, forbade my secretary filling any more passports for cruisers. The Bey's commercial
Agent soon appeared a t the Amp house; and begged, in God's name,
that I would retract from this resolution - I anmered, the Bey had
chosen his position - I had taken mine; which I should hold so long
as he persisted in his - This produced a message from the Bey for
me-to appear s t Bsrdo -I went -An Amnesty was agreed on -And
a discussion entered upon on the relative advantages and disadvantages
of peace and war - The minister acknowledged their inferiority of
fighting our ships of war - But, added, "You cannot do us any hurt.
T e will lay up our large ships and send out our small cruisers to distress your commerce - A fly in a man's throat, said he, though it
will not kill him, will make hun vomit. But, continued he, i t is not
our object to provoke a war by sending you away; we only want a
Consul of more accommodating disposition - more friendly to the
Barbary interests." That is to say, who will yield implicitly to all
their demands and receive gratuities in return.
When the Bey's demand for a sloop of war was in discussion, the
winter after my snival here; and when menace had failed, he sent R
renegsde to me with a tiskery, permit, to ship a thousand caffices
(14,000 bushls) of wheat - As tiskeries then sold this was worth little
less than ten thousand dollm - I had occasion for it, and, indeed,
had asked for i t on the terns of other purchasers. On receiving it I
asked the messenger the price? He said, his master had sent i t as
an ezpression of f&Rd6hip!
I returned it into his hands, with a cornliment of twelve dollars for his trouble, and told him to say to his
Raster that, We did not do business in that way. Consequence, the
Bey refused me the tiskery for payment - This circumstance produced the observation, I conjecture, a t Bardo last summer, when it was
proposed to offer me a consideration for passports to Tripoli, that
The English and Americans never took bribes. The postures I have
taken and held here, since the war, have kept me in continual perplexity and embarrassment. Why? I have been badly supported or rather not supported at all - I t is to be hoped this will not always
be the case - National Honor, interest, economy dictate otherwise Gentlemen late in command say I am too fast - Cap? Murray likewise. Perhaps i t is because they are too slow. A decisive blow must
be struck here - The interests, as the habits, of these States are the
same - And, notwithstanding any friendly professions they may utter
while a douceur still resk unliquidated on their tongue, they will
ultimately drop the mask, except restrained by an impression of fear.
It cannot but occur, that the issue of this war will serve as precedent
for ages. I am a too well wisher to present administration, apart the
interests of my country, not to hope that it will be honorable - This
is an expression which modesty, perhaps, should cherish and conceal But i t IS presumed my tedious communications are not for the criti-

SIR - Your Letter of the 6'p ins? I have received. To its contents,
I beg leave to reply, that I am well aware of the necessary consequences
of delay in mercantile pursuits. But I do conceive it just that the
property of Citizens of the United States lying in Malaga or this port,
have an equal claim to the protection of the Ships of War of that
Nation, as the property of the Americans now in Cadiz. M':
Simpson has been instructed to inform you from Tangier his opinion
of the danger American Vessels have to apprehend from the Corsairs
of Morocco - I must further observe, Sir, that the Ships of War under
my orders, are all full manned and it is not in my power to bear Supernumeraries particularly when supplies are Extravagant, and in fact,
Sir, it is impossible for me to have men on board who are destitute of cloathing, and in all probability from that circumstance will
generate dangerous diseases.

at Sea 50 Miles South of MALTA
Aug' 14th 1809
SIR The enclosed is what I had the Honor of communicating to
you, on the 30" Ul? l am now on my way to Malta for a temporary supply of Water, &
some other small stores, & am sorry to inform you that I was oblged
to leave Tripoli unguarded, the Sweds have all gone off, & no American
yet arrived, consequently shall be obliged to return &herewithout
delay, in hopes of h d h g the one, or other there, so as to permit my
going to Leghorn for further supplies, as I shall shortly be out of
every-thing. On the 318+U l t q we descryed t h e e sail of luge sbips standing in
for Tripoli, we were in high spirits, expecting them to be American
Frigates, we made Signals for them, but no reply being made, nor any
C o l o shewn,
~
tihat we coud observe, we brought too in their Van,
& prepared for their reception, soon after, we &[c1overed the Danish
Flag, & one of them with a broad Flag at the Mt head, as they did not
shew any inclination to bring boo, but pressing on with a croud of
d,
the Wind being light, I ordered my boat out7 & sent MF Stewart
(the 1.1 Lieu!) with orders to go on board the Flag Ship if posible,
he succeeded, when she brought too, with seeming reluctmee, he waa
instructed to find out whehher the were Frieates belonging to his
Danish Majesty, & where bound7 so, that Tripoli was under Blockade, & to make only such enquiries as might not be deemed improperJ
or disrespectfull, presuming that a Nation so tenacious of the rights,
& customs prevalent among Maritime Powers, as the Danes, woud
not violate those Usages by supplying an Enemy with any Articles
whatever, & as beneath the W t y of a Man of War; these were
questions I shoud have deem'd mpertinent myself, & therefore they
were not made & I h o w of no authority to stop Men of War from
going off an Enemies Port; whether they did give them supplies, or
not, I am ignormt, but they remained a t Anchor off the T o m twelve
Days when they came off in the night, with a still seeming intention to
avoid us, but we fell in with them a little before Midmght, & made
all the 4 they mud to avoid us, we gave chase, & at Day light
brought one of the Frigates too7 after firing twice for her, ~LI short,
their conduct hath been strange, & reserved to the last degree
We were infomed by the Captain that the Tripohes had not made
any further Capturea &m that of Ca Morris's Brig, and that he,
c% the other Pmoners were treatad wef, & that the Baahaw counted
upon a speedy Perm with us, he also informed us, that they h d
lately mnt out three small Galleya I have turnJd off a number of Merchant Vessels since 1 have been
on the station7 but the little Craft from Tunis will now, & then get
in, in deeance of me7 by rowing close under the land, & funishea
them with many supplies, & 1 am not satisfied in my mind that this
Blockade can answer any good purpose, for it is reported here, that i t
bath already involved us into difficulties with Morocco, & will probably with all the other Barba States, a very &ht pretence for War
is sfficient with them, they ave nothing to loose by it, we have
had we have confined ourselves to the prevention of mntmband

parties, & a t the same time we might have turned our attention more
to convoying our Vessels I shall take the libert of digressing further, respecting our situation
with all the Barba Jtates; America hath certainly shewn a very
laudable pride, & ignity, in her efforts to abolish the obnoxious
custom of paying Tribute, but unless the European Nations, cooperate
more generally with us, & abolish that narrow minded Policy, that
yet prevails with some of the most potent Powersl much better situated than we arel for keeping up perpetual Warfare with them, or
till they are brought to proper terms, it will be more prudent for us,
also, to submit to the Indignity, at the expence of our Pride, they
are not a Commercial People therefore we can make no impression

event of our success with Tripoli, you shall have the earliest information of. The delay of the Adams in America, and her long passage,
have prevented me from being there before. Early in June, two
small gallies evaded the vigilance of the Swedish and American ships
of war off Tripoli, and on the 20th carried the Brig Franklin into Algiers. At that time, I was compelled to watch the Tripoline ship at
Gibraltar, and the movements of the Emperor of Morocco, who has
been fitting out his ships and gallies since he dismissed the American
Consul. How long he may be friendly, is, in my mind, extremely
dwbtfd. His conduct latterly, has furnished grounds for suspecting
him of taking the advantage of our trade, when he finds a less force
at Gibraltar to oppose his corsairs. I shall leave the Adam to watch
the Tripoline ship, and have given Captain Campbell instructions, to
run into Tangier-Bay frequently, and to acquaint you immediately,
should he discover the Emperor to be hostile towards the Americans.
"I availed myself of the first opportunity of writing to Captain
Murray, directing to him at Malta, but have not heard from him since
I have been in these seas. I desired him, to send the Boston to Gibraltar; but as she is not arrived, and I have heard of her being at
Malta on the 10th July, I take it for granted, my letters have not been
received. I have left orders for Captain M'Niel (with Mr. Gavino)
to sail immediately from Gibraltar-Bay for Boston, should he have
left Malta before my arrival. The crew of the Chesapeak are healthy,
and the ship a much better sea-boat, since her ballast has been raised.
I am now only waiting for wind to get under way."

board the Constellation, who told me the had belong to the C;rloria
but that they had been turn'd off, & beg' me to take them on board
as they were Americans, which I did do without hesitation, nor did
I think it worth my while to make any further enquiries about them,
had your Captain made application for them, as belonging to his
Ship I shoud not have hesitated in givin them u , which he did not
do, but certainly two men short of her 8rew oug t not to have prevented any measures you thought proper to pursue, however I m g h t
have difFered with you regarding the whole process of the aZoria & our

Tunis

TUNIB,Aug. 1&h, 1802.
ABOUT the time the Bashaw of Tri oli had fixed his resolution t30
declare war against the United States, r. Cathcart, our Consul near
that Regency, suggested to me, that Mahamet Bashaw, brother of the
reigning Bashaw, to whom the subjects of that Regency were very
much attached, being the rightful sovereign and then in Tunis, having
been treacherously driven from the throne some years ago, might be
used as an instrument in the hands of the United States, to chastise
the temerity of the usurper, reestablish himself, and effect a cheap,
honorable, and permanent peace to our country. I immediately entered into a concertation with the exiled Bashaw to this effect: and he
gave me such assurances of the feasibility of the measure, together
with such collateral information collected from other quarters, as left
scarcely a doubt of its success, if managed with suitable address. Mr.
Cathcart suggested the same project to government, and I reported
to the proper department the steps I had taken in the measure. Last
winter, being in an infirm state of health from the convalescence of n
fever which had reduced me very low during the summer, I was ndvised by physicians to take a voyage a t sea. Accordingly I embarkccl
in the United States transport, the George U7ashington, on the 13th
December, for Leghorn. Late in February, information came to mc
that Mahamet Bashaw was about to return to Tripoli, on overtures
made to him by the reigning Bashaw; who, i t seems, had become
jealous of him in his actual situation. I immediately embarked for
Tunis, in a Danish built ship of mine, called the 6'Zoria, armed with
fourteen twelve and six pounders; navigated by thirty seven men,
chiefly Americans; and commanded by Capt Joseph Bounds of Baltimore; where, on my arrival, I found the Bashaw on the point of departure, under the escort of about forty Tripoline soldiers, for the
province of Derne in the Regency of Tripoli, the government of which
the usurper had romised him as an indemnity for the loss of his throne.
My return to $unis and arguments which I used, determined the
Bashaw to change his resolution, and seek some secure asylum until
the arrival of the American squadron. But the Bey of Tunis, whether
suspicious of what was on foot, or from what other motives I know not,
had refused him further supplies in his Regency. His departure therefore, had become a matter of necessity. I wished him to go to Leghorn and put himself into the hands of Mr. Cathcart: but, surrounded
with Turkish subjects of his brother, as he was, left i t not optional with
him: and, though apprehensive of treachery on the part of his brother,
he seemed to have no alternative but to submit to h s destiny. Yet he
expressed a desire by some means to be thrown into the hands of the
Americans. Here being none of our ships of war in the vicinity, I dispatched Capt. Bounds to the Boston frigate, Capt. M'Niell, being the
only commander on the coast, with a statement of facts; who embraced
the project and sent Capt. Bounds back to me with instructions to
hold the Gloria in service, a t my disposition, until the arrival of the

b

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS

241

Commodore. In the mean time, before the Bashaw sailed, I obtained secret intelligence from this Bey's Prime Minister that the object of the usurper was to get possession of his brother in order to dehim. I immediately communicated this intelligence to the
Bas aw, who had now alread embarked for his passage, and brought
him to a resolution to go to alta, and there wait the arrival of our
Commodore, with whom he might proceed before Tripoli and demand
the restitution of his Regency; as he had assurances that, in such case,
the subjects in general, who are much dissatisfied with the war, would
revolt in his favor and deliver the usurper into his hands. Accordingly, under a pretext of evading the Swede and American frigates, he
prevailed on k s attendants to touch at Malta. This plan being arranged, I ordered Capt. Bounds to Gibraltar, with dispatches to the
government and Commodore, stating this position of affairs. He
there fell in with the Consleuation, Captain Murray; who, after having
previously read my communications, and consulted with Captains S.
Barron and Bainbridge, discarded the project, and dismissed my ship
with marks of pointed disapprobation. Mahamet Bashaw, faithful
to his engagements, discharged his ship at Malta, under the same pretext which took him to that port; and has remained there ever since.
But, though he has had an interview with Capt. M'Niell who counselled him to persevere in the project, he has received no succour, nor
even countenance from the gentleman now in command (Capt. Murray.) The circumstance of his secure position, however, has excited
such alarm in the apprehensions of the reigning Bashaw, that he has
actually called to the defence of his city such of the Arabs of his kingdom as are attached to his interest, and, to insure their fidelity, confhed their chiefs within his walls. This fact, together with the solicitude of the usurper to get possession of his brother's person? go to
demonstrate the correctness of our calculations on this project, if
suitable advantage had been taken of the position it offered. I hope
the occasion is not lost.

I had a Battle the other Day with eight of their Gun Boats, &

destroyed them all, but they got so near the Fort of Tripoli, which
kept up a £ire upon us, that I W&S compelld to haul off, tho I did not
receive any injury from them, the information of our having killed
their men, I have from two of the Crew of the Brig Franklin, who
made their escape from thence, in a Greek Ship, now hero, they also
inform me that three others of the Crew, have been claimed by the
British Consul, as their Subjects, & delivered up to him, so that if
the information be true, we have but four left m Captivity, unless
there hath been some recent captures, which was not the case when I
left the station on the 12Q Inst, as I had intelligence from the Shore

VIRGINLA
August $81802.
SIR,Your letter of May 21. 1802 with a copy of thnt of July 2, 1802
has been duly received.
I hope that before the receipt of this you will have been successfully
engaged in making peace with Tripoli. The late conduct of the Emperor of Morocco, and the effect which may be produced on the
disposition of the Bey of Tunis by the rencounter reported t o have
happened between the Boston Frigate, and some of bs cruizers, add
fresh motives, at the same time that they embnrrass the means, for
putting an end to the War with Tripoli. To provide for any contingency to yourself, which might produce disappointment or delay,
Commodore Morris will be instructed, should the negotiation not be
over, to carry i t on himself if necessary;and as he will be in a manner the
centre of information, and will have a certain relation to all the
measures connected with our Mediterranean &airs, the President
thinks it proper, that the proceedings which may remain for the fulfillment of your instructions, should be concerted with him and receive
his sanction.
According to information given by Mr Eaton, he has prevailed on
the Brother of the Bashaw of Tripoli to repair to Malta, with a view
to be with our squadron before Tripoli, and to be made use of against
the Bashaw. At this distance it is difEcult to judge accurately of the
pro'ect, or to give particular instructions for the management of it.
Altbo' it does not accord with the general sentiments or ~ i e w of
s the
United States, to intermeddle with the domestic controversies of other
countries, it can not be unfair in the prosecution of a just War, or the
accomplishment of a reasonable eace, to take advantage of the hostile
cooperation of others. As far t erefore as the views of the Brother
may contribute to our success, the aid of them may be used for the
purpose. Should this aid be found inapplicable or his own personal
object unattainable, It wifl be due to the honor of the United States,
and to the expectations he will have naturally formed, to treat his
disappointment with much tenderness, and to restore him as nearly
as may be, to the situation from which he was drawn; or to make
some other convenient arrangement that may be more eligible to him.
In case of a treat of peace with the r u h g Bashaw of Tripoli, perhaps
it may be possib e to make some stipulation, formal or informal, in
favor of the Brother, which may be a desirable alleviation of his
misfortune.
This will be sent by the New York Frigate commanded by Captain
James Barren. She will reinforce our squadron in the Medzbmanmn
a t the same time that she conveys supplies for i t and $30,000 to be
offered to the De of Algiers in place of the Annuity of stores. She
also conregs to Aibraltar an hundred Gun carriages prep~redas a
compliment to the Emperor of Morocco before his hostility was
declared; and which i t is possible may now be usefully employed in
some stage of a reconciliation with him.

To Willism Eaton, U. 6. Consul, Tunis, from Secretary of State

"VIRGINIA,22d August, 180.2.
"SIR, Not having our last letters by me, I cannot refer to their
dates, nor particular y to their contents. The most important part
of them, communicated the plan concerted with the brother of the Bmlutw
of Tripoli,for making use of him against the latter, in favor of the
United States. Although i t does not accord with the general sentiments or views of the United States, to intermeddle in the domestic
contests of other countries, it cannot be unfair, in the prosecution of a
just war, or the accompIishment of a reasonable peace, to turn to their
advantage, the enmity and pretensions of others against a common
foe. How far success in the plan ought to be relied on, cannot be
decided a t this distance, and with so imperfect a knowledge of many
circumstances. The event, it is hoped, will correspond with your zeal
and with your cdcuIations. Should the rival brother be disappointed
in his object, it will be due to the honor of the United States, to treat his
misfortune with the utmost tenderness, and to restore hzm as nearly
as may he to the sitdim rom which h was dram, unless some other
proper arrangement sho d be more acceptable to him. This wish of
the President will be conveyed to Commodore Morris and Mr. Cathcart, with a suggestion, that in the event of peace with the ruling
Bashaw, an attempt should be made to insert some provision favorable
to his brother.
You are sufficiently aware of the motives to circumscribe expense,
as much as possible, in our Mediterranean transactions. I t is hoped
that no money will be re uired by the present occasion, nor is any
remitted to you for it. (?ommodore Morris will indeed have in b s
hands a fund of about 20,000 dollars, of which some part may be
spared to you, in case he be led to see the necessity of it, as an ingredient in the preservation of peace with Tunis. I trust however, that
your good management of other means, will render them sufficient
for the object."

you were informed of the intention of the President, to compliment
the Emperor with one hundred gun carriages, and that they would
probably be accom anied by a letter. Notwithstanding the hostile
declarations of the mperor, it is hoped that an advantage may flow
from your possessing these conciliating tokens of the esteem and good
will of the United States towards him. They are accordingly sent
by the New-York. How far it may be best, in case use can be made of
them, must be decided according to circumstances, of which yourself
and Commodore Morris can best judge. Should it be thought improper to make the tender of the carnages, or should the tender be
refused, Gibraltar will probably be the most convenient depository
for them under a pemssion, which no doubt will be given by the
proper authorit on a proper application.
Commodore &orris will receive for certain contingent purposes,
about 20,000 dollars. Should a part of this money be indispensibly
required in any of your conciliating measures, he will open the resource to you, on being satisfied with the occasion of resorting to it.
Your late draft for 1000 dollars will be honored. I have thought it
not amiss to forward a letter of February 27th, although written
with referrence to a state of things different from that presented in
the last communications, remarkmg only, that in case the question
should again arise on the request of the Emperor of Morocco, to
receive under his flag, the vessel left at Gibraltar by the Tripolines,
it is deemed proper by the President, that the permission should be
granted on reasonable appearances, that he has become the real
owner of the vessel, and that his flag is 11ot meant to protect the
return of the vessel to Tripoli.

FRIGATE
Bostm,

ALICANT,
August 22, 1802.
We, the subscribers, being a t the consular house of the United
States at Tunis, in March last, it was represented to us by the consul,
William Eaton, Esq., that the former and rightful sovereign of
Tripoli was then at Tunis, where he had been for several years,
having been about ten years before driven from his throne by the
Bashaw, his brother, who being now a t war with
present reig
the Swedes an Americans, he had become fearful of the overtures
which might be made to the cidevanl Bashaw by them, and in consequence had requested the Bashaw of Tunis to order him out of his
Regency, which was accordingly done. At the same time the reigning Bashaw offered his brother the government of Derne, in Tripoli,
if he would return, which offer was supposed by Mr. Eaton to have
been made with a view of getting him m his power.
Mr. Eaton then requested our opinions respecting getting the
cideoant Bashaw in our power, either by treaty and aa a friend, or,
should he persist in going to Tri oli, to endeavor to take him as an
?e according1 gave it as our opinion
enemy after his leaving port. I
that it would be a primary object with the nited States to get this
man in their power; that, having possession of him, an end might
very easily be put to the war, by taking him on board of one of our

ships, and ordering all our force before Tripoli, and there offering the
Bashaw, their former sovereign, to the people, which, if accepted,
peace might be made immed~ately,and on our own terms; or, on
their refusal, to batter down their fortifications.
In consequence of which Mr. Eaton had several interviews with
him, and made him offers of going on board some one of the American
men of war, or of going to Leghorn with a salary, until the arrival of
the commodore; which, however, was not accepted by the Bashaw,
who insisted on going to Tripoli, and that in a few days.
Mr. Eaton informed us of his last resolution, and that a Russian
ship was actually in port, ready for and waiting his going on board.
As there was no time to be lost, he again requested our advice on the
propriety of putting the GZoria, an armed ship of his own, then lying
in port ready for sea, into the service of the United States, and sending
her off immediately with despatches to Captain McNiell of the
Boston frigate, who was supposed to be either at Malta, or off Tripoli.
We gave i t as our opinion that i t would be highly proper not only to
put her into the service for this business, but even to keep her so for
the purpose of sending despatches, or to facilitate his escape from
T m s , should this business give umbrage to the Bashaw of that
Regency, kc.
At each of these conferences were also present Doctor William
Turner, surgeon of the frigate Philadelphia, and Captain Bounds, of
the armed ship G'Zoria, who also agreed with us in opinion.
The GZoria was accordingly sent off the next morning, and fell in
with Captain McNiell coming out of Malta, who highly approved of
what had been done, and gave Bounds, master of the Gloria, a warrant or commission until the arrival of the commodore.

To Secretary of State from William Eaton, U. 6. Consul, Tnnia

TUNIS,August 23d, 1802.

OUR operations of the last and present year produce nothing in

effect but additional enemies and national contempt. If the same
system of operations continue, so will the same consequences. The
obstinate posture and affected indifference to menace, which have
hitherto been my talismen in lieu of solid argument here, no longer
avail. The Minister puffs a whistle in my face, and says; "We find
i t is all a puff! We see how you carry on the war with Tripoli!"
I have never ceased to give the alarm in due season: to suggest
such measures as seemed to me indispensible to parry serious mischief;
and to point out what I beliered would be the consequence of neglecting that advice. I have now the melancholy reflection that my
apprehensions have been but too well founded, and my predictions
but too accurate.
My exile is become insupportable here. Abandoned by my countrymen m command ;no advice from government to regulate my conduct;
and m own exertions failing of effect; I am left subject, though not
yet su missive, to the most intolerable abuse and personal vexation.
h n i e t y , perplexity and a climate unfavorable to m constitution,
waste m health. The position I have taken and he1c r with this Bey
in regarcf to passports for his merchantmen for Tripoli, has excited a
temper and disposition in this court to distress me in my personal

t

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS

249

concerns. I have frequently stated that my salary is an inadequate
support. The check which Capt. Murray thought proper to put on
my public measures has not less affected my ublic character. Thus
situated, I am. consuming life, property, an$ perhaps, public reputation here, without the consoling prospect of having the merit of
being useful to my country. Why should I remain at a post which is
no longer tenable? Again, I repeat, my individual resources are insufficient barriers agamst the avarice of this Regency. From the
first moment of my agenc here i t was a parent to me that submission
to the demands of this ey would o y sharpen avidity. I stated
this apprehension in my communications to government: i t was
thought too limly! My measures to chastise a perfidious enemy are
now branded, by commanders, as spemdative; the effwions of a disordered fancy! Is i t not enough that I have sacrificed almost four
years to the service of my country in a state of painful sequestration
from all rational enjoyment? Wdl any body alledge that I have not
discharged my duty with an upright zeal? And we such the rewards
of my services? To be branded unheard in my own defence, and by
a sobtary Capt. of a frigate, with speczllation, and insanity! This IS
too much! I have the native rights, and I trust the feelings of nn
American citizen. Let Murray leave to me my liberty and my honor:
he may filch from me all the other appendages of life which can be
useful to him. But blasted as is my honor here by the weight of his
authority and the breath of his scandal, my very existence is insupportable. I t were impossible to keep these t h g s concealed here,
even if they had been transacted with less publicity. The Bey says;
"I always told the American Consul he was a mad man," (because I
have not been his obsequious slave, as are half the Consuls near him,)
"and i t appears the commanders of his nation are of the same opinion!"
Gentle commanders! Ye have hitherto exhibited no symptoms of
madness to these Regencies! They are perfectly satisfied with your
moderation! Equally so with the blast, in cool blood, you have
stamped on the character of a fellow citizen and a fellow servant of
your country.
I am constrained therefore, not less by a regard to the interest and
honor of my country than to my own individual interest and honor,
to request the President will permit me to resign the trust I have the
honor to hold under the government of the United States; unless more
active operations shall be resolved on against the enemy; in which
case it would gratify me to remain on thls coast till the rssue be determined.
P. S. Aug. %8.
Yesterday I was called to the palace. The Minister formally
demanded of me a frigate of 36 guns. I t need not be thought strange
to see me in America this winter. I can neither yield to nor get n d
of the demand.

LEGHORN
Augt %'5@1802

SIR During my residence a t Tripoli I had the honor to transmit
to the Department of State the history of the reign of Aly Pacha
father of the reigning sovereign of Tripoli including the different
revolutions in that State, an account of the murder of Mohammed
Bey & the dethroning of the rightfull sovereign of Tripoli Hamet Pacha
who a t that period was under the protection of the Bey of Tunis, but
is now a t Malta, & in a supplement I forwarded some account of the
accession to the throne & relgn of the present Usurper Jouseph Pacha
Caramanli From the day of my arrival I conceiv'd i t my duty to be particular
in forwarding details of the most prominent transactions of that
government for the information of the President & spared no pains
or expense to procure the best intsUigence obtainable, whether
eventually I succeeded or not I must leave to your candor to determine, which may be ascertain'd by comparing my communications
with the transactions which have since transpired - .As the above
mentioned papers as well as my own observation conmced me that
the inhabitants of Tripoli held the present Pacha in the greatest
degree of horror imaginable & of their great desire that Hamet who
was then a t Tunis should again assume the reigns of government, I
was left no reason to doubt that should he ever be able to appear before
Tripoli with any considerable force to espouse his cause, that the chief

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS

251

inhabitants of that Regency would declare in his favor, indeed so
sensible is Jouseph that b conduct neither merits nor will ever
receive their support when any force is opposed to him that when
ever he goes out of the cit he carries all IS treasure & jewels with
him in chests mounted on ules which are confided to the care of his
favorite slaves, who hsve orders to keep as close to him as possible,
nor is he ever accompanied by less than from three to five hundred
of his partizans who are composed of negroes & men of desperate
fortunes, who would espouse his cause no longer than until his treasure
was exhausted and would then file into the ranks of the best paymaster, for this reason he carry's his cash with him, as likewise to
enable him to raise a part among the Arabs, should ever his brothers
party assume courage s cient to shut the gates of the City against
him as he did agamt Hamet when he treacherously usurp'd the
Pachalic In m details of the relative situation of Tripoli with other Nations
ob-e
the many causes the Grand Senior has had to comyou
plain of the arrogance of Jouseph Pacha & no doubt will join with
me in opinion that the war in which he was engaged was the only
reason which prevented him from chastizing him as he deserv'd, &
that he on$ waits for a proper opportunity I believe is evident; no
act could be more just than the re-instatmg Hamet Pacha on the
throne of his forefathers, & no act could insure the Grand Signore
a revenge so prompt & efficacious & attended with so little expense
both of blood & treasure; nor so effectually insure the gratitude &
future obedience of Hamet & his family, as well as set a precedent
to the other statea of Barbary whose incorrigible insolence has become unsupportable at the sublime Port & render an example not
on. expedent but absolutely necessary &useph Pacha perfectly acquainted with these circumstances
spared no pains to entice his brother Hamet to come to Tripoli
under the s ecious pretext of giving him the government of the
rovinces of %
ernaI
& Bengasi; but mthout effect, Hamet would not
&sten to his proposal & demanded of his brother to give him up his
wife & children who he holds as hostages & to settle a small annuity
on him sufficient to maintain his family promising that he would
then live & die at Tunis.
In the above train were affairs a t Tripoli when I left it, & under
those impressions I was induced in m letter to Mr Eaton of the 15'Q
of June 1801 to make the following o servations "I conceive it peculiarly fortunate that Tri oli has broke with us
first, ss we have it in our power with-a small' force to reduce them
to our own terms & consequent1 to mfluence the other Regency's
in our favor, as they would 6

demonstration that we brook
not insults with im unity, nay Sir If the Pacha of Tripolis brother
Hamet who is at $'
unis was a man of understanding & enterprize I
would stake my soul that with the assistance of four of 09Elrigates
that I would effect a revolution in his favor and place hun on the
throne of Tripoli in spight of every obstacle & thereby insure the
United States the grahtude of him & his successors, besides concluding an advantageous peace" - but I must sincerely declare that
actuated as I was by no other motive than an honest zeal for what I
supposed & continue to suppose to be the best interest of my country,
I at that period thought it a moral impossibility that it would take
fifteen months to draw out the energy's of an injured nation, or tihat

252

motives of humanity would so far preponderate in our councils as to
induce us to postpone our vengeance until the barbarity of those
miscreants to our unfortunate fellow Citizens would give a latitude
& prescribe the rules of a ri orous retaliation In a letter of the 2gt@o June I forwarded to Mr Eaton the out
lines of my dispatch N? 8 dated a t Leghorn July 2* 1801 wherein I
requested him to ascertain how far said Hamet would be willing to
engage in an expedition of that nature, to which I received no
answer for many months, for particulars I refer you to the dis atch
Bi you will please to observe the Paragraph which commences "fpropose chastising them one a t a time & pursueing such measures a t
the Ottoman court as will effectually prevent any coalition taking
place injurious to our interests The measures in contemplation were to embark the said Eamet
onboard our Comodores ship, to proceed with him to Constantinople,
to present him to the grand Vizir & let him then make use of his
own arguments to procure the Caftan or Robe of honor, & while he
was negociating for force which the Grand Senior undoubtedly means
to send against Tripoli, we would have profited of the opportunity
to have concluded a commercial treaty with the sublime Port & to
have made such arrangements both there & with Hamet Pacha a s
could not fail to inspire those nations with sentiments favorable to
our dignity & interests, by procuring the Grand Senior's sanction to
this expedition would effectually prevent any coalition taking place
unfavorable to our interests, & that the Grand Senior still Intends
to revenge the insults he has receiv'd you will be inform'd by Mr
Nissens communications dated Tripoli April 22"d 1802 forwarded in
my dispatch N? 7 of this year No material alteration took place until March last when the Usurper
Jouse h Pacha having succeeded in persuading the Bey of Tunis to
deny
protection to his brother Hamet, he was obliged from mere
necessity to accede to Jouse h s proposal & actually accepted the
offer of the government of erna, & embark'd onboard a russian
ship bound to Malta (but supposed to have been bound to Derna)
where he arrived the 1lt@
of April This change of position by Hamet Pacha induced Mr Eaton to
take the measures which he no doubt has detail'd to government in
the amplest manner & which had not this event taken place so suddenly he would not have done until he receiv'd the Presidents instructions & so far as those measures have been made known to me
I must do Mt Eaton the justice to say that they seem to have been
judicious dictated by imperious necessity & an honest zeal for the
success of an enterprize which promised such vast advantages to
our Country Thus were we situated when the Constellation arrived in this sea,
when i t seems by Mr Eatons communications to me that C a p t W e x r
Murray arrogated to himself the presumption to discard measures the
the motives of which whether right or wrong he must have been
perfectly unac uainted with, na totally ignorant off, & which exclusive of his eing a junior o cer to Cap'" MqNiel, were b no
means in his department, & that too in a stile of the most illi eral
censure, without even observing the common respect due from public
OBcers in difft departments to each other es ecially in foreign ports:
the details of this transaction no doubt Mr aton has transmited to

-

govr who will decide with im artiality on the merits of the cause, as
I by no means conceive mys f entitled to so p a t a latitude, nor do
I wish to enter into any controversy on the occasion, m sole aim in
making this report is to request that the Resident will ge pleaa'd to
draw a line of distinction between the relative dutys of the Consuls
residing in Barbary & the Commanders of our vessels of War, for I
cant suppose it conductive to the public interesa to subject men
(who have spent the best parts of their lives in the public service &
who have been several yearn acquiring knowledge in the Country's
where they reside) to the caprice of every gentleman who may command our vessels of War, for altho they may be excellent seamen &
as good officers it must be supposed that they must be very deficient
in any superficial knowledge they may have acquired relative to
Barbary where they have scarce ever been, & even had their stay
been proportioned to the full extent of their penetration & wisdom,
from their want of Knowledge of the language & manners & customs
of the people, they would be able to obtain but little information
but what would derive from the Consul resident, whose measures if
they in the plenitude of their power think proper to discard & censure,
I presume we had much better stay at home than subject ourselves
to this additional degradation The situation of a Consul in Barbary provided he is determined to
do his duty is of all others the most humiliating & perilous, exiled
('tho honorably) from his dearest connections, doom'd to breath an
air contaminated by plague & slavery, subject even in our beds to
the mortal stings of scorpions, exposed to eveq species of insolence
& degradation that a fertile brain'd Mohammetan can invent to
render the life of a christian superlatively miserable, that dare oppose
his will, one moment menaced with chains, the next with death &
damnation, in a state of constant vigilance concern & perplexity;
their is no occasion nor necessity in addition to a11 our suffering of
subjecting our measures to the control of men, who from the routine
of their duty can have as little ability to judge either of their propriety or utdity as they have had modesty in censureing what they
wanted the power to condemn Captq Daniel MWiel has had several conferences with Hamet
Bashaw a t Malta & I believe in conjunction with the Swedish Admiral Cederstrom has made some arrangements with him the particulars of which are to me unknown, thus Sir ou are inform'd that
every officer acquainted with the subject, is o the same o inion on
the subject that I am, & none has opposed the measure ut those
totally unacquainted with its tendency, I therefore re uest that you
will represent the subject of this dispatch to the Presi ent in such a
manner that in future a line may be drawn between our relative
duty's, for it is evident that whether the measure is approved by
government or not, that the commanders of each of our vessels of
War, especially those acting under a senior officer has not power, or
ought ever to have power delegated to him sufficient to discard
measures of such vast importance, & if this act is sanctioned by
government it will in future be quoted as precedent, which would be
giving our Commanders a latitude productive of many irr
especially in so young a Navy as ours, & would likewise be e means
of en endaring animossity's where the greatest unammity & most
cordi concurence ought to exist -

SIR In addition to my dispatch of yestexday give me leave respectfully to submit to the Presidents decision- Whether, supposing
government should think proper to put an end to the War with Trip011
without prosecuting it to extremity ; it would not be to the interest of
the United States to embark Hamet Pacha on board our Comodores
Ship & proceed with him before Tripoli, to then inform his brother
Jouseph that our intentions were to conclude a permanent Treaty
with him provided he would agree upon tenns of reciprocity & mutual
convenience, that should he think proper to comply with the terms
which we would dictate, that on his giving his brother Hamet his
promise of perpetual protection & installing him with the rights &
~mmunity'sappertaining to the Beylic of Derna & Bengaisi according
to his promise, that we would land him & his suite a t Derna the seat
of his govern$- that otherwise we would make use of such means as
God had already placed in our hands, which join'd to our influence a t
the sublime Port, who were inform'd & well satisfied of the justness
of our cause, we made no doubt would enable us to seat the said Hamet
Pacha upon the Throne of his forefathers I presume from Jouseph Pachas present situation that he would
prescribe to any terms sooner than try the experiment & that we would
thereby be enabled to conclude a treaty upon honorable terms, which
to insure its continuance ought to be rescribed with moderation Enclosed is a copy of Mr Eatons etter to me of the 12'b of July

NAVYDEPT. 27 [or 281 Azd~wt1802.
Commodore MORRIS.- Mediterranean. From the tenour of the letters from the department of State herewith sent and left open for your inspection, you will perceive that you
are to have a superintending agency in the negotiations therein contemplated. You will, besides, herewith receive, to be retained by you,
copies of these letters and also of the instructions to Mr Cathcart
which had been transmitted by the Adams. These several dispatches
you will consider as instructions to you as well as to Mc Cathcart.
you will keep it in mind that it is the interest and the desire of the
United States to be at peace with all the world, and that it is expected
of you to contribute your utmost endeavours to effectuate without
delay an honorable accommod~tionwith Tripoli Morocco and any of
the other Barbary Powers with whom we may happen to be a t war.
And although the instructions to make peace have relation only to
Tripoli yet you will consider yourself hereb fully empowered to negotiate an adjustment of our differences wit Morocco or with an of
the other Barbary powers that may have declared or waged 6 a r
against us. And whenever Mr Cathcart shall be within a reasonable
distance you will not fail in giving him due notice and in calling him to
your assistance. In adjusting the terms of Peace with the Dey of
Tripoli, whatever regard may be had to the situation of his Brother,
it is not to be considered by you of sufficient magnitude to prevent or
even to retard a final settlement with the Dey. Mr Eton in this
affair cannot be considered an authorized agent of the Government. If circumstances should render it indispensibl necessary for you to
make peace with any of the B a r b q Powers wit out having tbe benefit of the advice and aid of Mr Cathcart, you will, as Commanding
Officer of the Squadron, be considered by the Emperor or by any of
the Bashaws as sufficiently empowered without the form of a special
Commission. I t has been reported that about the 1" June there had been an
engagement between Captain MFNeill and a Tunisian Squadron.
This Report, I am willing to persuade myself, is not correct. But if so
unpleasant an event has happened, the Ag essor merits punishment.
If the Aggression has proceeded from the unisian OfEcer, we trust,
it was not by the order of the Dey, and, in such case, we are willing to
leave the proceedings in consequence of i t in his own hands entirely.
And if our Officer has been the Aggressor he will be proceeded against
according to the Laws of our Country and every reparation will be
made which Justice and Honor shall require. The thirty thousand dollars for the Dey of Algiers and the twenty
thousand dollars for the other owers as explained in the dispatches of
the Secretary of State you w& employ agreeably to his instructions
and in paying over the same you will take such vouchers as will be
prescribed to you by the Treasury Department. As the Emperor of Morocco has declared War against the United
States without the least a pearance of Justice and as other of the
Barbary Powers may be in uced to do the same, it is the Command of
the President and you are hereby instructad to protect our Commerce
by all the means in your Power against the armed Vessels of any
Barbary State that may either declare or wnge War against us. The

Considering the varying aspects of our affairs in the Mediterranean
it would a t this distance be hghly improper to lay you under absolute
orders as to the precise disposition of your Squadron. You will therefore distribute them in such manner ss in your judgment will most
effectually &ord to our Commerce the proposed protection. But i t
will I trust, be in your power to emplo one of the frigates constantly
in convoying our Merchantmen from adiz and another in convoying
them from Malaga. And as Convo ed Vessels are liable to be dispersed in the Gut during Calms, the nterprize might there meet each
convoy for the purpose of keeping the Emperor's Boats in check. The General &eew had been put in Commission for the purpose of
conveying to you one hundred Gun Carriages @ be delivered to the
Emperor of Morocco as a present with an appropriate letter written by
the President himself. These testimonials of friendship have been
withheld in consequence of the unexpected declaration of War by the
Emperor. And instead of them have been substituted the two additional frigates, the New York and the John Adams. You will cordially co-operate with the Swedes and with every other
nation a t War with those Barbary Powers that ma have declared or
waged war against us. At the same time you wd cautiouslg avoid
whatever may have a tendency to bring us in collision m t h any
friendly State. Be pleased to accept assurances of my great regard and esteem. -

ready to contribute thereto as far as in my power, I did not hesitate at
again hoisting their Flag on my residence m Tangier, in testimony of
the return of Peace, and notified to His Excell? The President His
Majestys Friendly dispositions in this particular. - I also gave the
necessary information on the subject to the Commanding Officer of the
American Ships of War stationed in these Seas, and granted Passports
for His Majestys Frigate Mirboh, and Schooner Miribha, that they
might put to Sea & Navigate in safety. I beg you will have the goodness to represent these matters to His

experience from the Government of the United States, and their

ajesty may be pleased to shew, for maintaining an uninterupted
Peace between the two Nations. - At same time speaking with that

now the honour to acquaint you that after sending away NQ48, I
reflected it would be best delay writing the Minister again, untill after
departure of the Frigate, then general7 believed to be about to sail
from Larach; lest the Emperour disapo~ntedby the Resistance it was
natural I should make to his groundless pretensions, should recall the
order given the Captain for respecting the Ela of The United

for my Passport for that Ship, offered a farther en ucement for me not
to hazard grving Umbrage a t that moment; however the first Leiut
arrived from Larach on the 21" Ult?, when I delivered him the usual
Passport & they put to Sea on the 26"'; said to be destined to run as
far as the Canaries, and thence to the Coast of Cantabria to establish
their Cruize. - It now appears the Captain of the Frigate resisted

the order sent him by Alcayd Hashash on my arrival a t Tetuan, alledging that altho' he admitted he had authority for directing him to
take American Vessels, yet he doubted if once given if he could do
away that order; of consequence i t became necessary to apply to His
Majesty, on receipt of whose answer Captain Lubarez sent for my
Passport. - The Ship carrys 22 Guns & only 93 Men, part of the
Crew having been landed a t Larach Sick. With this I have the honour of transmiting copy of the Letter I
wrote the Minister on the ls.tInst. - I t will afford me much satisfaction, to know what I have said on subject of the Emperours pretension, meets the approbation of His Excell? The President. - I
have stated only facts, and thought but to reserve co y of m Letter
of the 18'' July 1195 to the then Minister, and that of &deY %limans
to The President on the 18'? August following, as Vouchers more
proper to be exhibited in support of my arguments, and in opposition to what farther may be alledged on the part of this Governmr on
subject of what they have thought fit to advance, rather than now. I confess I am almost a t a loss to assign any more probable reason for
that measure, than that either they are ignorant of what actualy passed
between the Minister and myself in 1795, and are desirous of comeing
a t such facts as we may be able to substantiate; or that they have
asserted an arrangement then took place such as they now wish to
establish, and by that finesse conceive they take a more plausible mode
for bringing i t forward, than a new pretension mould be. I n either case I shall conceive i t my duty to resist i t by every means
in my power, untill I shall be honoured with His Excell? The Presidents Commands on the occasion, which I persuade myself you will
have the goodness to transmit, in the most probable speedy Channel. The busyness of bringin the Tripoline Ship from Gibraltar under
the Emperours Flag, has een agam agitated, and a general application made by Alcayde Hashash to the Consuls here for Passports
for her as belonging to His Majesty, to sail from hence for Tripoly; I
positively refused mine in these terms, nor do I find any has been
granted; but it is certain Men are ordered from Tetuan for her, and
that she is to hoist the Emperour's Colours a t Gibraltar, so soon as the
Weather will allow these people to get over. - I have acquainted
CaptWampbell of the Adanzs Frigate, that in my private oppinion
the whole is a colodable busyness; but if the Emperour announces to
the Body of the Consuls that the Ship is his, and demands Passports
accordingly, merely to go to Sea, and Navigate as his, I realy do not
see how I dare venture to contest the matter; or from circumstances to
express doubts on what is stated by the Sovereign of the Country as a
fact, without runing a great risque of drawing serrious resentment on
the Commerce of The United States. - At this trying moment I pray
His Excell? The President will be perfectly assured my best exertions
shall be called forth for the good of the Service I have the honour of
being entrusted with; but I cannot help repeating that nothing can
give me such aid as a Naval force being seen on the Coast, or known
to be in the Neighborhood, for that alone is the terror of these people. Altho' I would gladly hope matters may yet be accommodated, yet
lest the Emperour should persist in the demands he has a t last brought
forward, which I conclude will not be granted him, I would beg with
due submission to recommend that the Commanding Officer of the
Ships of War of the United States in these Seas, be instructed to act

%

266

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1802 TO 1803

with energy ainst this Country, but especialy against its Cruizers,
so soon as the mperour shall repeat his late hostile conduct in sending
your Consul from hence, or by any other means authorise a violation
of the Peace now subsisting. - A h t grand point in War against
this Country, is to be extremely carefullto prevent their Cruizers being
sent to Sea, for as they seldom go out in quest of but one Nation, he
who blocks up their Ports, is considered to fight the Battles of all; and
are accordingly feared or res ted, which appear to have become
- On my te return to this Country, finding the
was certainly destined to act against us, I earnestly
entreated Commodore Morris to send one of the Ships under hw
Command to watch her; I was so confident he would do so, I ventured
to say he had, which certainly had a good effect for it was general
believed, as fortunately a fresh Gale a t East daily presented ~ e s s e 6
beating in sight of the Port. -

dated 225' in which he informs me, that the Emperor had claim'd the
Tripolitan Ship a t this place as his Property, & Men were order'd
to proceed to Gibraltar from Tetuan for the purpose of hoisting his
Flag on board said Ship, fit her out, & take her to the above Port, or
Tangier's Bay; from thence proceed to Tripoli: That Passports had
been demanded of him & other Consuls a t Tangiers, for the Ship to
leave Gibraltar, which were refus'd - I wrote him for Answer, as
follows - "Sir - With Respect to the Emperor's pretentions to the
Tripolean Ship, I have only to observe, that unless they are accompanied with Vouchers sufficient to prove her his property, I am
determined to prevent her leaving this place, nor can any thmg less
than your Passport alter my Determination" On the 5th Inst I receiv'd another Letter from M' Simpson dated
the 4t@,in which he mentions that things remain'd 'ust as they were,
except, that Men were absolutely order'd to Gibra tar for the aforesaid purpose; That he had written to the Emperor for further Explanation respecting the Ship, to which, he had not then receiv'd
any Answer - The Wind is now Westerly, & expect to hear from him
in the Course of Twenty four Hours. - The Emperor has been
punctual to his Word, on the Evening of the 1" Inst thirty Moors
arriv'd here, Among them are two Tripolenes One of whom commanded the Tripolean Brig, that was stop'd here with the Ship, the
other a Subordinate Officer
Yesterday they commenc'd the Outfits of the Ship, which will take
them a t least twelve or fourteen Days, to prepare her for the Short
run from here to Tetuan. - I wrote Mr Simpson on the 5Q urging
the Necessity of coming to a better Understanding with the Emperor
respecting the Ship; likewise imfonn'd him that a Crew had arriv'd
from Tetuan, & was in the Act of repairing her; That without he
granted her a passport, I am by Duty & Inclination compell'd to
detain her; in doing which I see inevitable War. - That the Emperor is desirous of going to War with us, is my firm belief, & this he
thinks the most feasable lan for accomplishing his Wishes - He
wants Money & ere long wi 1demand it.
Among other Misfortunes attending the Adams, we have found
our Mizenmast very rotten, and have been oblig'd to make it almost
new - Also from Rocks, & foul Ground in Anchoring, I find one of
our Cables so materially damag'd, that we shall be oblig'd to purchase a new one, before the Winter sets in I have also found it necessary to send home, by the Boston Frigate,

[Translation]

TUNIS,September 8, 1802.
Mr. PRESIDENT:
With equal pleasure and satisfaction I have seen
arrive, and have received successively, all the military and naval
stores, as well as the superb jewels, which your Government has sent
forward for my Regency and myself, in execution of our conditions for
the confirming and consolidating the harmony and alliance which,
thank God, have been established, and actually subsist between us.
While I am happy to give you this assprance, indeed sincere, of my
full contentment, I ought not to dissemble that I do not, at the same
time, see myself treated with the same distinctmion,and the same
regard that you have had for your other friends; m d since I am
equally one, I avow to you, with frankness, as I have already declared
to Mr. Eaton, your consul, that it would have been infinitely agreeable to me if you had also made me a present of a vessel of war.
Mr. Eaton, not finding it convenient to charge himself with the
communication of this demand to you on my part, I am determined
to testify to you directly, by the present, that lt would be very agreeable to me that you should send me a good frigate of 36 guns, which
would add to the high esteem I have for your nation, and would more
and more cement the ties of our friendship, which on my part I shall
maintain firm and inviolable.
Convinced as I am, beforehand, Mr. President, that this demand,
taken into consideration, will obtain the full effect which I expect
from it, I renew to you the assurance of my most distinguished
esteem; and I pray Almighty God to have you m his holy keeping.

SIR This letter will be a mere repitition of my last, as nothing has
transpired since, worthy of notice except, the pleasing prospect of
our being able shortly, to leave this wretched Hole, where we have
not experienced one pleasant scence since our being stationd here,
except what has been produced within ourselves, - but I hav'nt told
you our pleasing prospects yet, and shall commence by sa-,
that
the Emperor of hlorocco has made a demand of the Ship, whch we
have been blockading, - as his property and has actually hoisted the
Moorish flag on board, - The S h p is now fitting with all possible
expedition for Sea, - This is a piece of Conduct on the part of the
Emperor, which is not fully understood but enerally beleived that it
is done in order to have some pretext for a eclarahon of Hostilities,
as he must be convinced that as Soon as She is out of the limited
distance from the Bay, that She will be sent back again by the A
h
whose orders I understand, is to prevent her laving this place, all
this will happen I believe, but a commencement of Hostilities with the
Moors is certainly to be dreaded, for beyond doubt they have i t in
their Power to do more injury to the U. States, than all the Barbary
Powers together, those excepted,
My Detachment is in perfect health, and in as good plite as the
nature of the case will admit.

272

XAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1802 TO 1805

to speak the Consul, being a t the Goulette, I answered the signal from
the Gloria and embarked in her boat to go on board - but before T
reached the frigate she filled and stood out to sea. I saw her boat pass
alongside the french Admiral; and finding i t impossible to come up
with her, I went on board the Adm! where I received the letter of which
Enclosure A. is a copy - and from which it will appear that the coast of
Tripoli is now totally abandoned by our ships of war. Thus ends the
expedition of 1802! - I am in opinion with Captain Murray, that to
keep up the blockade, in the manner it has been kept up, is of no avail.
But to abandon the coast a t discretion seems to be going farther discretionarily than the Captains former cautious movements would lead
us to expect from him - The circumstance however furnishes additional evidence of the accuracy of my uniform opinion that, our present
mode of warfare i s not sufficiently energetic. The idea of "giving security to our trade by freequent convoy" will be found as unavailing as
the blockade. Our merchantmen, impatient of long delay, will
hazard themselves a t sea; and the enemy, finding no impediment
before his port, will become more enterprizing - But if this mode of
protecting our commerce should be found, in some measure, to avail,
it8 expence must increase in proportion to the increase of our commercial adventurers and the number of our enemy and its duration
would be infinite. Would i t not be more safe and less expensive to
buy a peace and a t once subscribe to tribute a t the discretion of these
piratical chiefs than to rely on this precarious mode of defending
against their outrage? But are the Government and people of the
U States prepared for this abasement! On the St* 3 oclock p. m. The ConsteUation again appeared, and hove
to in the road of the Goulette - signal as before to speak the Consul Assured that she would not come to anchor - and fearing that the
delay of going to the palace for the Bey's emission to go on board
(no Consul can pass the Castle of the Gou ette without it) might exhaust her patience, I hastened to the Goulette, bribed the Commandant of the Castle, and pushed off for the frigate - met her boat
with an Officer about cannon shot from the shore - found she wanted
nothing particular of me - and returned and passed the night with
the Danish Consul a t his garden on the ruins of Carthage - Next
morning a t daybreak, to cover the corruption of the commandant of
the castle, sent my Dragoman to the palace to ask the Bey's emnission to go on board - He sent the tiskery with this message "$ell the
American Consul I will not suffer the ships of war of his nation to
cruise in my harbor - If they enter here they shall anchor, their
commanders come ashore, according to custom let me know their
object and their wants - and pay me and the neutrality of my port
the respect due to a sovereign!"
I returned the message 'Tell the Bey I pledge my personal responsibility for the observance, on the part of our commanders, of the
neutrality of his port. And when he will pay our shi s of war the same
be responsible
respect as those of other nations in amity I will
that the civilities shall be reciprocated - But so long as he refuses
the u a d salute to our Bag, and withholds the customary present of
provisions to our ships of war, as has hitherto been the case, if he
expects gratuitous compliments he must be disap ointed. I would
take care never to invite another Commander on s ore until I should
have assurance that he would receive the distinctions usually shown
those of other sovereign powers in friendship with him - I n the

mean time our ships of war would cruise on bis coast and look into his
orts whenever circumstanoes rendered it expedient. If he wished to
L o n their object, i t was their enemy (there was then an enemy
cruiser in port) and as to their mnts I wished he would not suffer h
feelings to be too much interested about them - But if he felt himself hurt a t not receiving the usual national respect from them, I would
enter with him, in person, into a discussion on the subject whenever
he was disposed to do it on principles of reciprocity. * * *

NAT7AL OPERATIONS FROM 1802 TO 1803

Refering you to my last respects of the 220 Augt, after Cruizing
again off Tripoli for some time, & meeting with a heavy Blow in
which I found no small dificulty in beating off the Coast, & finding
it of no avail to remain there any longer, I resolved to make s short
Cluize of[fl Cape Bon, off which place I fell in with the Swedish
Admiral, & communicated to him the substance of my interview with
the Bashaw of Tripoli, he acceeds to the plan which I have given him,
but agrees with me that it is now too late in the Season to put it into
execut,ion, & thinks to have an additional force with Bomb Ketches
& Gun boats, to cooperate in the month of May next, before which
time the season w i l l not be farourable, he hath again gone to keep
up the Blockade a short time longer, & then means to turn his whole
attention to Convoys in coo eration with our Ships, & advises me to
proceed to Naples, 8: to co ect all the Swedish, & Americans, from
thence Westerly to Gibralter, & to return with such Vessels as are
bound up the Streights, which is the plan I had previously adopted,
for the Tripolitan Galleys are now out, four sad'd about the 20th
Ult? & two were on the eve of departure which I have been on the
look out for, off Cape Bon the only place we can have a chance of
meeting with them, for such is the nature of the Coast of Barbary that
they have Ports, $ protection every thirty or forty hliles in the whole
extent, & they never get from under cover of the Land till they run
over to the European Coast for a dash, to the place they mean to
try their fortune, & so well are they disguised that 'twill be hard to
discriminate between them, & the Cruizers of Algiers, & Tunis, they
all wear Red Colours, & can buy, or enter into collusions with the
Galleys of those Regencies to procure the Pasports of our Consuls
with facility, the Vessels are of the same discription, $ nothing can
discover them but an act of Captureing our Vessels, or Prisoners on
board, thus you will percieve the dificulty of our situation, & unless
we War with all, we can't but be deceived, so well aware of the advantages that those States hare over Civilized, or well organized Governments, that Policy dictates the surer, tho not the most dignified,
custom of paying Tribute, or given douceurs, which I believe every
Nation in Europe doth, 'tho a t this time the French Republic hath a
squadron of two Ships of the line, a Frigate, & Corvette at Tunis,
which are acting upon proper grounds, & make Peece upon their
terms, they make a great parade, & are striving for a monopolizement
of the Mediterranean Commerce, for the Seas are now covered with
their Vessels, how then, situated as we are, can we expect to stand
almost alone in this Warfare, Sweden will soon make peace, or I am
much mistaken; as I now expect to see or hear from Capt Morris
soon, I refer you to him for future occurrences. I came here to get some repairs to my rudder, & shall leave this in
a few Days with Convoy for Leghorn $ 9 $ 9 I have very great attention paid me by the Prime Minister Gent

Sep. l S t Q 1801.
To HIS EXCELLENCY
The Bashaw of Tripoli Since the commencement of the unprofitable war which unhappily
yet continues between your Excellency and the U States, it has pleased
the Alrmghty that but a few prisoners have been made on neither
side - Yet it c m o t but occur to your EX?that, last year, a number
of your Exn subjects and soldiers fell into the hands of the American
Commodore, for whom your EX?was pleased to agree to the exchange
of six Americans - The fortune of war has this summer thrown four
American citizens into the hands of one of your Ex? cruisers, who
have arrived at Tripoli - We cannot consider this accident as a
great misfortune, because it furnishes an op ortunity of demonstrating to the American government the full reEance they may place on
the good faith and magnanimity of your EXTin regarding and sacredly
fu[l]filling all promises voluntarily made - We will not doubt therefore that the Americans are ahead set a t liberty in faith of that
agreement; or, if they are still a t ripoli, that your Ex? does consider them as free citizens of the U States, and not as prisoners of war;
as, placing full reliance on your Ex?'stiskerg we do also consider them.
T h s being their situation, it would be convenient that Cap. Morris
should be provisionally charged with the sffairs of the U States near
your Ex7 until an accommodation shall be happily effectuated between the two governments. This provision has now become necessary as the Danish Ambassador to your ExP' has not found it convenient to ermit the Consul General of his nation to be any longer
charged wit% the American affairs The Algerine Jew, Azulai, at this place, has asserted in this Consulate, that the Dey of Algiers has ordered your Ex7 to give up the
Americans, and that your EX?dare not disobey the order. But as
we remember your EXPcomplained of the intervention of that Dey
uz our treaty of peace and made that circumstance a subject of
grievance and an argument for annulling that treat we cannot
pleasing to
suppose the Dey's interference in the present case can
your EXT:We believe it would suit better both the independence of
your Ex" character and the inhresta of the parties that all our
ne ociations should be direct and without the intervention of any
ot er power.
We cannot but repeat the full reliance we have in your Exy:'
just
sense of national honor and good faith to stipulations, and that we
shall realize the full effectof this confidence in finding that our citizens
are free, and that your Excellency will consent that Captain Morris
may be charged mth the &aim of the U States near your EX?until

regard to what you say on what I told you in m former Letter, respecting our comeing once in every two years, L o w i n g you to be a

to have come and presented yourself to Our Master (whom God
reserve) and to have accommodated that which has been deranged,
your delay for the space of eight years since you made the Peace,
without any of you ap earing here. - Had that met His Majestys

your Treaties of Peace, they might have been treated upon and
answers would have been given to your pretensions. - But you still
bear in mind that word, which has no meaning. - In truth any other

is manifested that my Mediation is always employed to do good, all this is for the Friendship I bear you. By my sincerity - By God and by my Law, I have no view of

da of August - the Business has however been postponed considerab y and I have reason to believe that a second more pressing and peremptory message arrived from the Dey the lQtQ
inst, as the Day after
the Cap: unexpectedly was informd by Leon Farfara, but the Bashaw
had given him and his crew their liberty and was sending them to
Algiers. Many circumstances coincides in persuading me of this;
they endeavourd to keep secret the arrival of the courier - I have
the Bashaws Tesquere still in my hands, I don't hear that he means to
demand it.
My next letter shall contain the accounts of what I have furnished
the American Prisoners with and their other expences Captain Morris
has given me a recipt for 100 Dollars, the amount of what he has
receiv'd in money & Cloathes; a t the moment of h.w departure he got
about 20 Dollars more to defray some expences; for this sum he could
not give any receipt it being a t the time of embarking. He Intends
to go to Merseilles from Algiers and I shall write to him to send you his
receipt. The expences of the Sailors are not much above 100 Dollars,
which said accompts I will forward to you by my next Captain
Morris is very desirous of a conversation with you Sir, may be he
goes to Leghorn several Persons here not your friends have been

To Bis Excellency Sidi Mohamet Ben Absalem Selawy, Secretary of State of the

SIR,- I have received the letter your wrote me, in answer to that

I also gave the necessary information on the sybject to the commanding officer of the American ships of war, stationed in these seas,
and anted passports for his majesty's frigate Mirbohu, and schooner
~ir!!hu, that they might put to sea and navigate in safety.
I beg you will have the goodness to represent these matters to his
imperial majesty, with an assurance from me that he w$ always
experience from the government of the United States, a,nd thawagents,
an equal readiness to correspond with-every dlspositlon hls majesty
may be pleased to shew, for maintaming an unktempted peace
between the two nations. At same tune speakmg mth that smcenty
[which] ought to guide the representatives of nations, I cannot help
expressing to you with what surprise and concern I observe the
farther communication you make me by order of his imperial majesty,
stating his expectation of annual embassies accompanied with presents

284

NAVAL OPERATIONS FBOM 1803 TO 1803

from the United Ststes of America. - You are pleased to say it was
so stipulated with the late Sid Mohamet Ben Ottoman.
I beg you will tell me where, and by whom such engagement was
made, for I am a perfect stranger to it.
What I know of the matter is, that in the year 1795, when I had the
honour of being sent by the government of the United States to his
imperial majesty Muley Soliman at Rhabat, for the purpose of congratulating him on his happy accession to the throne of h~ ancestors,
and for obtaining a recognition of the treaty made a t Morocco,
between his majesty's father Sidy Mohamet Ben Abdallah and tho
United States of America, his majesty was pleased to ratify that
treaty, without any addition or alteration; in fulfilment of his father's
engagement, made in the name of the Almighty, that it should continue in full force for fifty years from the first day of Rhamaden in
the year 1200, on which it was signed.
His majesty's letter on that occasion to the President of the United
States, bearing date the 2d of Zafar 1210, was delivered to me by
Sid Mohamet Ben Ottoman, and declared that his majesty was at
peace, tranquillity and friendship with America, in the same manner
as his father (who is with God) was, to which the government of the
United States have ever faithfully corresponded.
By that treaty, there is no stipulation whatever for embassies being
sent, or presents made by either the one government or the other,
as you will see by the copy of it in Arabic. I delivered it to Sid
Mohamet Ben Ottoman, on the 12th July, 1795, at Rhabat. I have
seen it my duty to transmit to the government, I have the honour to
represent in this count , three several copies of your letter on this
important subject, by ifferent conveyances, to guard against n~iscarriages; and I wait to receive such orders as his excellency the
President shall see fit to give me on the occasion.
I have lately received information that two seamen, part of the
crew of the American ship [Omego]stranded three years ago 13 April
18001 near Capc! Nun have escaped from the Arabs, and are now with
the governour of Tamdaunt. I have to request you will have the
goodness to transmit me a letter to that gentleman, directing him to
allow these unfortunate peo le to proceed to Mogadore, in order that
my agent there Mr. Peter uyer, may send t.hem to their own country. Alcayde kashash having signified to me his majesty's wish to
be provided with some more American rice, 1have given the necessary
directions to the consul at Gibraltar to send me a supply, so soon as
he can get any of a qua1it.y proper for his majesty's use.
It will at all times afford me particular pleasure to obey such
commands from his majesty.
I avail of this o p p o r t u t y of renewing my assurances of respect,
and beg you will be persuaded, I am, &c.

those I had the honour of transmitting copy of my Letter to the
Minister dated the b t of this Month. I have now the pleasure of sending translation of the answer he
has given, which tho' ffought with extraneous matter, the essence of
i t amounts to a confession, that they have not been able to offer any
thing farther, in support of the claims they had attempted to set
up. - I t will no doubt appear strange to you, that he now denies
having written the former Letter by His Majestys Command, such
inconsistencies are not unfrequent with those Gentlemen; on the
present occasion the contradiction being favourable to us, we shall
the more readily excuse him.I t is now evident to me that the sole drift of the Letter of the 6t9
August was to find out what we had to offer against their pretensions,
and I fully hope they have met me so well prepared for them, that
they will not readily come forward again with such. - Its my infention to be ve concise in my answer to the Minister, but I conceive
it will be hig y proper to transmit to him a copy of Muley S o h m
Ratification of the Treaty made with his Father, for I much doubt
if they have it, and also in order that he may see it is not a word
spoken by His Majesty "we bear in mind" but his formal Act under
His Imperial Seal. I shall likewise set him to rights with respect to his Idea of no
attentions having been paid the Emperour for eight years, whereas
it is Iittle more than half that time since I delivered him a Present at
Ilequinez in the name of the United States. By my Nq 35 you m i l l see the late Bashaw Hackmaw had been
taught to think so, which to me taken with the present assertion,
proves how little his Majestys present Ministers are acquaintedwith
what passed during Ben Ottomans Administration.
Sidy Mohamet Slawy pretends having rendered essential service,
that perhaps ma not have been precisely the case, but I am satisfied
be might have one us harp. - On such occasions lt is not less necessary to shew our generosity in this Country to the Minister, than to
reward actual services done; notwithstmd~ng all his disinterested
professions, I can see he expects a Present, and to secure a continuance
of his Freindship i t must be given. - His Ma'estys Orders for the
two Men a t Tarudsunt being sent u to ~ o g a d o rand permitted to
embark there, has been received 61

September 18021 I have found myself under the necessity of granting,
or take the consequence of the only alternative, that of contssting
what His Majesty assserted; this I fully hope His Excall? The h i dant will be satisfied is a matter I could not attempt without hazard-

ing the Emperour's severest Resentment, and without the most distant hope of bettering the busyness, as he certainly would not be
brought to retract what he has so solemnly said. - Yesterday I
transmitted CaptWampbell of the Adams copies of these papers for
his guidance, in case he should not see cause to attach that degree of
Credence to the Emperour's declaration my situation appeared to
compell me to yield it. - In conse uence of some disturbances in the
Neighborhood of Morocco His ajesty intends setting out from
Mequinez for that City in a few days, with a considerable Body of
Troops. - Mr Gavino sent me an Express Boat on Saturday with
advice of the approach of the New York Frigate with the Gun Carriages, under an Idea that early intelligence on that subject might
have been interesting.

SIR I n the communications which I had the Honor to hand you

this day on your arrival, you mill observe that Commodore Dale
had made an arrangrnent m t h the Bashaw of Tripoli for the exchange
of prisoners captured by him, and delivered up to said Bashaw on
his giving his obligation to deliver three American seamen in lieu of
21 turkish soldiers, and an American officer of equal rank, for the
turkish officer, who commanded them, should he capture ang, for
the particulars of said agreement, I refer ou to Commodore ale's
correspondence with Mr Nissen, and the ashaw's certificate under
the great seal of that Regency
By Mr Nissen's letter to me of the 8" of July and my answer of
the 3 1 ? 9 f August you will be informed that the Bashaw was a t that
eriod, d i s p o d to enter into a negociation, with any Agent of the
nited States for the re-establishment of peace; but a t the same time,
that he expected the proposal to be made by us, - he did not give
the most distant idea of the terms he would except, no doubt supposing
that our proposals would bear some proportion to his former demands;
and that, I refused positively to enter lnto any negociahon with him
untill he fulfilled his agreement with Commodore Dale and Liberated
Captg Andrew Morris and three of his-Crew.

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS

The instructions which I had the honor to receive from the President this da b you justses my having refused to make any proposal to the as{aw for he being the agressor, any overture must and
ought of right to proceed immediately from him. I am likewise
confirmed in my opinion that could a peace be obtained for five thousand dollars i t would be as contrary to our interests, as repugnant to
our feelings, to pay i t for any other purpose, than merely as a Consular present, on the establishment of a Consul, and not even then
if i t could ossibly be avoided The inte8igence received this day of the hostile intentions of the
Emperor of Morocco, the capture of the two Swedish vessels by the
Tripolitans joined to the advanced Season of the year, convinces me
of the propriety of your ideas - "That i t would be as imprudent to
draw our force, from the Straights mouth before something is concluded with that Empire, as i t would be to permit our merchant
vessels to go down unprotected, exclusive of the Constellation's rudder
hly improper to risque
being so much out of repair as renders it
her on an enemies coast, m any season ; much ess in this ;consequent1y
i t is utterly impossible to shew any more force before Tripoli in the
present Crisis, than the Chesapeake, and nothing decisive can possibly be effected before May or June next.
I now, Sir, take the liberty to quote my opinion on the steps which
I presume are most likely to promote the interests of the U States on
a supposition that only one Frigate, can be employ'd before Tripoly
a t present.
I conceive Sir, that i t would be conducive to our interests to proceed immediately to Tunis to obtain intelligence as well as to convince
that Government, that we were alert and viewed them with a suspicious regard; to then proceed before Tripoli, and hoist a Signal for
the Danish Consul to come off to us and peremptorily demand a
compliance with the arran ement made with Commodore Dale, as
a preliminary which must %e complied with before we could think
of even listning to any proposal of accommodation, and to signify
in a proper manner that if the Bashclw would hoist a fiag of truce;
that we would answer it as in similar cases and commence a negociation, thus would the Bashaw make the proposal without wounding
his pride, and we, would maintain our dignity and have an opportunity of sounding his Roads close in to the Rocks; as I am convinced
there is water enough for our Frigates to bring their broad-sides to
bear on the town at little more than a distance of half gun shot and
with little or no risque provided a favourable o ortunit is embraced should our negotiation prove abortive; I am ewwe o opinion,
that if the appearance of our frigates drawn in a line and approaching
the Cit did not obtain us all we could wish, that ten Shot lodged
in the Bashaw's castle, would insure us a peace for a Century or a t
least during his life; these, Sir, are my Sentiments; I speak from a
dear bought experience, and happy shall I be if the correspond
with yours; and I farther declare that no prime with J r i oli or any
other of the Barbary states will be permanent until1 the ic fea that we
sue for peace; through impressions of fear for our commercial interests
are totally eradicated and until1 those states are impressed with a
decided dread of our arms; in other respects we must be guided by
circumstances, but i t is absolutely necessary that our opperations
should be characterized by their energy - I am ready to embark nt

a moments warning and arrogate the Honor to subscribe myself with
the most cordial concurrence and esteem P S, Notwithstanding that, I am of opinion that our Frigates could
lay the Bashaw's castle in ruins, yet I certainly should prefer purchasing three or four small vessels to serve as bombketches and gunboats occasionally, for should one of our Frigates be dismasted i t
would cost more to refit her than the loss on the purchase of those
vessels besides keeping so large a number of men inactive for two
months a t least: Any communications of importance that you

SIRI am informed by our Consul (Mr Appleton) that the Gen! of
the French Division a t Leghorn, hath made a demand on him for a
French Citizen, that he asserts is detained on board this Ship, (this
Man I presume is the Drummer) as you are charged with the terms of
engagement entered into between the Marine Corps & the U. States, I
request you to call on Mr Appleton, that a full explination may take
place on this business In the first place you will convince him that he is not a French
Citizen, but a Switzer that he was taken on board a French Privateer
Cruizing on the American Coast, that the said Privateer had actually
made Prizes of two American Vesseh, previous to her Capture, & had
American Citizens then on board Prisoners, a sufficient proof that the
French Republic was a t War a t that period with U. States, or in other
words, the Privateer must be considered as a Pirate You will also assure M' Appleton that this man was not compelled
into the Service, nor is there any Law, or President [precedent] that
Authorises the compelling any Person to serve the U. States, against
their own free will, & that this said Drummer, did enter with his own
free will, & had made himself a Citizen of the U. St'ates, as such we
have since known him, & as such we intend to discharge him in due
time, you will then observe to Mr Appleton the dangerous conseuences that might ensue, upon a Sailor, or a Marine, belonging to any
&overnment refuseing to do his duty, (which this man hath done) to
be suffered to pass with impunity, & however well disposed I might be,
to give him his discharge, yet as a Commander in the U. States Service,
I do not think myself justifiable in complying with any compulsive
measures or demands (especially when illy founded) from any Person

LEGHORN
15th October 1802
SIRI profit by the first occasion to inform you of the Death of One
of your Officers (Ca t. M°Knight) who fell yesterday in a duel with
L! Lawson of the onsteUatwn. The uarrel took place some time
a o, when Ca t M°Knight sent him a hallenge, (at the same time
p acing himse f entirely a t the discretion of his Second) hlr Lawson
accepted the Challen e on conditions that the distance should be
Three Paces, which apt. MkKnights second would not agree to,
saying that he thought him an Assassin for proposing so short a distance, and that he was a coward; it remained quiet until1 we arrived
here, when Lt Lawson sent a Paper on board of us to be shewn to the
Officers, wherein he says that he had proved the famous Duellist a
coward, and mentions many more aggravating circumstances.
On Capt M%ni ht asking my opinion I candidly told him I did
not think the worl wq conceive M' Lawson a coward, neither could
they think him so as he had passed his word of Honour to his Second
to accede to any thing he thought proper, and that had I been his
Second I would not let him fight a t that distance for two reasons;
first that I never could justify m self for b r i n e g my friend to a
certain Death, and Secondly, that should not U e to run the risk of

being hanged and censured by the world. He then left me and went
on board his own Ship where they unfortunately renewed the Quarrel,
and aggravated each other to the highest pitch when they consented
to fight at the distance of Six Paces with a Brace of Pistols and advance and should both fail then to take Cutlasses. Capt M°Knight
received the Ball directly through the Center of his heart he had but
time to say he was shot and expired. I was not on the ground but
was with him immediately after. We had him conveyed to the
American Hotel but the laws of the place obliged us to convey him to
a Vault near the Burial ground that the Coroner might sit over him,
and where I was witness to a scene I shall ever remember, that of
being obliged to see a Brother Officers heart cut out, that I might
certify that the Ball had passed through the center of it, but the
laws (they told me) were not yet fully executed, that the Ball must
be found to be produced to the Court, I remonstrated with them for
some time, and even threatened to make a corpse of the Surgeon
should I prove that he was cutting up my friend for the experience
of his Students, to recollect that he had died a brave and honourable
man, and not a Culprit; they all a h e d in one voice that it was the
law of the land, I left them u to their Armpitts in blood. We interred him this morning atten ed by as many of the OfEcers from the
Ships as could be spared, but neither of the Commanders would
attend; nor would the let me fire over him; he is deposited in the
English Burial groun8where there are a great number of elegant
monuments, among which is that of the famous Smollet, I proposed
to the Officers of raising a small one over Capt. McKnight which they
readily agreed to, and I have now the funds in my hands for that
purpose which will raise a very handsome one. I t will no doubt be a
gratification to his Children and relat~ionsto know the spot where
his remains are deposited, and I presume they will not refuse the
gratification to the OEcers in takmg this method of shewing their
respect for him. I must observe, as a proof of his coolness, that previous to his going on the ground he left directions for his funeral (in
case he proved unfortunate) that it might be with as little expence as
possible, and that he should be buried with the Cloaths he had on.
16th, Misfortunes, they say, come together and this last one has
made me miserable, as I was innocently the cause of it, altho this
accident has confirmed me in my predestinarian principles, yet I
can't but lament that I should be made the instrument in the loss of
One of the most promissing young Men in the Navy (Mr Innis) with
three Sailors all of the Enterprize, I will endeavour to relate to you
the combination of circumstances that took place to accomplish this
misfortune.
I had accepted an invitation to dine with Mr Amory, a t 2 OClock
a t an ordinary, where in general they are very punctual, but this day
we did not sit down to Dinner 'till past Three, when I was informed our
Boat was on shore, I told the Officer that as I had not dined I would
not detain the Boat, but get a passage off in some of the other Ships
Boats. At 4 I went down with the Officers of the Constellation with
an intention of getting a w a g e with Capt. Murray; when we got on
the Quay I found there apt. Sterett waiting for two of his Sailors,
and as I was better acquainted with him than Capt. Murray I took a
passage with him, (Not considering that our Ship lay much further
out than the Enterprise, and that the wind waa blowing very hard off

shore,) when we had pushed off from the shore the two Sailors came
down and by jumping across several Boats, they got into the Boat,
Capt. Sterett did not intend to return for them, but to punish them
for leaving the boat. Those two men were drpwned, when we gotalongside the Enterprise, One of the Men complamed of being very slck, he
was taken out and another put in his place, who was One of the Four
saved, and what is more singular, the one that swam alongside of the
Constellation and gave information of the accident. By the active
exertions of the Officers of that Ship, they picked up three more of
the Sailors a t a great distance from each other, which was owing to
the darkness of the night, that the knew not which way to direct
their course The Sailor who left t e Boat last informs, that Davis
(if I am correct in that worthy Tar's name) who was one of the best
swimmers swore he would not leave the Midshipman (as he could not
swim) but perish with his Officer, who i t appears was not only beloved
by his Superiors in command, but even by those whom he commanded, Had he been one of our own Midshipmen, I should have
thought he was more in the line of his duty, and regretted his loss less,
it was not more than ten minutes after he had put me on board that
the Accident happened. I wish not to stain b s memory even with
im rudence, but I most heartily wish he had taken the advice of a
So dier for once, and not put more sail on the boat -.she was very
near upsetting when he haul'd aft the Foresheet m laymg her alongside our Ship, but he assured me he h e w the boat, and that there was
no danger.

a convoy from that place and Malaga. Our passage was extremely
prolonged by calms and easterly winds. My having received official
information of there being three Tripoline corsairs cruising in the
Mediterranean, induced me to take the Enterprize with me for the
purpose, in case of falling in with them, to have her aid with sweeps.
It is impossible a frigate can have any chance of capturing those
cruisers m moderate weather: they generally cruise close in with the
land, and make use of oars to get lnto shoal water, or some port.
I have dispatched Captain Murray in the Constellation, which
has received considerable damage in the rudder-irons, to Toulon, to
have it secured, and then to go to Gibraltar. His instructions, which
I have the honor herewith to enclose, will explain my reasons for
sending him to that place. I am informed by Captain Murray, who
has had recent information from Tripoli, that provisions are cheap
and plenty, especially the article of bread. Under these circumstances
and knowing the immense injury the commerce of the United States
would receive from a war with Morocco, I have authorized Captain
Murray to instruct Mr. Simpson, our Consul, to grant passports to
vessels bound to Tripoli, laden with wheat.
As soon as the ships of war arrive a t Malta, which, you will perceive, I have ordered up, and the bowsprit of the Chesapeak (which is
rotten) is sufficiently fished, which can be done much before the arrival
of the frigates from Gibraltar, I shall proceed before Tripoli, and with
Mr. Cathcart, make every possible effort to effect a peace.
Our having had a passage of 55 days, together with the delays I
met with, in bringing matters about with Morocco, and the advanced
period of the season when the Adams arrived in the Streights, has
made i t so late,as to render i t impossible to appear off Tripoli before
January. Indeed, the months of November and December are considered as unsafe to risk a ship on that coast. Ca tain Murray is
entirely out of provisions, and has ex ended the who e sum of money
he had on board, except 4 or 500 do ars, which has deprived me of
any funds from him. This circumstance will oblige me to draw for
three thousand dollars, on the navy de artment, the only bills that
can be negociated, without a considerab e loss; and bills are drawn a t
a great loss on London, a t Malta.
Your favor of the 13th August, I beg leave to acknowledge; it
came to my hands on my arrival. I regret the frigate Boston sailed
for America, before i t reached me. It would have been a fortunate

P

circumstance, to have retained her in these seas. I am fully persuaded, that a fomidable force is the only means by which peace can be
rocured with Tripoli, or hostilities prevented with the rest of the Barbary
Sowem.
I am extremely pleased with your intentions of sending out the
New-York. You may rest assured, Sir, that every exertion on my
part shall be made, to place the United States on friendly terms with
these powers, and in the event of war, that all possible means shall
be used to preserve the dignity of our nation, and protect the commerce
of our country. I beg leave to suggest for your consideration, the
necessity, in case of war continuing, of having small vessels, such as
the Enterprize; they are su£Eicient in strength to take the galliots and
gallies, and are the only class of vessels we are in the use of, that can
take the advantage of sweeps, and approach the land with safety.
I do not believe that gun-boats can be procured here; every nation
who are a t peace with the Barbary Powers, are so desirous of preserving that state, that they are afraid to sell vessels to act against them,
from the fear of giving umbrage, and involvhg themselves in war."

TUNIS.
16 Oct. 1809
To Com- MORRIS.
SIR, I learn the departure of your Squadron from Cagliari on tho
28'b ult. supposed for Leghorn - A report is in circulation here that
a negociation of peace between the United States and the Bashaw of
Tripoli is going on a t Algiers; but I am totally ignorant of its foundation, or whether it is by the authority of the Government, not
having r e d any advice from hpme since Oct. last. I t is certain however that our prisoners are liberated from Tripoli, and that Cap"
Morris is gone to Algiers, accompanied with a schaux (envoy) with a
view of effectuating a pacification. The Bashaw has long since
manifested a desire of an accommodation with US.,. actuated by a
wish to manage the Swedes alone and to relieve hunself from his
apprehensions of danger from his brother's late position - What
influence the intire change of that position will have on his future
arrangements time will unfold - But I am decidedly of opinion that
good policy would dictate that no negociation should be entered upon
with so faithless a character until he shall first have received an

298

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1806 TO 1803

impression of terror from the energy of our arms; above all things
that Algiers should not be resorted to as a mediator between the
parties - Is it forgotten that the Bashaw made the interference of
that Dey in our establishment of a peace his sole pretext for violating
the treaty? Or can i t be so soon overlooked that the Dey refused his
interference when called upon to inforce his guarantee of that treaty?
It is hardly to be supposed that the Gov. of the U States, once deceived,
would again expose themselves to a second insult on the same ground Hence I conclude that the present interference of that Regency is
unsolicited; a project of the Jews to get an ascendancy in our affairs
in all these Regencies: a project which they have assiduously and
perseveringly labored to effect ever since the U States have been
h o w n here as a nation - a project calculated to keep us in perpetual
embroils with the other regencies, a t the same time that it destroys
the idea of our national independence a t Algiers, and imposes on US
an imaginary obligation there which is thought never to be s d c i e n t l y
compensated - Whatever may be the pacrfic temper of our Government and Country experiment has already demonstrated that nothing
will render our nation respectable here and secure the faith of treaties
but a decided dread of our resentment. If we let the present occasion
to stamp that im ression pass over we establish a precedent for ages,
and posterity wilf)have reason to upbraid us of a weak and a yielding
policy. As a cit.ken of the United States I am for breaking the yoke
of slavery and of vassalage here - And I wish the present age may
have the merit of it.
I know we have some politicians among us who talk of reliance on
the magnanimity of the great powers of Europe to interfere in our
behalf - When the lion and the lamb shaU lie down together this event
will take place; but while jarring interests agitate this world and while
the greater powers of Europe are actuated by a counting-house
policy, in stead of relying on their magnanimity we must think of
defending ourselves against their intrigue here - If the US. had
possessed no commerc~alenterprize the immence treasures of Algiers
would not have lain so long secure in the vaults of their palaces. No!
Bonaptarte would long since have penetrated those mines. If there
were no Barbary States England and France would erect them But if we substitute tribute and regalia instead of solid argument to
parry the effects of this policy the revenue of our Country would not
be adequate to the exactions of these regencies - apart the abasement
of the concession I should have been extremely happy to have waited on you in this
port - Have commu~icationsto make to you which cannot be
trusted to a legible character and with which you ought to be made
ac uainted pass through your care a letter to the Depf of State - the receipt
of which and mode of conveyance please to advise me of by the
earliest occasion ((Went forward by a Danish merchantman via Leghorn - Oct. 18.

of last evening, prevented my receiving the answer that I expected,
& occasions me, to trouble ou a second time You may probably reco ect that after ordering me out of your

day, I repeated my request that I might be no longer cons~der[ed]on
duty, which I understood to be granted, & also that you a t the same
[time] ordered me below as if arrested. After this I did not suppose
that you could have considered these words of my note - the restrictions that you prescribe me in my present situation - to ask for a
detail of duty -my meaning was, that you might inform me, whether
you considered your expressions to go to the same point that I did
& if so, what were to be the restrictions during my arrest - & to
know whether I'm allowed to go upon the quarter deck or not There is one circumstance mentioned in your note that has been
misrepresented to you, where you say, that, after hearing your orders
for shortenin sail, I applied to the pllot - I aver that I did not heard
you order saif to be taken in.
You remark Sir respecting the treatment you are to receive, I
consider equally unprovoked & unnecessary The duty I owe myself
will always dictate to me, a res ectful deportment to my commander

SIBIt is with great sorrow that I have to inform you of the unfortunate affair that lately took place between two of our Officers, Cap!
McKnight & Mr Lawson our Second Lieut, the former gave the
challange, they fought a t six paces, both fired s t the same instant.
C a p M q l h g h t was shot through the heart and died instantaneously,
M'Lawson was not hurt,MrJones our 4 Lieut was second to the former,
& Mr Porter of the Chesapeake to the survivor. I knew nothing of
the &air till i t was made public in the ship. This melancholy event
took place here on the morning of the 14t@inst both parties behaved
with great firmnew & presence of mind. I am sorry that the uafortunata business terminated fatally, we were always friendly and on
good terms. but fate has given him what the world calls and honorable
death, which cannot now be helped. He was buried the day after
his decease with all the respect that the Officers of the Squadron could
shew him - Their dispute did not originate from, or infer to any
thing relating to the Corps. but ss private gentlemen. - While I
regret with the keenest sorrow this melancholy event I have to inform
you of another equally as much so. Last evening a boat belonging
to the Enterprize was upset while returning from the Chesapeake.
the wind being very strong off shore, the sea high, and the ni ht dark
it was miraculous that a single man was saved, but provi entially
one of her crew a good s w e r , after two hours exertions made our
Ship and gave us information of his unfortunate companions, our
boats were immediately sent in search of them and by uncommon exertions in a dark tempestuous night found 3 more flaating on the
benches and oars who are now perfectly recovered, the boat could

been drowned, as it is impossible they could survive till morning. I have taken charge of the Detachment and public cloathing, the
private property of Cape MgKnight is under the care of M: Spence
our Purser, he had a Pay Roll signed and witnessed up to Sept
1802, and an other began, signed by two or three to the last of Dec?
both of which are considered as private property and of course in
possession of the Purser, whom he requested to take charge of every
thing belonging to him. - C a p W u r r a y has given Roland the Drummer his discharge which leaves my detachment without music, it i s
true his time like a number of others, was expired, but I think like
the others he ought have been retained till our return to America The Detachment though reduced to 40 is in fine order, and I think
equal to an I have seen since I left home. - We sail to morrow for
Toulon & tfarseilles where we shall get some little repairs, then
make the best of our [way] for Gibraltar and Tangier, from which
ace I shall not fail to write you. Present my respects to Mrs. &

of June 17t@and 26. - Those since received are of Augt 12Q inclosing
the Letter to you from the Emperors Minister and of Sepr 3 d inclosing
your answer to that letter. Your return to your Consular station under the circumstances
which led to it, is entirely approved by the President. - I t was proper
both as it secured a temporary state of peace at a critical moment, and
as it facilitates the use of other means for effecting a permanent reconciliation. - The President approves also your opposition to the claim
of periodical presents, which your own recollection and the papers in
pour hands will best enable you to dis rove. - The Interest which
the United States have in maintaining eace on admissible terms with
the Barbary Powers being particularly applicable to Morrocco, we
calculate on all the exertions which you promise, for re-establishing on
a solid basis the good understandin with the Emperor. With this
view you will keep him sensible of t e friendly dispositions of the U
States, and of thelr respect for the good faith heretofore observed by
him. - The commercial Interest which Morrocco has in avoiding
War with a Nation possessing the faculties of the U States, is another
consideration which you ma probably touch on with advantage. Should money, or its equiva ent, be found an indispensable Agent in
fixing the Emperors dmposition to Peace, .you already know that
Commodore Morris has a small fund, on whch you may draw.
Be as sparing of expense however, as possible; both from a regard
to oconomy, and to the policy of keeping down the hopes and pretensions of these mercenary powers. - In no event you are to exceed
20,000 dollars; nor to go as far as that sum, unless it shall produce a
firm peace and an express or tacit relinquishment of the claim set up to
presents a t stated periods, which are another name only, for tribute.The United States must judge for themselves how far, and on what
occasions presents may be a proper testimony of their respect for the
faithfull and friendly conduct of the Emperor; and even of small
presents re-dated by this motive, you will not countenance expectation if it can be avoided. - The 100 Gun Carria es which were kept
back in consequence of the Emperors hostile dec aration, will be forwarded as soon as a proper conveyance can be found. The Frigates New York and John Adams, will probably be in the
Mediterranean before this reaches you. - The force which will be
kept in that Sea, will depend on the state of our affaira with the Coast
of Barbary, and particularly with Morocco. - For this as well as

The Sapatap demands of me a gold-mounted double-barrelled

The following is an extract of a letter from Bryan MqDonough,
charge of &airs of H: B: Majesty a t Tripoli to Henry Clark, charge of
aff? a t Tunis dated 6th inst.
"We have had a french frigate and brig a few days ago to confirm their
peace with this regency
The Bashaw received large presents from them,
amounting in value to a t least forty thousand dollars - And, what is considered of greater value, a beautiful cruiser mounting eighteen guns; sent
ss a present from Bonaparte to the Bashaw.
The Swedes have settled their &airs with this regency: but the poor
captives must remain until the money comes, which is ~tipulatedfor three
months: their frigate aailed for Leghorn the 24 instent" (The peace wes
obtained through the intervention of the French Ernbsssador. Thus
ended the d i t i o n of the north! Thus ends the alliance between Sweden
and the U Stateal)
The American Captain and his crew wss sent some time ago to Algiers - And I have reason to believe their affairs will soon be settled
through the mediation of that Government."

Far from receiving any succour from the magnanimity of the great

nations of Europe, we have now demonstrations of their policy to
use these instruments of piracy as impediments to the growth of our
commerce. Why does Bonaparte, a t this peculiar crisis, give Tri oli
a cruiser? Why has England assisted the escape of the ~ r i ~ o k e
admiral and his soldiers? The object is so clear that the regencies
themselves cannot but ercieve it: and it encourages their insolence.
They have formed an i ea that the U States are too far off to coerce
them - and the operations of our force have hitherto but confirmed
them in this security -

The indignities I have sufFered at this court latterly are insupportable - On the first appearance of our squadron this Bey behaved
respectfully: he has grown insolent in proportion to the moderation
of their movements and the success of the enimy - I have in no

without more energetic support I cannot maintam the position T
have taken here: a position which has hitherto received the approbation of every distinguished officer of the General Government with
whom I have had the honor to comes ond. - And, suffer me to add,
if further concessions are to be made ere I desire that I may not be

having lain ten days in Cagliari, only eighteen hours sail from this,

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1808 TO 1803

I am indeed weary of this state of exile & fruitless exertion - do
not however permit myself to consider any privation of personal
enjoyment (though on my part it is tOt81) as a S ~ C I - ~ C Bif, i t may go
to promote the honor and aid the interest of my beloved Country But let me be supported or replaced - it is a proposition equally
reasonable as desirable.
P. S. OCT.234 This morning Azulai, the AI eriue Jew, announces
to me the arrival of the American captives a t giere - The information comes to him by express - I receive no letters!
OCT.24. I learn this morning the conditions of $he Swedish
peace - 150,000 dollars prompt payment; 8,000 Consular present and 8,000 annual tribute - And Sweden is now to thank Frnnce for
her MediatuUn! - "VaVidis!"
The french Commissary General tells me, "The Swedish Admiral
acknowledges that the mediation of the french Embassador a t Tripoli
has saved his nation a hundred thousand doUars!" He might have
added - Bul the national honor and independence of Swehn are thrown
into the scale to balance the obligation!
NB. Last summer a small Tunisine coaster, from the island of
Gerbi, attempting to enter Tripoli with corn and oil, fell in with the
Swede. The Admiral confined the crew below, and put a Baron and
ten men on board to conduct the prize to Malta for ad'udication:
but, instead of Malta, they made Derne Head - The obleman,
not knowing where he was, called up his prisoners and asked "What
land? to whom belonging? & in whose possessionf" The Tunisines
answered - "Dt"m;belo71g2ng to &phi!; and in the possession of the
English!" - He put into port - was siezed - and sent prisoner to
Tripoli. - The Bashaw rendered the vessel and cargo to the proprietors in compliment to the Be of Tunis -This Bey, nofwithstanding,
reclaims of the Swede vease , cargo and indemnit for detention And states in his invoice $fly thousand Spanish do1Tars, which he says
were concealed under ballast for purchasing negro slaves a t Tripoli making an amount of about 75,000 dollars. Six months allowed for
ent - The Alternative, War!
as Captain Murray uninformed of the Swedish Baron's disaster
when he proposed to carry Mahamet Bashaw tQ Derne?

one, when laid u , and the lessening the Expence of
pm3
perpetu y necessary whd'e the Vessels lie in the water, are
objecb of the first importance to a nation which to a certain degree

repairs
Of
the

must be maritime. The dry Docks of Europe, being below the level
of tide water, are very expensive in their construction and in the
manner of keeping them clear of water, and are only practicable a t all
where they have h tides: insomuch that no nation has ever proposed
to lay up her who e navy in dry Docks - but if the dry dock were
above the level of the tide water, & there be any means of raisimg the
Vessels up into them, and of covering the Dock with a roof, thus withdrawn from the wet and sun they would last aa long as the interior
Timbers, doors and floors of a House - the vast command of running
water a t this place, a t Merent heights from 30 to 200 feet above the
tide water, enables us to effect this desirable object by forming a lower
Bason, into which the tide water shall float the vessel and then have
its gates closed, and adjoining to this, but 24 feet higher, an upper
bason 175 feet wide and 800 f. long (suflicient to contain 12 frigates)
into which running water can be introduced from above, so that filling
both basons (as in a lock) the Vessel shall be raised up and floated into
the upper one, and the water being discharged leave her dry - over a
bason not wider than 175 Feet, a roof can be thrown, in the manner
of that of the H& du ble a t Paris, which needing no underworks to
support it, will permit the Bason to be entirely open and free for the
movement of the vessels. I mean to propose the construction of one
of these to the national legislature, convinced that it will be a work of
no great cost, that it will save us a eat annual expence, and be an
encouragement to prepare in peace t e Vessels we shall need in war,
when we find they can be kept in a state of perfect preservation and
without expence The first thing to be done is to chuse from which of the Streams we
will derive our water for the lock, there are the Eastern Branch,
Tyber, Rock Creek and the Potomak itself - then to trace the Canal,
draw plans of that and of the two basons, and calculate the expence
of the whole, that we may lead the legislature .to no expence, in the
execution of which they shall not be apprized m the begblng. for
this I ask your aid which will require your coming here. Some
Surveys and levelings have been already made by Mr N. King a very
accurate man in that line, and who will assist in any thing you desire,
and execute on the Ground any Tracings you may direct, unless you
refer doing them yourself - It 1s very m a t e d too that this should
ge done immediately, as we have but little more than 4 weeks to the
meeting of the l+slature and there will be then but 3 weeks for them to
consider and decide before the day arrives (Jan 1) at which alone any
number of labourers can be hired here. Sho d that pass either the
work must lie over for a Year or be executed by day labourers a t double
expence. I pro ose that such a force shall be rovided as to compleat
the work in one ear. if this Succeeds as it w l i receive all our resent
ships, the next work will be a second one, to b@d and lay up &$tionel
ships. On the subject of your Su mtm

their Meetings, are not made public, of Course I cannot represent
against it, but I shall, do every thing in my Power to have it revoked,

adopted in a great measure thro' I orance, be carried into effect, it
will prove very prejudicial to our rade, in the Mediterranean, and
particularly as it would be imprudent for Vessels to proceed a loft,
without convoy.
I learn by Letters from Gibraltar under date of the 4 Inst, that the
Governor of Tangier, had demanded of the American, and Swedish
Consul, a Passport for the Tripoline, now Moorish Ship, so long
blocked up in that Bay, to proceed for Tripoly, this having been
refused, orders were immediately passed to Gibraltar, for to return
the Emperor of Morocco's Pass to that Ship and the Certificates
furnished by the foreign Consuls, residing in his Dominions, which
has been done, and the Vessel again laid up, untill the Emperor
should determine on the Subject, I sincere1 hope this Circumstance
may not Occasion fresh desturbances with orocco. B last advices from Leghorn, I find Commodore Morris had only
reac ed that Port on the 12 UltQ- With the Convoy, under his
Protection, The Schooner Enterprize was immediately after, despatched
with another Convoy, and had arrived at Barcelona on her Way down

The Government of the United States, not having the wishes of his
Excellency Sidi Hamet Caramanli made known, prevlous to my leaving
the United States, did not give me powers to engage m so ~mportant
an undertaking. But at the same tune, I make no doubt, lf you will
communicate with the American Government, detailing the specific
sum that may be wantod, and the robability of success that will
attend .the undertaking, with the a vantages that will arise to the
United statea in case of success, that they will instruct me to coo erate with his excellency, Sidi Hamet Caramanli, which I will
c eerfully obey. Any communication you wish to make on the subject,
I will forward by the first opportunity.

We have a squadron of ships in the meditemanean a t present under

you have been good Enou h to render i t your assistance on several
occasions for which you
be pleased to accept my thank^
The appointment of a navy agent in each port in the mediterranean
frequented by our ships of war is considered as unnecessary and inexpedient - in proportion as we multiply our agents we increase the
di£Eculties in the adjustment of our accounts These considerations have hitherto restrained my appointing more
agents than were indispensibly necessary - From representations,
however, lately made to me, I feel a persuasion that the appointment
of a navy agent for the ports of marseilles and Toulon would promote
the public Interest - and feeling highly confident of your Integrity
and Zed it affords me pleasure to offer that appointment to you, and
as your Jurisdiction as Consul for the United States extends to both
these Ports, I presume i t will not be inconvenient to yo11 to attend to
our Vessels arriving in either I have deposited a Credit with Messr?Degen & Purviance, on whom
you will draw for any supplies you may furnish our Ships Pour
drafts for thls purpose must be Countersigned by the commanding

after persevering, to et to Gibralter, till I sprung m fore mast, &
fore yard, & expend3 the last of my Bread to one J a y allowance,
having been for some Days previous, a t half a pound a Day, & seeing
no prospect of a change of Winds, 'tho in sight of the Rock, I was
compelled to stand for this place, & was received into the Mole to
get my Mast repaired which I shall have to hoist out to get fished &
will probably detain me here a Month, I coud not be in a better
place for the purpose, & hope i t will not be attended with a great
expence as I have a good Carpenters Crew of my own on board, who
have since I left America Caulked every seam in the Ship from the
Water edge upwards inside, & out, & the Ship is in h e condition in
all respects but as to the Mast & Yard, I have a spare yard a t Gibralter to replace this one, which will carry us there; a t this Season of
the Year we wreck & tare our Ships to little purpose by being a t Sea,
for the Barbary Powers seldom ever keep their Cruizers out in the
Winter Months, but as soon as my repairs are done I shall proceed to
Gibralter take m a supply of Provisions and return back to my old
station, if required I was charged with some instructions from Caps Morris respecting Morocco, which I by express sent on to Cap' Campbell to have
put in execution, it being uncertain when a Sea conveyance will offer I must beg leave to observe to you that I think i t woud be a great
savin to the Government, if instead of incumbering our Ships with
such arge quantities of Bread, which takes up so much room that a
due proportion of Flour might be sent over & above three Months
store for present use, we can have the Flour landed here or a t Malta
& get good fresh Bread Baked out of it a t little expence & no waste,
consequently more salt Provisions might be taken on board, & less
Water than usual so that each Ship coud ca
a t least eight Months
Provisions, & Stores, for the having of extraTbres deporyted a t Gibralter, is little better than having them in America, so very precarious, & uncertain are our passages up & down the Mediterranean, for an
extent of near 1500 Miles to the Coast of Tripoli
I have one more observation to make as respecting the ConsteUutwn,
previous to our departure from America, the Department was advised
of the bad state of her Decks, & some of her Beems, as well as the
Copper on her Bottom, i t will be re uisite that some provision shoud
be made for her against her arriva , if her services shoud a am be
re uired, & altho l t may have a selfish view, yet, I sm incEn-ed to
&eve
ou will find there is no port of Amenca, where a Ship can
be so we repaired, & a t so reasonable a rate as Phil*
I parted with the Enterprize with her Convoy from Leghorn & Barcelona, but I fear they have been dispersed or drove into some Port,
the last time I saw them was off Majorca in a heavy gale -

sent over two Officers to take charge of her who (both being of equal
Rank) claimed the Superiority & Occasioned a scuf3e which ended in
nothing more serious than the discharge of the crew & dismantling the

MALTA
Novr 26t4 1802
SIR Being apprized that the Bashaw of Tripoli, has made a merit
of giving up C a p t u n d r e w Morris, his Mate, Carpenter, Steward
and a Sailor, by the Mediation of Algiers, thereby placing the United
States under imaginary Obligations to that Regency, I take the
liberty to inform you, that Commodore Dale, had made an arrangement with the Bashaw of Tripoli for the Exchange of prisoners and
had actually delivered twenty one turkish Soldiers and their Officer,
in the pay of Tripoli, up to that regenc on receiving the Bashaws
tischera for an American Officer of Equa7 rank and three Seamen should any be Captured, This would have included the whole of our
prisoners, CaptQMorris's Mate Excepted, who is an Englishman, and
the son of one of the Collectors of the Customs in England, who only
waited for his papers to arrive, having had the Bashaws promise of
Enlargement the moment of their Amval. Thus Sir, you are made
acquamted, that any Expense or Obligation incurred on the Part of
the United States has been entirely thrown away And has only served
to Embarrass our affairs. The only utility attending the measure
was the Enlarging the prisoners, probably two months sooner than
they otherwise would have been, as I had in answer to an intimation
made to me, that the Bashaw would treat with any Agent of the
United States for the re-establishment of Peace absolutely refused to
listen to any proposal whatever, before he carried into effect the
Convention entered into with Commodore Dale - Since that period
I am informed that a Negotiation is either clandestinely carrying on
between the United States of America, and the Regency of T n oli
through the mediation of Algiers, or in Contemplation; I say a c andestine Negotiation, because if an such exist it must not on1 be
unauthorized by Government, but Lewise in direct Violation o the
Presidents Instructions to me on that head, And I being the only
person vested with full powera to Enter into and to conclude a Treaty
with that Regency, no Negotiation whatever can be valid until i t
receives m sanction and Signature. I therefore shall be in duty
bound to eclare it null and void unless it should be in strict Conformity to my Instructions, which Specifies - "That I am in the
pretension or Expectation,
most eremptory manner to stifle ev

, I will if possible, give it my sanction if any construction
me
a o ers will give me that latitude; should any promiaes of a
of my
pecuniary nature have been made thro' the mediation of Algiers - I
cannot sanction them - but sooner, than risque a difference with that
Regency, I will wait the determination of Government. It is devoutly to be wished, that no such arrangement has been made, h d it
seems to me Extremely equivocal and absurd, that the Regency of
LUgiem, having lent a deaf ear to all the amicable references and
remonstrances of the United States, Should now Espouse the cause
of the Messor, But it certainly would be more absurd for the United
States to admit them - I should thank you to give me every information on that Subject, You are Master of Commodore Morris, who is now here, delivered to me, together

SIRAfter one of the most tempestious assages, of nearly a Month
from Toulon, (where I remained three flays to repair my Rudder)
beating constantly against heavy Gales of Westerly Winds, I arrived
here in distress, havin sprungmy fore mast, and fore yard, & expended
all my Bread, I was or some Days on half allowance, & here I have
met with great difiiculties for want of proper conveniences, having no
resources but within myself, for getting out my Mast, & have been
obliged to fish my fore yard, & raise it three feet to make a shore
with the Main Yard, however, we are oing on very well, & shall, I
hope be enabled to et through all our d c u l t i e s in due time
Fortunately the ay after my arrival the John Adam arrived here,
& from her I have taken most of her Provisions, & also supplied the
Enterprize, who also came in a few Days after, & now dispatch her
back to you, presuming that she may be of service to run backwards,
& forwardsin your ne otiations As soon as the ohn Adam8 gets a little Calking, which Cap9
Ro[d]gers says she stands in need off, I shall send her to Gibralter to
load with provisions, & to bring me my fore yard, and then dispatch
her to you, & when my repairs are done, all of which I shall have to do
with my own Carpenters, (that is in fishing my Mast) I shall proceed to
Gibralter for Provisiom, & join you as soon as possible, unless the
Adam can bring them up As soon as I arrived here, I sent off an express by land to Campbell,

the Enterprize came in alone her Convoy having been dispersed in

Crtpt Morris might want her services, & re uestsd Cap$ Rodgers to

Tripolitan Ship to have sailed long since, we shou'd have soon taken
her, & not have lost the use of a Frigate watching her, I took my fore Mast out & have been obliged to take it all to

The New Pork sailed from this the Da previous to my arrival, I
did not meet with her but she m w t be at Laltn by this time with the

there was nothing wanting but a ne otiator, but the instabilit of the

~ I R !In compliance with a Letter from you, I inform you of the
state of the U. S Shi ConstiSzLtion About 30 days ago the ship was
pumped out and she
I ! ad four feet & two inches of water in her hold;
altho' it was pumped out with the chain pum in 35 minutes, there
was 60 or 65 Tons of water in her. Before t e Constitution hauled
into the Wharf to receive her re airs she leaked a small quantity.
During the time the ship layed t ere & five weeks after she hauled
into the stream she continued perfectly tight. About the middle of
August September & the greatest part of October last she leaked
three feet & eight or nine inches every eight or nine da s. Since the
middle of October last she has not leaked so much.
tho't a t one
time the leak must have originated from a trunnel or bolt being drove
slack in her bottom, but since that I have conversed with Mr Hartt
who was the master-builder & he says it was im ossible that any
neglect of that kind could have happened. I t is K r Hartts determined opinion as well as my own that the leak must have originated
from her being on shore gear Cape Francois which was on the 22
July 1800. The particulars of that day I cannot give as the Log
Book of that date is at the Navy Department, but however the Ship
was on the outreef near the Cape 47 minutes & every officer & man
in the ship expected the masts would go over the side. At the time
the ship received her repairs, the copper was taken off her s a h g
trim six streaks down and as far as the Copper could be seen under
water when the ship was on a creen it was found full of holes some of
which were of the bigness of a Dollar leavin the plank entirely bare.
For the truth of this, Sir, I beg leave to re er you to Mr Hartt, Mr
Hatch, Mr Swift & Mr Hartt the younger, who all live in this town &
were employed as foreman in co pering the ship. The Grass, Sea
moss & muscles which you saw r ed from the slvps bottom is a very
convincing proof that the co per is in many places entirely & totall
destroyed. I have two or tLee times swept the ships bottom wi
ropes & I am confident the keel is in many places shivered & chafed.
By taking a boat hook & nrnning i t under many parts of the shi s
bottam it may be hooked into the ships bottom [which] is an ad{tional proof the copper is worn out. The Ships spars riggin $ sails are all in complete order & as to
Cables & shi has enoug for harbor use but must have three new
ones before s e proceeds to sea. On board the U S FRIGATE

French Commercial agent residing at the latter Place; I now enclose

Brent Esqr in your Absence ated Washington 26 August by assuring
you, that the Instructions therein contained shall serve as a Guide
for my Conduct in r ard to such distressed Seamen as may come
this way, tho' I consi er it necessary to observe that Twelve Cents
pr diem, will rocure a very scanty fare for any One in this Place,
On the 17 Ui' t 9 the New Pork, James Barron Esqr Commander called
in here, with an Intention to fill his Water Casks, and give some
repairs to his Frigate, but finding on our Joint Application
z ? r 8 v e r n o r , that He started objections to her coming In to the
Mole where they could alone be made with Expedition, and any
degree of Safety He determined to proceed on the day followin to
Algiers, and in case the Wind should become Contrary to
in
either a t Cartsgena or Mahon, However as I have since heard nothing
from him, and the Wind continued favorable for several days after
his departure, I should presume He reached his destined Port in
safety.
On the Evening of Ca t Barron's departure, the Frigate Consf&lion Alexander Murray %sqr Commander arrived here, in distress,
having sprung her fore Mast, on his Passage from Toulon, and in
great Want of Provisions, I immediately laid before our Governor
the Situation, that the Consfeuationwas m, and procured Permission
for her being admitted into the Mole, Where the re airs she stood
in need of, have been compleated, but to revent enceforward a
Second denial on the pnrt of our Governor, 8apt Murray, as well as
myself have written to the Charge des Maires in Madnd, to Solicit
from the Spanish Ministry a General Permission for all our Frigates
to come in to the Mole when they arrive here, as in the Bay, they
are much exposed in the Winter Season,
The Schooner Enterprize, and Frigate John Adums, have since successivel called in here, the former proceeded on the 26 Ultp with
despatc es in quest of Commodore Morris and the latter to Gibraltar,
for Provisions with which she returned on the 10 Inst; I have been
exceedingly mortified to learn from Capt Murray, that all our Frigates
actually in the Mediterranean, except Two, are ordered Home, It
roves the more distressing at this moment when even a greater
Force would be requisite, for the Protection of our Trade, in Coquence of Sweden, having made Peace with Tripoly, and that I
undemtand the Bashaw of Tunis has made fresh demands, not withstanding the very handsome Present that was lately made him, So
little dependance can be placed on all the Barbary Powers, that a
considerable force, should, in my humble opinion, be constantly kept
in these Seas, to prevent depredations on our Trade, which of late
has been very extensive, if not it must gradually decrease, and fall
into other Hands,

Repairs of the John A h being compleated, Capt Rodgers has
proceeded this morning for Malta, proposing on his Paestbge up, to
give a call in a t Almeria, to endeavor to find out whether they are

SIR,I wrote you immediately on my arrival at Gibralter, by a Ship
bound to Baltimore, and enclosed you a Muster Roll and Inspection
return. Since that time the only alteration in the detachment, has
been occasioned by the death of WmPrin[c]e - he died Novr 28" of
a Fever - The other Men are recovering, but have been so sickly that
I have rarely mustered on parade more than 15 Men fit for duty.
This circumstance has occasioned me much uneasiness. I have pald
every attention in my power to remedy it, and they have every possible indulgance from Capf Rogders and the W c e r s on board. Mr
Kirkpatrick received a letter from Mr O'brien at Algiers, mentioning
that a number of Tripolitan Zebecks had escaped from Tripoli since
the Swedes had effected a peace with them. We hope Fortune will
favor us in falling in with them. They have so many smali Vessells
however, that many of them will doubtless esca e our vigilance.
And the Constel~atwnand Cksapeak being ordered ome, it is feared
the American Commerce will be left with a very inadequate defence.
We sail tomorrow for Malta. I continue to be happily situated on
board, and much leased to inform you that the greatest harmony
subsists between
the Officers in the Ship. Mr Smith requests I
would present you his respects. With real esteem and respect,

of resistance and coercion without exciting a

useful here under actual circumstances. Any body whose fidelity
may be depended on, and who is capable of writing an inteiligible
letter, may be of equal service and less exposed. This Regency
view me with a jealous and suspicious eye. They say, "the American
Consul is an enemy to the Barbary interests." (God forbid that he
should be a friend to them.) And, in case of a rupture, I have not
the least reason to suppose the Bey would consent to my departure.
When the commodore and Mr. Cathcart arrive I shall consult with

the knowledge of such being near us, is a tar better security for

Notwithstanding I assured him (after having received Capt"
Campbells answer to what I wrote him) that the Shi would not meet
any rntemption a t leaving Gibraltar, they chose to ay her up again,
but still retain the Passports granted.
Hashash continues a t Tetuan, for some weeks he has been silent
on this subject, perhaps waiting farther Orders from His Majest ,
with whom the intercourse is no doubt tedious at this season, especia y
as we have had an imensity of Rain during this and last Month. You will have seen the affair of this Ship has not been touched upon
in any of the Letters I have received from His Majestys Minister
since my return to this Country; neither have I considered i t a matter
proper to be opened by me to him, as I have had reason to know His
Majesty had left i t totally to the management of Alcayde Hashash,
and consequently according to their custom none other would
interfere. I regreted the Gun Carriages did not come forward as was intended,
however the Emperors absence makes the delay less material. I hope they may soon now be here. The Larach Ship finished her Cruize without makeing any Capture,
and is now laid up in that River. The Galleys will be ready to put to Sea from Tetuan, when the
season such Vessels navigate in arrives. -- Some Masts are yet wanting
for the Ships a t Salli, i t is expected one will be ready next Spring,

send both to Sea. -

dollars & seventy one Cents, every Item of which I fully persuade
myself d l be admitted as justly stated to Government in my Public
Accounts. - The sum given to Alcayde Hashash, was put in his hand
a t Tetuan when I sobcited his preventing the Frigate sailing from
Larach, until1 His Majestys answer should arrive, to what I was then
about to write; which had so good an effect, he very shortly after
hinted that even the Order given Captain Lubarez for capturing Americans might be withdrawn. - This with the Silver Tea Pot stated in
the Account is all I have yet given him. Sidy Mehamrned Selawy has not yet been presented with any
money, but it was necessary to have it ready, in case he should send
any of his confidential Friends to receive the gratuity he undoubtedly
expects, which is the only mode of doing those things here, when a

PRUSBIA,
has not 8ny Treaty of Peace with Morocco - in 1799 on
the occasion of a Prussian Vessel being taken by a Salleteen Frigate
the King of Spain interceded for the release of the Crew, which the
Emperour granted without Ransom, at same t.ime expressing his
readyness to enter into a Treaty of Freindship with Prussia.
SWEDEN,
for nearly thirty years back has been in the habit of sending periodical Presents to Morocco, consisting chiefly in Naval &
Ordnance Stores, but without any actual stipulation to that effect by
Treaty. - Untill Sidy Mohamets death those Presents were sent
every other year, accompanied by an Ambassador; at Rhabat in 1795
His present Majesty consented to receive them every third year. In 1798 an Embassy was accordingly sent; - that expected in Spring
1801 came only last January - the deravement with England
was pleaded as an excuse for the delay. - HIS Majesty complained
(it is believed with justice) that the Articles then sent, as well as those
of 1798 were in general of inferrior Quality, and conse uently not of
such value, as the Presents had usualy been sent by weden to his
Father. -On this principle he demanded in March last an extra Present
in Jewelery to the Amount of thirty thousand dollars, and after some
Negotiation directed that the Consul should quit his Dominions,
until1 those Articles should be sent; threatening to commence hostilities at the end of six Months, if his demand was not granted. The Consul accordingly went to Stockholm, and is now on his
return by Land, but the determination of His Swedish Majesty on the
Emperour's demand, is not yet known here. Sweden never has had any direct Commerce with this Country.
DENMARK,
continues to pay its Annual Tribute of twenty five
thousand dollars. -Formerly a Com sny of Danish Merchants were
established a t S r Cruz, but having f ad''ed m perforrmng certain engagements made with the then Emperour, they quitted the Country.
At present there does not exist any Commerce between Denmark
and Morocco, - The Danish Vessels as others, come to Mogadore and
other Ports occasionaly, Freighted. HOLLAND,
has not yet sent any Ambassador to Muley.Soliman since
his Accession to the Throne, or renewed its Treaties m t h him. - I t
is said Admiral DeWinter comes to Tangier for that purpose, his
appearance in these Seas, in the mean tune seems to have quleted the
Emperows irnportunitys on the subject of an Embassy. The Dutch never pmd any Tribute to this Country, and commonly
were spareing in their Presents to the Em emur, save when it became
necessa to send an Ambassador. - t is well understood that
Muley % b a n intends demanding an Annual sum from Holland,
whenever their Ambassador may come for pu ose of renewing their
Treaties. - I t is observeable that notmthstan mg the length of time
since Peace was restored to Hollrfnd in Europe, scarce any of their
Vessels have to this day appeared m the Medlterranefm. One House of Commerce under the Batavian protection is established
at Mogadore, that Port has always carried on a considerable Trade
with Amsterrdam as well in Import as Export. ENGLAND,
by repeated Treaties had been promised unlimited supplies of Proviaiom from this Country for its Garrisons in the Mediter-

ranean & Fleets employed in these Seas, a t established and moderate
rates of Duty; d u m g all the present year thm accommodation has
been denied them, beyond a uantity not even equal to the consumption of Gibraltar for SIX Mont q save a t thrice the duty established by
Treaty; which they now pay for all taken above the Monthly quantity of Cattle, still allowed to be shipt a t the former rate; - In other
respects we have not observed any innovation. England never has been subjected to the payment of any Tribute
to this Country, and but seldom sends Present5 to the Emperour. At Mogadore there are three English Houses, who carry on a pretty
extensive Trade with their Country. FRANCE,
has lately intimated to Muley Soliman, that having no
immediate matter to treat upon with him, besides what can be done by
their Commissary for Commercial Concerns resident a t this place, the
Consuls do not see occasion for sending an Embassy. - Hitherto the
antient Treaty between France & Morocco has not been ratified by
Muley Solirnan; the person Commissionated for that effect in 1795
was on his Voyage from Marsellies detained by the English, and sent
Prisoner to England. There are some French Houses of Commerce established at Mogadore, and one a t Rhabat; - between those places and Marsellies
Trade begins to revive, having during the last War been entirely
suspended. France never paid Tribute to Morocco & but very seldom made
Presents of consequence to the Emperor. PORTUGAL,
imports from Morocco Grain & Cattle in large quantitys,
scarce any other Commerce is carried on between the Countries. A matter of dispute has arisen between the Courts lately, in conse uence of a Compan of Merchants from Lisbon established a t
Sa y, for shipment of drain for that City, having failed in perforrning certain Contracts, made with the Emperour for his T the Wheat
& Barley of 1800 & 1801 collected in the Provinces of A da - Duquella & Schedma.
On the part of His Majesty it is alledged Sixty thousand dollars remain due to him, - the Portuguese Merchants assert they were allowed to reject all but sound Corn, and that this demand arises from
a very considerable quantity of damaged Wheat found in the Magazines; - the Emperor has required the Prince of Brazil to do him
Justice on the occasion. Portugal has not been sub'ected to any established Tribute to
Morocco, but makes frequent .resents of value to the Emperour, and
never fails in supplying his Shps of War with Stores when they call
a t Lisbon. SPAIN,notwithstanding the Emperor persists in disavowing the
Treaty of 1799 (so far ss regards the T d of Duties thereby established,) (as advised in NQ35) has not hitherto shewen any disposition
to enforce i t , besides continuing the s u s ~ n c i o nof all Commercial
intercourse mth this Country under Sparush Colours; - the Agents
of the Gromios [?I of Madrid stationed a t the several principal Ports,
inactive. - The Emperour is indebted to that
One hundred thousand dollars, for Amount of
for Public Service; payment of this eum
been instructed by his Court to demand of
the Emperour. -

Even in this state of little Friendship Spain continues to make
Presents of considerable value to the Emperor with frequency. GERMANY,
NO Treaty has yet taken place between the Emperour
of German and Morrocco. -Sidy Mohamet however allowed Tuscan
& Imperi Vessels to Trade to his Ports without molestation.
The Imperial Consul at Cadiz lately wrote Alcayde Hashash a
letter, deslring to know if Vessels under their Colom could Trade
with safety to this Country as formerly; -his answer was that Muley
Soliman desired an Ambassador should be sent him, in order that Peace
might be firmly established between them. As the Emperor of Germany is now in possision of Venice, which
paid tan thousand Zequins yearly to this Country, it is known Muley
Solirnan will endeavour at geting that Tribute continued.
GENOA,
formerly had an Agent resident here, but has not renewed
its Treaty with Muley Soliman. - Alcayde Hashash in July last detained a small Genoese Vessel here, which was liberated by the Emperor, on the intercession of the French Commissary. ITALY- has not made any Treaty with this Country, but the
French Commissary lately sent Muley Soliman by order of the First
Consul a drawing of the new Flag of this Republic, with a desire that
it might be respected by him;to which no sort of answer has hitherto
been given. RAGUSA,
in consideration of its supplying the Emperour with four
Vessels Annualy for conveying Pilgrrms to and from Alexandria, or
for any other Service required, has long enjoyed Peace with this
Country; but without having any Consul in it, or direct Commerce. NAPLEB,
has never had any Treaty or Commerce with Morocco. SARDINIA,
is in the same situation. - Also
MALTA
and all the other Independent Islands in the Mediterranean. ALGIERS,
of late years has been perfectly at Peace with this Country,
the former Bey of Mascara occasionaly fomented disturbancas on
the Frontiers, with the view of obtaining possesion of a. part of the
Province of Tezza, but since Muley Solimans Accession that has been
accommodated. TUNIS,has but little intercourse with this Country by Sea, neither
TRIPOLY,
the only Article they carry from hence & T?tuan being.a
Saponaceous Earth dug from a. Mountain near Mequmez, used m
their Baths; but all the three enjoy a Trade by land of some consequence, carried on by Csrrtvms from Fez and Mequinez. Muley Soliman most powerfull attached to the Religion of his
Ancestors, Interests himself in w at regards those three Sktes; as
has been experienced in the past he has taken towards favouring
Tripoly; to this State he considers himself pwticularly obhged, by
the Asylum and assistance it affordshis Subjects at their grand resting
time, on their Pilgrimage to Mecca, and return from thence: - probably he now sees more than ordina motive for this partiality, his
second Son Muley Moussa [?]having eft Fez about three Months ago
on that Journey.

various are the reports here respecting several Tripoline Corsairs
being out, they came from Tunis under date of the 9'h Novbr & that
they sailed about the 9'@Octr from Tripoli, as Malta hath a constant
communication with Tripoli & no mention made of such an event in
your Letter of so much later a period I naturally conclude the re

the said report specifies The Adurns hath returned some Days past from Tangier, where she

SIRYOUwill no doubt be surprized to find by the data of this
Letter that I have been so long detained here, I never encountered
with such a mortifying event, we have had nothing but perpetual
heavy Gales of Wind from the Westward, since I have been here,
except the first Day, or two, after my arrival, when I was employed
in taking in my Stores, as a number of Veasels then sailed, & by some
of the best conveyances, I sent your Letters, & at the same time, sent
the Adam8 to Tangier to Mr Smpson to desire him to have his dispatches ready against I call'd for them, once since I made an effort
to call there, but when I got near Tangier, it blew so heavy a Gale
from the S. W. that I was obliged to run to Sea in hopes of better
Weather the next Day, but the Gale still continued with great violence,
& I was under the necessity of Nning in
tlin, to take Shelter in
Tetuan Ba , till it moderated, which it did o the following Day, &
with dific ty got back again to my old Anchorage, where we have
been, fretting ever since; in one of the Gales which was the hardest
I ever felt at Anchor, we broke one of the Ffljukes of our best Bower,
xith a Cable on end, yards & top Mast struck, but the aheet Anchor
being wider foot, brought us up, fourteen sad of Vessels drove on
shore, & many of them will be loft,.Cou'd I have for'seen this mortifymg delay I might have run up to
Malta with Provisions, & lost no time, but we are n m w sighted

this consolation, that I seldom do wrong intentionally. -

To Captnin Richard V. Morris, U. S. Bnvy, from William Eaton, U. 8.
Consul, Tunis

"TUNIS,26th January, 1803.
"SIR,At seven o'clock this morning, I reoeived a mess e from the
Bey's Prime Minister, re uiring m appearance at the p ace. I accordingly rendered mysel there. %he Bey received me in his hall of
justice. He said, the object of his calling on me, was to inform me,
had captured an Imperial vessel, laden with
that an American c&r
merchsndize appert
to his subjects; and to demand restitution.
I observed, that I
eard of the capture of an Imperial vessel
[ P a d i w ] ,laden with merchandize, bound to Tripoli, by one of our
vessels of war; but this advice was not official, nor had I any particular information of the facts. Here follows the substance of what
passed on this subject, between the Bey and myself.
'This,'said he, 'wss a cargo from the Levant, belongin and consigned to one

8

3

of my eubjed., of the Island of Yerba. I t arrived st d a ~ t a There the proprietor chartered an Imperial vessel, into which he t r a n e f e d the cargo, to be
carried fo the port of ite destination; but having two Tripolitan subjects on
board, whom he was obliged to land a t Tripoli, he gave mnst,ructionato the mrrster,
to shape hie course firet to that port, with thb view: with precise ordere, that mf
he encountered any American vessel of war, before the port, to diecontinue the
voy e, and proceed to Yerba; in pursuanw of which imtructiona, the eaid
in with an American aruiaor of two mssta, waa by
ca t u r d . and
r-?fell
~ n d u c t e dto Malta. You are responsible far thecargo.' T o which answered.
I cannot d in question your exoellency'e veracity in thi statement- but, it ie
preeumed, your information on thie eubject must be incorrect. It ie &hly amrobable that a merchant of Yerba, who could not be ignorant of the blockade of
tripoli, should risk a ship to that port, laden with a cargo iptended for Yerba,
merely for the purpose of landing two pamengem, if hie intention wcre not to lsnd
hie cargo there a h ; and the more no, as the port of Yerba is nearly in the diteot
pseease to Tripoli, and but about half the distance.' The Bey hesitated e
moment, and reaumed the subject. 'Well,admit the cargo w w intended for
Tripoli, what right have you to make a prize of it?"

f

WARS WITH BARBARY POWERS
'A very simple one. It is long since I have announced to your excellency, the
blockade of Tripoli, and I have never ceased to caution your agents and subjects,
against making shipments to that port. If, in contempt of this advice and caution, they chuse to risk their property, and it falls into our hands, it becomes, of
course, good prize, by a right founded on the known and received laws of nations,
applicable in such cases.'
'We Barbary States, do not admit the laws of war, established among Christian
nations, applicable to us. We have always enjoyed the exclusive privilege to
assert our own customs. We shall exact the same privilege of you. I therefore
demand the immediate restitution of the cargo in question, with damages for detention. You will communicate tt-is demand to your Commodore, and tell him
to restore the cargo without delay.'
'If the Barbary Regencies have customs or maxims of war peculiar to themselves, and distinct from the general and acknoledged iawa of other belligerent
powers, this is no reason why we should renounce the latter, and conform ourselves to the former, which indeed, are neither specified nor known, and dictated
chiefly by the circumstances of the moment; even though we may find precedent
for such a concession.
'If we were to admit principles so vague and capricious, we might as well a t
once ourselves furnish our enemy with the means of subsistence and offence. I
shnll, however, state to the Commodore as well as to my government, your excellency's reclamation. But i t is incumbent on me a t the same t i e to signify
to you, that though I am not informed what may be the diicretionary power of
the Commodore in like cases, I doubt whether he be authorized to render this
cargo to your claim; because, i t being admitted that i t was destined for Tripoli,
and it being known that this port was in a state of blockade, i t has become good
prize to the captors, the property totally alienated from the shippers, and subject to the disposition of our laws. No decision therefore can be had in favor of
the claimants without the interference of the government of the United States.
But, should they consent to grant an indemnity in this case i t would be an act of
special favor, not of right. I hope your excellency will allow me sufficient time
to submi,t the necessary statement to the President, my master, and wait his
decision.
'No, I will indemnify myself in a shorter and more certain way. You know I
am a t war with Naples and Genoa; I will order my corsairs to make reprisaL~on
your merchant vessels enterinq those ports.'
'True; I know that you are a t war with Naples and Genoa; but, it is indeed
a strange species of war; for we see a t the same time a free commerce between
you and them; nyither one nor the other of those ports can be considered in a
state of blockade.
'They are both in a perpetual state of blockade.'
'This is the first advice I have had of it. I t will serve for my government.
But any indemnity by way of reprisal, even if your claim were well founded,
before the indemnity should be refused t o regular applications, would be a n act
of direct hostility. I profit of this occasion t o re eat to your excellency the wish
of my government, to maintain peace and a goo$intelligence with this Regency.
The evidence already given of this disposition should not admit a doubt, and my
constancy in advising your excellency of all danger which might tend to i n t m p t
it, goes to the same proof. But facts jwtify an apprehension that this desire
is not reciprocal on the part of this Regency. The persevering obstinacy of
your subjects, countenanced by their sovereign, to carry supplies to our enemy;
seems purposely calculated to embroil our affairs, and eventually and unavoidably
will end in a rupture, unless restrained. - I desire therefore that your excellency
will cause suitable measures to be observed, t o impede such a n event.'
'I will use no measures whatever to that effect. My merchantmen will continue their expeditions to Tripoli as usual. I wish to have them captured by
you. I shall ultimately ain more by it, than by the commerce, (me lenctc questo
d y w e m l t o piu qua per far Comerclo) write what

I shall acquaint him with facts. But i t is requisite that I should be furfished
with such documents relative thereto as the nature of the subject requires.
I will cause them to be furnished. You will admit no delay in dispatching
advice to your Commodore, to the effect that my subject may be immediately
re-instated in his property, or ,that I may know the result in order to conform
my measures to circumetances.

For the more effectual protection of the Sesmen & Commerce of
the United States in the Mediterranean and adjacent Seas, I would
recommend that Congress authorize four small Vessels of War, not
exceeding 16 Guns each, to be built or otherwise procured, leaving it
to the discretion of the Executive to procure them in the manner that
mav hereafter be found the most expedient. The subjoined Estimate NQ 1 exhibits the probable expence of
budding a vessel of 14 & 16 Guns. This Estimate is made out from
the best i d o m t i o n I can obtain. The price of Labor and Materials
variee so considerably in the difTerent Sea-Port Towns, thst the expence
of building Vessels depends very materially upon the place selected for
the purpose. It is presumed, however, that on an average $24,000 for
each Vessel, would be sufticient, and of course, should the Executive
be authorized to procure Vessels of the size herein recommended, that
an appropriation of $96,000 would be adequate to the object. The Estimate NQ2 shews tbe annual expence of maintaming a t Sea,

1805
SIR I have the Honor to inform you that I sailed on board the
Chesapeake from Leghorn roads on the 34 of Novr and arrived a t
Malta on the 20t@where we lay untill the 2.P of December when we
got underway in company with the Enterprize schooner and proceeded
to Syracuse in Sicily and return'd to this port on the 4th inst where
we found the New York who had arrived on the 2gt4 of December
and the John Adums who had arrived from the Westward a few
hours before us, by these vessels we are informed that the Constellation
proceeded direct for the United States in consequence of receiving
orders from the Department of the Navy; this Fngate has been the
last off Tripoli and she left that station last August. Commodore
Morris intends to proceed to Tunis with the Squadron under his
command in a few days and from thence he intends to visit Algiers
in consequence of letters which he has lately received from Mr OBrion
stating that the Dey of Algiers has refused to receive a cash payment
in lieu of stores and has demanded one thousand barrels of Gun
powder I suppose as part of our next year's annuity, but as I have
not been furnished with Copies of those letters I cannot be as correct
as I could wish and refer you to Commodore Morris for further
information
Commodore Morris has likewise received the translation of a letter
said to be wrote by the Dey of Algiers to the President of the United
States wherein he declares that he will not receive me as Consul of
the United States: it is not for me to dictate to government on
this or any other subject but as this refusal militates against me as
an individual I request to refer ou for my opinion to an inclosure in
my dispatch N? 8 dated July 4 9 1802 I t re uires no great penetration to perceive that this letter is the
act of t e Jews & M' OBrion who are not desirous that any person
should be appointed possessed of sufficient intelhgence to investigate
their iniquitous practices and the Jews are particularly interested in
wishing to have the Consul of the United States entirely dependent
on them;
I can't omit observing that in the letter from the Dey to the President is specified that the Dey makes the government of the United
States a Present of Capt Morris & crew as an act of his good will and
in Mr OBrion's Accompl dated November the: 2gth 1802 is charged for

the ransom of Captain [Andrew] Monk and crew 6,500 dollars I
confess I csn't perceive an peculiar mark of Friendship in charging
the United States 6,500 do ars for what a t the most exorbitant valuation was only worth 5000 dollars at Tripoli exclusive of his loading
us with an Imaginary weight of obligataon the value of which a t some
future period may be very considerable I declare I cannot reconcile
those absurdities. Some years ago the Government of Great Britain
appointed Mr Fraser their Consul general at Algiers, on his arrival
a t that Place the Dey refused to receive him in consequence of his
being informed that he was a man who would not put up with the
least insult national or personal, the commander that took him to
Algiers inform$ the Dey, that he was order'd by his government to
establish Mr Fraser in his office, that as the Dey did not think proper
to receive him he would take his predecessor away likewise and the
Place should remain vecant untiU the will of his master was known
the Government of that Kingdom took no further notice of Algiers
untill the Dey wrote to the King and requested him to appoint a
Consul when Mr Fraser was sent there again and received and remaind there untill he was superceeded by Mc Benton who when he
was appointed was resident Consul a t Tripoli
The copy of your letter of the 27 of July last, I received on the 6tQ
of Decs as the New York deliver'd to Mr OBrion the original long
before I received the copy no doubt he has acted as you desired and
has informed you of the result I have not had an opportunity. Yours
of the 224 of August I had the Honor to receive the same day and in
answer beg leave to inform you that I have not had it in my power
to transact any of the business entrusted to my guidance but will

The engagement reported to have taken place between the Boston

of the kind ever appen'd.
By my last dispatch (a copy of which is enclosed) you are informd
that the position, taken by the brother of the reigning Bashaw of
Tripoli, before the arrival of Commodore Morris, joined to Sweden
having concluded a dishonourable peace with that Regency, render'd
it necessary, to discard any measures that might have been in contemplation before that penod, this was done in a manner, that will
neither tarnish our honor, pr injure our interest's

are glad to maintain our Peace with them upon any terms however
degrading and exorbitant

Yesterday and to day the enclosed letters IVOQ1. 2 3.4, were received from Barbary, with another from MI Eaton, addressed to Commodore Morris The
pressing manner in which Mr Eaton desired a conference, induced him to dispatch
the Schooner Enlerpn'ze to Tunis, with a letter from himself, and enclosure NQ5,
which informed Mr Eaton, that the Objects Commodore Morris had in view would
not admit of his appearing off Tunis a t that moment, But that he would take the
first convenient opportunity to parade the whole Squadron before that Port.
The Objects which Commodore Moms had in contemplation were, to proceed off
Tripoli, and if a favorable answer was not given to our proposals of Peace, to take
the moat advantageous position to intercept vessels trading to, and from said
port, until a favorable opportunity preeented, for sending the boats of the
Squadron into the Harbour to destroy their cmizers. Preparations for which had
already been made on board the Ships of the Squadron.

Anchored in Tunis Bay, Cape Carthage Bearing Nj/4.E, distant, about 3 Miles,
and about 6 Miles from the Castle a t Goletta - T h ~ sEvening a t 6 P M, Mr
Eaton came on board, and reported to the Commodore that he had demanded
permission from the Bashaw to come on board, but was refused. The Bashaw
saying that i t was customary before such permission was granted, for the Commodore to report his amval a t the Goletta. That he having previously obtained
permission to visit the schooner when he thought proper, made use of that medium
to procure an intewiew with the Commodore, and i t being late, came off in her
boat, being under no apprehension of detection. Mr Eaton remained on board
all night, read over several of his Communications to Government. The whole
of which tended To prove the great utility the appearance of the Squadron
would be to our affairs with this Regency, and to impress the Commodore with
the Idea t h s t a personal interview with the Bsshaw, would be expected, and was
absolutely neceseary; as none of the Commanders in Chief of our Squadron had
ever paid him that Compliment.
[Feb 234
Mr Eaton went on Shore this morning, reported the arrival of the Squadron.
returned, and said he had legal permission to paas, and repass, as he thought
proper. He stated to the Commodore the Bashaws reclamation of the Tunisian
property captured in the prize, and referred the Commodore to his letter on that
sub'ect, of the 26+Pof January. [See 17 January.]
heb.1 24th
The Commodore answered the Bashaws demand in writing, relative to the
Tunisian property claimed by him. Mr Eaton took his letter on shore, and I
accompanied him to Tunis, in order to induce the Commodore to visit the Bashaw.
As I really supposed, his presence would be of infinite sewice to our affairs here.
I likewise wished to know how far the Bashaw, would put his threat into Esecution, as he had declared last year, that he would not permit me to land in his
territory upon any consideration. The sequel serves to prove how often those
Baahaws wear unmeaning frowns, and the necessity of observing a decisive line
of conduct in the most trifling transactions. I did not wait upon the Bashaw,
in Compliment to the Commodore, Neither did I receive the visits of the Consuls
of other Nations, for the same reason.
[Feb.] 25'4
Mr Eaton and Myself returned on b o d the Chcsapeah. Mr Eaton reported
in an Official manner that the Baahaw demanded that the Commodore should
come on Shore, that the validity of the Prize should be versed a t Tunis. And
had signified in the most unequivocal terms, that if these pro sitions were not
compLied with, tbat he would declare War against the United k t e s of America.
The Bashaw likewise interrogated Mr Eaton, to know the reason why I had not
visited him, as is customary for aU public chanrctels to do on their arrival in his
Dominions. He answered that I would wait upon him, in Company with the
Commodore.

The Commodore, Captaii Rodgers, and several Officors from the Squadron
landed and proceeded to Tunis in Company with Mr Eaton and my& IFob.1 27tb

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1802 TO 1803

Received the visits of all the Consuls resident in this Regenc . This Evening
the Commodore had a private conference with Hadgi TTnis Ben &is, the Basham
Commercial Agent. As I was not resent I am not lnformed on what subject.
Hamet Guirgies, Agent of Hamet kaahaw the dethroned sovereign of Tripoli.
and now Bey of Derna, waited a t the Consular house this Evening, and reported
that his Master only waited for the Co-operation of our Squadron to proceed
against Tripoli; that he could bring to the assault 30,000 men, who are determined
to conquer the usu r or die in the attempt. That should the event be proitious, which t h e y E d no noreran to doubt. That Hamet Bashaw promim in
gehalf of himaelf and successors, a perpetual peace and friendship with the
United States, and will not heaihte to sign the contract in anticipation, but a t
the same time observed that his Master requested a supply of 20 Quintals of
powder, and 16,000 dollars in cash to aasist his Operations. The Commodore
said he would consider how far, he would meet their proposals; and seperated
for the Evening.
Febr 28tP
This morning were admitted to a Public audience in the Ambassadors Hall.
After the ceremony of shaking hands and drinking coffee was over. The Bashaw
proceeded to demand that the Validity of the capture should be verified a t Tunis.
The Commodore persisted in his intention to send the Prize to Gibraltar to be
tried by a regular Court of Admiralty, and promised to abide by their decision.
When the Bashaw explicitly told him that except the investigation should be had
on the spot, and the property of his subjects restored; that he would place the
United States in the same situation here, as they are with Tripoli, meaning that
he would declare war against us. The Commodore consented, on condition that
the Bey would rest the issue on the Evidence to be deduced from the regular
papers found on board the Prize, and that he would wave all pretensions to such
roperty as should not appear bona fide to belong to his Subjects. To this the
%ashaw consented; he then insisted on his right of commerce with Tripoli in
defiance of an actual Blockade, although he would consent that we might turn
away his vessels that right was contested. The Bashaw replied, that we might
if we pleased capture his vessels, but, that in the event we should loosetwo for one,
the Commodore observed, that if he resorted to reprisals, by way of indemnification for regular captures, he might possibly lose three for one, but as the Commodore did not desire me to interpret his last observation, the Bashaw remained
in ignorance of it. The Commodore requested me to ask the Bashaw, whether
in case of seizure on our part of contraband articles destined to Tripoli by his
subjects, he should think of reclaiming such articles. He addressed himself to
me, and said, you have been long among us and know our manners, inform the
Commodore that we Turks are not in the habit of thinking for tomorrow, it will
be time enough to discuss points, after the event has taken place, we are not fond
of volumnious communications, and never make unnecessary contracts - We
retired, ss nothing decisive could take place until the Papers were on shore for
which Lieutenant Smith was immediately dispatched. Hamet Guirgies returned this evening for the Commodores answer who absolutely refused to pay any sum in cash, but pr6mised to furnish him with twenty
barrels of Powder, and eng ed to Cooperate with Hamet Bashaw before Tripoli
in the month of June. ~hesfigentrequested, to give him a passage in the Schooner
to Derna in order to Communicate to the Bey his Master. This m a n ement.
This the Commodore refused to do, when the Agent observed that Hamet %ashaw
wes in Arms and if he succeeded without our saeistance that we could not in
justice expect a peace upon the same terms, that we would Obtain i t if we Cooperated with him. We answered that whoever Governed Tripoli must expert
to be forced to an honorable peace, though our wishes were to conclude one or1
terms of mutual convenience without having recourse to arms - The above
observation m a y serve to convince us that those nations, even in the moment of
soliciting our assistance, believe that they have a right to ex ct a premium from
all Christian Nations as the Price of their Friendship.
Unis Ben Unis
in conversstion with the Commodore and Mr Eaton informed them, that his
master was very much interested for Tripoli and desired very much that we
should conclude a peace with that Regency, alledged that they were poor, and had
better pay them something, than continue the War a t so great an Expence. The
Commodore Negatived the proposition, and Mr Eaton informed me (for I was
not presont a t this conference myself) that he candidly told him that the Baahaw
of Tripoli need never Expect to receive one dollar from the United 6 t a h Mr Eaton then commenced to Expatiate on the disagreeable situation he had

And the Agent on the part of his Master promised that no farther claims should
be made, and that he would not interfere, directly or indirectly in any thing
relative to the part of the Cargo which appertained to the Subjects of Tripoli.
The Parties seemed perfect1 satisfied with each other, and we ffsttered ourselves
that the appearance of the &uadron in this Bay had tranquilized our affairs with
this Regency for some time. This appeared of more importance, as their Cruizers
were fitting out to cruize (it was believed) upon the commerce of the United
States, but a t present i t is reported that they are destined against the Swedes.
March 3 d
Hadgi Unis Ben Unis made fresh demands for the restitution of one half of
Forty seven casks of raisins, said to be shipped by the Tripolitan Jew, and a
Subject of Tunis in partnership. The Commodore consented that they should be
delivered up to the proprietor in consequence of said Unis giving the Captors a
Certificate apecyfying that said goods should be paid for, if proved to be the
pro rty of Tripoline Subjects a t Gibraltar [garch] 4th
This Morning Had@ Unis Made more demands for seve1-31articles not included
in the Manifest, and solemnly swore by his Maker that they were mentioned
yesterday, and that the Commodore had promised to deliver them up to the
proprietor, in consequence of receiving a similar certificate to that promised for
the raisins. I lost all patience a t so b a r e f w d a falsehood, called him a n impostor
destitute of shame, he went away in a Pet, and the Commodore in order to prevent
detention thought proper to accede to his demand, however unjust, and to prevent
a repetition, determined to embark immediately, he having previously intended
to take leave of the Bashaw, ss is customary when a Public Officer leaves this
Country. A t 9 AM. We proceeded to the mole in order to embark on board a Moorish
Sandal to carry ua down the lake to the Goletta, where the Ships boats were waiting
for us. Hadgi Unis Ben Unis, foliowed us and preeented an obligation from Mr
Eaton for the sum of 34,000 d o l k (see NQ6) tmying that Mr Eaton had promised
him, that when the Squadron arrived, the Commodore would pay him, and that
he would hold the Commodore in security until the sum was paid. Mr Eaton
denied that he had made the Commodore responsible for the sum, he said he had
only told Hsdgi Unis, t b t he hoped when the uadron arrived, that he would
be able to pay him - they both persisted in what t ey respective1 alledged -The

to the Consular house. The Commodore

ultimately, he informed the Commodore that the Baahaw particularly requested,
that I might go with him to the P b to interpret between the Partiee. I
desired to be excused this disagreeable business, but without effect Mmh5
Went to the Palace a t 8 AM, and during the audience which lasted two hours,
the same ground was run over, and the conclusion was exactly the same relative
to the Prize goods as is related Yesterday
Hadgi Unis presented M: Eatons
bond and demanded payment, again pensisting that be had promised that on the
arrival of the Commodore he should be paid, This Mr Eaton contradicted as
The Commodore asked why this Obligation had not been presented to
before
him before, and observed that i t was very extraordmary that he had not been
made acquainted with a transaction of such importance before the moment he
was going to embark. The Bashaw answered that he had not mentioned it, a t
his audience of reception in hopes that i t would be terminated amicably without
his interposition - That his Agent applied to him for Justice, and that he had
promised to speak to him when he came to take leave, that the agent seeing that
he was going to embark and having no hopes of recovering the Money from the
Consul, impeded his passage, and added that though it was an act unauthorized
by him, that his Agent wss perfectly right; for says the Bashaw if the Commodore
was permitted to embark without settling this affair, would you like to hear that
we had imprisoned Your Consul for Debt, and if he was imprisoned, would that
refund the cash. The Commodore promised the debt should be discharged
either this day or tomorrow if the weather permitted. Mr Eaton perskted in saying he had never promised, that the Commodore on
his amval would assume his debts, said he had some property of his own, and with
the relief he e cted from Government he had hoped to make all square, er'e
now, he t h e n x m a n d e d if ever the Bashaw had been deceived by him, No
answered the Bashaw you have a good heart, but a bad bead, those entrusted
with the guidance of important &ah muat be endowed with a great deal of
forbearance. I am obliged to exercise i t myself, and recommend i t to you, no
wonder answered Mr Eaton that my head is bad when I am surrounded by
Impostors. Your Agent among other things informed me, that you would never
permit Ms Cathcart to land in your territory, though now you send for him erpressly. and your Prime Minister (who was present) has robbed me of my property. Otherwise I should not a t this moment be convened before your Excellency. As things had gown to a height of which I had no conception, I a t this
moment requested the Bashaw to procure another interpreter, which he refused
to do, and the Commodore joined in the request that I would continue to interpret
between the Parties; Thus was I placed in the most disagreeable situation 1map;inable without being permitted to retire. "You are mad says the Minister ,
Yes you are Mad stuttered the Bashaw in a Phmnzy, a t the same time curli~ig

chastised, because he was insolent in my house, And aa for kamin and the others,
If I had them elsewhere, they should receive severer treatment. You might do
what you please in your own Country continued the Bashaw, but if you had
killed a Man in mine I would have had you hung at your own door; and your
saying that My Agent epoke unfavorable of MT Cathcart, even was i t true,
could only create mischief by your informing him of i t - The Commodore
requested me to ask the Baahaw if he was really determined to send Mr Eaton
out of his Dominions. The Baahaw Answered, Yea, he shall no longer remain
here; inform him then says the Commodore that I have not power invested in
me to change a Consul, but t b t as he has a right by treaty to have the Comul
changed, that I w i i leave an Officer in MT&tons place untll the Will of Government ia known; And then demanded if there was any farther im

relative to a Ship the latter haa a t Leghorn, and which he has given up for 7000
dollars in part payment of his debts, which with 6000 more which he promises to

would send the cash on board again. Mr Holck then Came in and said he would

L
vingpresented itself from a variety of circumatanoes o9this Bey's
resolution to hunt our Commerce in the Atlantic; and having ineffec-

tually tried all pacific means, which offered without compromitting
rights, to avert the mischief, I have once more resorted to the dernier
expedient of refusing my Pass rts to his Cruisers - at the same time
giving it in confidence to a ourtier, who I knew would betray it to
the Government, that, in addition to four frigates and some smaller
Vessels now on the Barbary coast, there were nine others daily expected
to re-enforce them - This ste , though it might change the apparent
ground of offence, could not tar the nature of facts; and, if it should
not better the posture of Affairs, it certainly could not effect any
thing for the worse - It was under the influence of thk view of things
that, on the 29" ult. I made this resolution public. The h t effect
it roduced was, as usual, a visit from the Bey's commercial Agent,
wi h Solemn,jriendly warnings not to take so rash a step; that it ammnted
to a declaration of war; that it might involve me in ine&ricable di,@dties,
as the intire responsiWity for the consequences would devolve on myself
alone; and thd nothing bud his disenterested concern for my welfare induced him to interfere to dimuadt?me jrom measzlres which could not but
eventudy be advantageom to the B y ! To which I answered - That
as the Bey had declared to me his resolution to make reprisals on our
Commerce, the position I had taken resulted indispensibly from my
duty; that it was impossible for me to change that position so long a .
the Bey adhered to his; and that, whatever might be the consequences,
I had only to revert to facts for my justification. A calm ensued for
several days. Previously to this new altercation, with a view of
gaining time, I had engaged a friend to amuse the Bey with an indirect
roposition of treating for a definite term of Peace on condition of the
nited States sending him a Sloo of war. I now re uested him to
bring the subject directly to the ey in my name.
e did so ; and
yesterday reported to me, that, though the Bey did not recede from
his pretentions, the position taken on my part had influenced him to
change his; and, instead of Americans, to order the expedition fitting
out at Porto farina to run upon the Swedes.
I t will recur that, on the 3e instant, the Bey had consented to a
com romise with the Swedish Agent. The latter reposes in a reliance
on t at convention, totaliy wus icious of the mischief projecting and the injunction of secrecy un er which I receive this information
forbids my intimating any thing of it to him. Indeed I reconcile
myself with the more composure to this prohibition on the dictates
of humanity, because I know he supposes the expedition intended
against Americans, and exults w i t h himself on his intrigue and
adroitness in having influenced its direction. But the reflection
impresses itself nevertheless forcibly, that the Commercial policy of
Christian Courts, which im osea the duty of this cruel intrigue on
their A ents, is most cow
y and wicked!
My riend advised me to see the Bey; and without affecting to
know an thing of his last determinations, to bring him to explanations - immediate1 sent my drogaman to the Palace to demand a
rivate audience.
Bey, with unusial grace, consented; and said
!!might suii the time to my own contceniewe! I waited on him this morning at the Palace. He admitted me in his private hall, no other
person being present; and asked, if I had any thing mzo to communi-

cate?' I answered, no! My chief motive in re uesting this audience
was to be informed whether he still continue in his resolution of
indemnifying himself for the late ca ture b reprisals on our Commerce? He asked, if I wnted lau! $ said ?thought I had been the
medium of sufficient proof of our pacific disposition towards him;
but it was my duty to guard ainst decoy and s h e ; and, as he
had declared his intentions o reprisal, I had =en
precautions
accordingly; that his Cruisers would consequently be subject to capture
by our frigates: but that, as he had refused to listen to my request
of waiting the decision of the President on the subject of his reclamation, he could not construe this as an offensive act on our art - He
e affected
asked, where our frigates were? I told him, on the coast.
not to have been understood by me - and said he was willing to wait
the arrival of the Commodore for the adjustment of this affair. I
repeated to him, that it was not in the power of the Commodore to
decide on the question; that the capture being regular, and a moiety
of it rested in the right of the Captors, no power subordinate to the
Government of the United States could grant him indemnity - He
revived the sub'ect of the frigate and the Cattle. I told him i t was
not yet time to ave an answer relative to the former; and that I had,
a few days since, answered to his enquiry in writting concerning the
latter - he must have patience. He sctld he would wait the &val
of the Commodore for the further discussion of the sub'ect of the
Capture; and the answer of the President respecting his ot er claims:
but he should relinquish neither one nor the other. I again requested
him to prohibit the enterprizes of his merchantmen to Tripoh - to
which he made no answer - I stood a while in silence - He bid
me good morning It results from these late events that this Pirate is cautious of
prowling among our merchantmen while he apprehends our Ships of
war on the watch; that we shall neither have peace nor an open rupture
here the ensuing season, as has been the case the last; that his resolution to persevere in forcing a commerce to Tripoli will, most probably,
eventually augment his hat of reclamations: and that he will sieze
a moment when we are off our guard,as was the case with the Danes and
is sctually the case with the Swedes, to insult our flag under a pretext
of seeking indemnity.
Events also afford additional evidence that, if nothing is to be
gained here by concessions, we loose nothing by a reasonable resistsnce
and a little finnness I have received no direct information from any of our Squadron
since M
q Cathcart's letter of 25. Nov. - nothing from Tripoli since
the Article of the French Agent's letter of 17. Dec., communicated in
my last Dispatches - nor any thing from Algiers since M' OBrienJs
of 26. Nov. - and only one of our frigates has anchored in this road
since Jannuary 1802. It is presumed the Commodore is c r u i s i i for
the Tripolitan Admiral, who has long since been at Sea with a Squadron, and who is said to have assed the straits.
Since the arrival of the C evalier DeBarthe's, the ob'ect of whose
mission I mentioned in m letter of 12. Nov. nothing as a peared
to his assistance. And tge Bey has been heard to say g a t , hid
Sepuim and j e d d h e w e in.uence with the Grand Signor than
the intederence of Rwrsia. If the event of renewed hostilities in
Europe should not divert the powers, engaged in the success of this

mission, from this to more weighty objects the Bey will find that he
relies on a fatal security - the storm must break upon him. And
it were devoutly to be wished that the United States might profit
of the moment to compel him to recognize their Independence!
M friend, to whom I have so often had reference in m late dispato es, insinuated to me a few days since, that the "Jew 8irectoryv
at Algiers encouraged thie Bey to persist, in his demand for a frigate;
assuring him that it is only necessary to be firm in order to secure
success; alwa s quoting our examples with the Dey: and that they are
engaged in t L s project from personal enmity t m r d s m. I do not
give this Article as an oracle; though it suggests nothing improbable.-

I regret that a misrepresentation of facts,

by Mr Eaton Consul from the Unitsd S t a h . Viz: Immediate
restitution of the Imperial Vessel [ P a d i m ]captured [17 January 18031
by the United States Schr Enterprize belonging to the Squadron under
my Command.

facts relative to that cnpture, You will acquiesce in the right the Commander of the said Schooner had, to detain that Vessel for adjudica-

tion. The Vessel captured under an Imperial flag, had on board,
Subjectg of the Regency of Tri oli, one of which is the principal in the
Charter Party, and Owner o the
ter proportion of the Cargo,
destined for the port of Tripoli. ctisfy
Your Excellency, more
fully on the subject, if any doubts can remain; I have no objections to
shew the Papers of the said Vessel, to such of Your Principal Officers,
as you may think proper to order on board the United States frigate
Chesapeake. The papers will be sent to Gibraltar, and if the Admiralty Court of that place, will take Cognizance of the Capture; I shall
abide by their decision, whatever it may be. Should the Whole,
or any part of her Cargo be condemned; It is not in my power to
deprive the Captors of that profit which the laws of their Country
authorize. You may readily imagine that the Enemies of the United
States, would gladly, avail themselves of an opportunity, to engage
Your Excellency's interference, in their b e d ; mthout any respect to
truth, or consideration of the Consequences. But from Your Exc?'s
reputed good understanding; and the particular manifestations, of the
Government of the United States to preserve Peace and friendship
with Your Regency. I have no doubt but you will feel, a peculiar
pleasure in detecting the authors of this false and unfounded representation, and treating them with that severity which their base
designs merit. I also feel satisfied that Your Excellency will see the
propriety of cautioning your Subjects from having any mercantile
transacbons with the Enemies of the United States, particularly when
their Pork, may be in a state of Blockade. And also of withdrawing
Your determination to make reprisals, on the Commerce of the United
States, so that you may preserve that good understanding, which a t
present exists, between the Two Governments, and which the President of the United States is so desirous to continue.
I beg that a decisive answer may be given me as speedily as possible,
either, through the medium of the Consul for the United States, or
t,hough any other Channel, that may be most agreeable to yourself
And by which my conduct shall be regulated, until the same can be
communicated to the Government, which I have the honor to represent. And further, I beg leave to inform Your Excellency, that if the
Court of Admiralty at Gibraltar should adjudge, that the Cargo or any
part thereof should be restored to the former Owners, with Compensation for the detention; It shall be done without delay.

March 1803. This entry includes reference to 26 February 1803

At the Goletta lays moor'd the Enterprize Capt Sturett who was

16 days getting from Malta to Tunis. Of the Ruins of Carthage a t
this b t a n c e we can discern nothing, & were we to land there in order
to explore them, we should be immediately seized & marched off to

Tunis, or the Lord knows where. The Comr applied to the Bey for
ermission for the officers to Land & examine whatever is to be seen,
put wss refused. - The only way is to go on shore at Tunis & get the
Consul's droghoman, (a Bey's officer) to ride out with you. He would
be a sufEicient rotection against the insults or violence of the country
people. - T e Plain where Hanibal & Scipio fought was pointed
out to me by Mr Eaton in passing from the Ship to the Goulette.
When the Enterprize was in here formerly her boat with the Consul
& a number of officers with the droghoman landed a t Carthage.
The Wind coming on to Blow, the oficer of the Boat, Mr Galloway
then a Midshipman went off to the schooner to get a larger Boat:
on his Returning the Party had not come back from their Ramble:
they therefore waited & soon after a large Company of armed Turks
came down & were bearing him & Crew off in Triumph, when they
were met by a stronger Rabble & who took them from the others &
marched them to a quick step over hill & dale. The Consul & party
in the Mean time returned & discovering by means of the droghoman
their route, pursued & overtook them about 5 miles in the country,
when b dint of money & the help of the droghoman they procured
their re ease & came off. The money given amounted to 15 dollars.
(Here follows a list of "Dimensions of Guns at the Goulette Tunis.")
There are upward of 50 guns mounted in the Citadel about 30 foot
from the ground there we were not permitted to enter. the guns
show themselves out of ports in the same manner a ship shows her
Battery: these p n s appear to be badly mounted & in a bad state
having no tomlnncr &c &c and likewise appear to be of smaller Caliber
than those I have noted in the last
There is here likewise a famous
bein 15 ft 3 in. in length &
22 inches bore. from this they fire stone Ba s a number of which
were laying near, it is fixed in a bed of earth. & elevated at about 30
deg. It is split a t the muzzle & if it ever has been fired, I imagine it
never will be again, & is now kept here in terrorem for it is a wonderful
thing - From the observations I have made, the Comr ought not to
fear the result in lafig the American squadron in the Bay, alongside
of these works - provlded there is sufEcient water.
On the 26* FebrT the Comr, Capt Ro[d] era & many of the officers
went on shore a t Tunis in order to sett e in conjunction with the
Coneuls existing differences between the two Governments: The prize

taken by the Enterprize was one cause. The Be of Tunis claims a
part as Tunisian property: I n an interview the ey asked - "Why
did you take that vessel"? "Because it is agreeable to our Laws &
the Laws of Nations." - Bey. "I know no Laws of Nations"
Comr. "But we do & observe them, & we mean to make ourselves
respected as a Nation."
On the 5'P March they set out to come off to the Ship & had proceeded down to the landing place in Tunis - when the Com' was
detain'd by order of the Bey, the other officers being permitted to
come off. Capt Ro[d]gers & Consul Cathcart remained with the
Comr.
On the 6t@March the Comr came off & the great Joy testified on
Return, by the officers & Crew must have been grateful to his feelings. -

the evening we arriv'd in the Bay where we found a French *ate
whose Commander inform'd us, that the Dey of Algiers had not
declar'd War against France as we were inform'd a t Tunis that their
boat was on Shore in order to accommodate matters amicably if
possible, the Commodore order'd the Schooner to s t a ~ din Shore in
order to bring Mr O'Brien off in the Morning, thus will the Dey be
inform'd that Mr Eaton was sent away from Tunis, by the Bashaw
which will induce the Jews & Mr OBrien to ersist in persuading him
not to receive me as Consul who undoubt&y will quote this transaction as precedent & insist upon the same priviledge m Mr OBrien arrived on Board & remain'd one hour,

the Commodore with some papers the Contents of which
are to me unknown he gave me a letter which he said was an answer
to mine of the 25" Novembr it contain'd little but insolence which
I treated with silent contempt, its prominent features were the
dey's ositive refusal to receive me & Mr OBrien's wfusrtl to be
amena le for his Conduct to any authority but the Government of

the United States as he by no means considers himself superceeded
by me, it however merits an answer which he shall have by the first
Op ortunity a Copy of which shall be transmitted to the Department
of gtate he likewise furnish'd me with a List of the Consular presenta
deliver'd in 1798 In answer to the Commodore's interrogations Mr OBrien answer'd
that the Dey had refused the cash commutation, that it was deposited in h house that when the stores arrives there remains a
probability of his being persuaded to receive a part payment in cash
for the next years annuity, but even that, depended upon circumstances & added that the United States were in debt to the Jews
about twenty thousand dollars which must be immediately paid as
they were impatient for their money & continued he, the Dey is very
much displeas'd that the timber for ship building was not forwarded
ere now, as he is thereby prevented from kishing a Cruizer he has
on the stocks nearly ready to launch he again reiterated that the
dey would not receive me and observd that we had better not displease him as he was negociating a peace with Portugal which would
open him a passage into the western Ocean when he would prove a
terrible enemy to our Commerce "true amwer'd I & all the presents
we will ever give him, will not prevent his Cruising against us when
that takes place, but, he will never have it in his power, to act the
tragedy of 1793 again, so long as the United States has Vessels of
War to oppose his de redations
MF Eaton came on oard with Mr OBrien, when the latter declar'd
to the Commodore that several Months past some respectable sub'ects
of Tunis declar'd to him at Algiers that the Prime Minister of dunis
had solemnly protested that he would endeavour by every means in
his ower to effect the Ruin of Mr Eaton, this is at least presumptive
evi&nce that Mr Eaton has fallen a sacrifice to the Mmister's evil
Machinations & that the detention of the Commodore was premeditated not so much to procure the prompt payment of the debt as to
injure Mr Eaton's reputation & thereby more easily effect his expulsion
from that Regency

should I hazard an opinion on the subject it would be this, that so

proper to continue me in that post, it wo d facilitate my reception
to write to the Dey by the ship that brings the Stores for Algiers and
at the same time to write to the Jews to Stop Mr OBriens credit he
being no longer encharged with our affairs; I shall hare the Consular

"Mr. Cathcart wrote to Mr. Nissen, the Danish Consul st Tripoli,
that he was authorized to treat on terms of mutual reciprocity, with
the Bey of Tripoli; sta

. Cathcart's propositions, I beg leave to
For the particulars of
refer ou to the honorable Secretary of State. He d o r m s me he is
furnis ed with a copy of his letter to Mr. Nissen; they, however, were
rejected. But, Sir, as I am honored with the codidence of the government, to negotiate in their behalf, I shall use my utmost exertions to
bring about a reconciliation. At this period, howevert there appears
Bashaw,
to be some probability of the brother of the resent re-g
succeeding m raising an army to place himse on the throne. Should
that take place, and a treaty were formed with the resent Bashaw, it
would become invalid on the accession of the ot er. I have been
solicited by agents, or pretended agents, to cooperate with the brother
to dethrone the Bey. Their demands have been from 50,000 to 16,000
dollars; 10,000 stand of arms, powder, and some light field-pieces.
This I absolutely refused, but consented to bring the ships before
Tripoli in June, and to furnish 20 barrels of owder, on conhtion that
I could be satisfied, they had authority to d o + the United States, an
equivalent for their aid, in the event of success. Their answers were,
that we would be permitted to make a favorable treaty. I was by no
means satisfied with merely a pledge of those agents. Their word was
not a sufficient usrantee: and in the event of our renderin them
assistance, I shafl take care to have the advantage clearly e h e d ,
and as binding as the nature of the case will allow.
"While we lay in Malta, I received information of an Imperial
vessel, having Tripoline subjects on board with their property, constituting a principal part of the cargo, and bound to Tripoli. I
immediately dispatched the Enterprize on a cruise, with orders to
Captain Sterret, if he found the vessel circumstanced as was represented, to bring her into Malta. He fell in with her on the 17th, and
on the 18th brought her in. I applied to Sir Alexander Ball, Governor
of the Island, to permit the Court of Admiralty to try the prize; but
as there is no regular Court of Admiralty at that place, it could not
be decided there. The only place where I could then hope to have a
decision was at Gibraltar. Captain Sterret, was ordered to take the
Captain and Boatswain on board, together with the Moors; and some
of them claiming Tunis for their country, I requested him (if he found
it the case) to permit them to go on shore, and if the property (consisting of part of the cargo) was found to be theirs, after an investigation took place a t Gibraltar, he might promise them, it should be
returned. On my arrival at Tunis, I found the enclosed letter from
Mr. Eaton, in answer to which, the Bey was furnished with a letter;
the copy of which, I herewith have the honor to enclose you. The
procsedmgs whilst a t Turn, I have journalized. You will, I trust Sir,
approve of m conduct, under the circumstances I was placed in.
Compelled as was, to take Mr. Eaton out of Tunis, I considered Dr.
George Davis as the most proper
on to manage the Consular
affairs, until the government sho d be apprized of Mr. Eaton's
removal. Dr. Dams received lnstqctions from me, a copy of which is
enclosed. I cannot forbear (in jushce to m self, and the insult offered
to m country) to attribute the cause to &e duplicity of Mr. Eaton.

~hore,and particularly, that he had bound the United 8tatstes, by

placing their seal to the obligation given, I should not have put myself
m the power of the Bey of Tunis. Mr. Eaton's entreaties to prevail
on me to go on shore, and the secrecy the affair of his embarrassments
was kept m, together with his promise to Hadge Unis, the commercial
agent of the Bey, (the person the bond was given to) that I would
assume the debt on my arrival, (which I firmly believe Mr. Eaton did
promise,) strengthens my belief in his being accessory to my detention.
As a security for the money paid by me, I insisted on Mr. Eaton's
assigning all his real and personal estate to the govenrnent, which
transfer, together with an attested copy of the bond, will accompany
this.
"The apparent determination of the Northern Powers, to meet and
subscribe to all the demands of the Bey of Tunis, rather than risk a
war; furnishes in my mind, strong grounds to apprehend a rupture
with the United States. His cruisers are fitting out, and he has declared that he wiU not regard a blockaded port, and that he will
continue his commerce with Tripoli, and resort to reprisals, if any of
the vessels were taken or detained by our squadron. In fact, I conceive the Bey is alarmed, lest if the Bashaw of Tripoli should be
compelled to a peace, it might induce the tributary powers to attempt
the same measures with him; his ports are certainly more susceptible
of blockade than any other of the Barbary States. The menacing
conduct of the Bey of Tunis, with his declared desire of preferring
a war with us, I have no doubt will point out the necessity of encreasing
the squadron in the Mediterranean. A force is the only hope we can
have of continuing in peace with the Barbary States. They all appear
predisposed to be a t war: and should they commence hostdities, when
we are unprepared to meet them, (particularly as our merchant
vessels pay no regard to their safety,) it would cost millions to reclaim
our citizens, and bring about a negotiation. - You wiU readily
perceive, Sir, the necessity of employing the whole force, before Turns
and Algiers; and the disappointment of not having a supply of provisions, by the Constellation, obliged me to bring the whole squadron
to Gibraltar.
"These unavoidable circumstances, have left an opportunity for the
Tripolines to put to sea, and I am extremely apprehensive, they will
do some mischief to our merchant-men, before we can get on the
coast of Tripoli.
"The John Adams, and Adams, shall be dispatched as soon as possible, with convoy; and the New-York will proceed direct, if there
should not be any American vessels wanting protection; if on the
contrary, it shall be afforded. As soon as the Enterprize is manned,
she shall be employed to the best advantage in my power. Our
unsettled state with Morocco, has induced me to detain the Adams,
until the period of the term of the enlistment of the people, is expired.
Your letter bearing date October 23d, 1802, was not received until the
4th January. Had your letter above alluded to, come to hand before,
it would have been extremely hazardous to send the Chesa eak on the
coast in the winter season. She is decayed, works, an is still an
uneasy sea-boat.
"Captain Barron delivered the 30,000 dollars, to Mr. O'Brien, on
his passage to Malta, intended for the Dey of Algiers. Mr. O'Brien's
communications I have enclosed, they will serve to make you acquainted with the Dey's determination.

I directed Captain Stemt, to keep close to the town, and a t d a x h i
to make the signal for Mr. O'Brien. At 12 o'clock, on the 20th, he
brought him onboard the Clheeapeak. I then enquired of Mr. O'Brien,
if the Dey had consented to receive the cash, instead of stores. He
informed me, the Dey positively refused to accept of any other mode
of ayment than that expressed by treaty. In consequence of this
de aration of the Dey, I wrote to him (the contents I have thehonor
to enclose) and re uired Mr. OJBrien to return the $30,000. He
! e would permit him to re-ship it, which he very
said he would, if theD
much doubted. I told h r . O'Brien, I did not conceive the Deg had a

not get the money. The Emperor of Morocco has furnished the late
Tripoline ship wzth papers, and claims her as his property; as such
has demanded the Consular assports, and they were furnished.
They, with the Emperor's cert' cafe, have been presented to me, and
I have consented to regard her as the property of the Emperor of
Morocco, and romised to let her depart unmolested. A copy of the

To Richard O'Brien, U. 6. Consul General, Algiers, from B e c r e w of State

DEPARTMENT
OF STATE
30 March 1803
SIR, The Secretary of the Navy, to whose Department the transmission of the Articles for Algiers has lately been transferred has given
orders for collecting the maritime stores and other articles, the lists
of which you have transmitted, with the exception only of the powder,
on which as there would be a loss of two or three Cent p' Cent i t is
not believed that the occasion demands such a sacrifice, especially as
the money in your possession, if ultimately accepted on the annuity,
the stores &c above alluded to, the Consular and biennial presents,
which are soon to be made, ought sufEciently to gratify the Deys
ectations from our liberality: a t least the urgency rn not con:%red so critical as to preclude the delay necessary for endeavours to
repel the demand.
I t may be proper here to recall to your recollection some circumstances, which may account for the omission till now of efEectual
measures for collecting and forwarding those stores. They may
tend a t once to give you proper impressions and allay the suspicions
and impatience of the Dey. When the present administration succeeded to the management of the public interests, they found our relations with the Barbary Regencies in an alarming situation, all of them
openly menacing our eace, and Algiers and Tunis founding their
&ssatisfaction upon t e large arrearages due and withheld from
them. To the latter all her dues were soon aid up, and to the former,
we have given satisfaction, except as to t e last year's annuity, for

1

g

386

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1803 TO 1803

which we sent the same sum of money that had contented her the year
before, but which she has not now thought proper to accept. A
more reasonable expectation could not have been entertained than
that her conduct would have been the reverse of what you inform me
it is, both as to the refusal of the cash in pa ent of the annuity and
her peremptory requisition of stores grea y exceeding in value the
arrearage. If our punctuality instead of producing a harmonizing
temper becomes a temptation to extort more than justice admits,
there will be little encouragement to that line of policy towards the
Dey.
My letter of the lot, May last must have been misunderstood, if
it could be construed to withdraw the small pension you allow your
Mother out of your salary. I have ordered the only draft that since
appeared from her to be paid.
To satisfy the debt due to the Jews, cash is preferable to goods.
If other motives to this preference were wanting, it would be sufficient
to recall to view the expence and trouble incurred in procuring the
extraordinary articles forwarded in the [George] Wmhingtm on her
last trip, which were then rare, and are now unsaleable, and which
they have returned without as&gbg. any reason. You will be
pleased to claim a credit from them (whch they are bound in writing
to admit) equal to the insurance paid upon the Articles they received
in the Sophia and the Wmhingtm on her first voyage to Algiers.
The inclosed certificate from the Purveyor, which, from its date,
you will perceive, was intended to be transmitted long ago, will serve
to ascertain the amount of the credit.
The President in compliance with the usage which admits of the
refusal of a Consul on qounds peculiar to the person, will shortly
appoint another for Alpen to succeed you. He will no doubt be
sent out without delay, and with all the requisite instructions for
substituting his responsibility on the public account for yours. It
is also intended that he shall carry out topa and samples of the new
assports, which are to supercede those now in use, after a sdEcient
apse of time from our hearing of their being distributed on the coaat
of Barbary to enable all the vessels of the United States to be supplied
with them.
There are several other subjects in your latest letters (some of them
personal) requiring answers, which shall be duly attended to.

would have to encounter should he attempt a negotiation with
Tripoli without a faithful co-adjutor unacquamted as he is with the
language customs & manner of negotiating with Barbarians, I quoted
the embarrassing situation he had just emerged from a t Tunis on the
first moment he had ever landed in m y of the Barbary States, I infom'd him that the Bashaw would employ those who were entirely
devoted to his interest who would endeavor to take advantage of h s
ignorance of their situation & placed in a striking point of view the
probability of his being deceiv'd in a manner sirmlar to the Swedish
Comodore Tornquist in 1801 already detail'd to government, neither
did I omit mentioning how extremely trifiing it would appear to government when they would be inform'd that he had taken me all
round the mediterranean without giving me an op ortunity of puting
into execution any part of my instructions, the omodore answer'd
that he had receiv'd instrucbons that superceded mine & as I had
furnished him with a copy of the Treaty which I had drawn out he
could do without me & again repeated that he would send for me
should he want my assistance The clause in my instructions of the 22'q of August 1802 which
providea for contingencys to rn If is by no means applicable under
the present circumstances, for have literally nothing to do here, the

A ent, the Dey of Algiera instigated by the intrigues of the Jews coa8uted by M' OBrien has refused to receive me & awaits the Presidents answer on the subject which will cause a delay of some months
during which time it was my duty as it was my inclination to have
proceeded before Tripoli & to have at least made an attempt to commence a ne otiation with that Regency; I declare I cannot account for
our Como ores conduct in any way but by supposing that he intends to spend the summer in inactivity & occasionally give convoy,
or is jealous lest my presence a t the negotiation might diminish his
share of the glory atchieved by its success; if the former it no doubt
w i l l meet the attention of government as i t merits, if the latter I most
sincerely hope that his exertions may be crown'd with a success equal
to his most sanguine expectations
I saild from Gibraltar on board the Adams 011 the 7t!' of April with
a convoy of seven sail, touch'd a t Malaga Alicant & Barcelona, &
arrived m the road of Leghorn on the 2gtQ& in addition to the many
mortifications which I receiv'd since my departure from this place
(on the 3'9 of laat November) I was sentenced to a Quarantine of
fourteen days, I cant help expressing myself extremely grateful to
CaptWampbell for the very polite & hospitable treatment I receiv'd
whlle onboard the Adams happy should I be could I extend the same
acknowledgment to Comodore Morris, but as every Officer onboard
the Chesapeake knows I cannot with propriety, I must request that
should he make any charge to government for my table, that he may
be refer'd to me for payment, as it is well known, that I am neither
in arrears to him in pohteness or hospitality The money mentioned by Comodore Morris is six thousand dolltars
which I advanced him at Malta for the use of the Squadron a dollar
being worth there 5' 2d sterling & a t Leghorn only 4' €id consequently
by my taking his bills upon this place it has saved the United States
8d on each dollar which ammounts on the above sum to $888 88/100
Enclosed with this is the copy of the Treaty which I left with Comodore Morris with a literal translation in Italian should he send for me
I will immediately obey the summons if not I will remain stationary
until I receive the Presidents further orders Permit me the honor to subscribe myself with the greatest respect
& esteem -

[Malta] Thirty& days have elapsed - C I have not had time to
continue my journal. however let me return chnd give an account of
a dreadful accident which happen'd off the South end of Sardinia.
I will give the extract from the Lo Book.
"April 25* At 8 A. M.we were armed by an explosionofpowderin
the cockpit: Beat fo Quarters and dirscover'd that the accident had
happen'd in the Gllnners Store Room situated in the Cockpit and not
far from the Powder Magazine: The consternation among the people
was great, but soon ranks were form'd & those in the Cockpit supphed
with water, wet blankets, swabs &c - & the fire was exbguish'd in
one hour & an half: The BoaB were hoisted out on the first alarm, k
the signal of distress made. Found very considerable damage done.
The Gunners Stores almost entirely consum'd Pursers Slops, Marine
Cloatbing, & Hos itd Stores reciev'd considerable damqe, amount
not yet sscertain'g - But the greatest misfortune is the mjury done
to those in the cockpit at the moment of explosion: a number of whom
are so sbockingl burnt that their lives are despair'd of. Their
names are aa fo ows: Mr Richard M o d , Gunner who was in the
Store Room at the time, Mr Alexis midshipman & MF Lewis do - both
on the Ladder over the Cockpit on the birth deck, Mr Weems, Sureon'a Mate, Mr John Shulta Corn':' Secre
Mc James Jennison
apt's Clerk, Mr Kennedy Pursem Stewardq 4 MPGee m a k e Centinel at the Msgazine Psasage David Hamilton Loblolly Boy - All
in the Cockpit at the time. It appears from the Gunner's Account,
that early in the morning as is usual he had directed John Stsines
gunner's mate to return the signal lantherns to the Store room & that
he (the Gunner) going into the storeroom soon after to see every th@g
in its proper place, found that Staines had left a candle there whch
he extrnguished & cane on deck to reprimand his mate for such carelessness: not yet satisfied that d was safe he returned to the Store
room to examme it & by removing some sheep skins he observed some
sparks of fire which fell out of them into a Bucket that containJd
some damaged powder prepar'd for smoking the birth deck, from them
it commu~llcatedto the Powder Horns hanging up in the Store room
$ by the explosion of them & the damaged powder the bulk head of
the Marine store room burst & it communicated to about 37 dozen
Mmk cartridges thereinJ' Here hishes the Recital as pr the LogBook, but I will furnish a few remarks such as do not come w i h
compass of a Log-Book description: We were in the utmost danger of
blowin up as the door opening to the Magazine passage was bursted.
In the ardroom the? is a scuttle for the purpose of passing up cartridges in time of acbon, t h scuttle was lifted & another p
opened by the explosion, otherwise it is the opinion of all that we sho d
have been lost, for the exp10sion would have burst tbe only remaining
door into the filling room: here there are always an hundred or two
of artridges ready £illed: This explosion would momently have been
followed by the rn sine & then adieu. MT M o d , M' hulte, Mr ~ennison& David Earnilton have dl
since died, but the others y e in 8 fair way of recovery. On the 19 of May we m v ' d here. There are now at Vdetta an

not give me but little information, a t that time, untill he went to the

and New-Copper her from light water mark, to the bottom of her keel Tomorrow I shall remove her from her present moorings to a wharf,
where I intend to heave her down, and shall have her in readiness for
that Operation by the time M' Brown can learn from you, what
copper he is to supply me with: that made by MI Revere, is good,
and of proper thickness - if it was not necessary to heave down and
copper I could have her ready for Sea in three weeks, but as she is
situated a t present (no preparation having been made for heaving
down except the making of careening blocks) it will be an expensive
business, and will detain her some time longer in port I think it probable I can have her got ready for sea in 7 or 8 weeks
at farthest taking the chance of weather, probably I may have her
ready sooner: her hull is in excellent Order, excepting the bottom,
and a few days work for the Joiners, to complete the hanging Magazine forward, and finishing the boatswains, Gunners & Carpenters
store rooms, and cleat
for the hammocks, the masts & spars rig
and sails are in good or er for sea service - a few spare spars X b :
wanted, and the necessary sea supplies in the Different Departments
previous to sailing - her Guns are at Castle Island, I have Ordered
them to be brought here directly as I shall want them in heaving
down, the Gun Carriages are in tolerable good Order, hands will be
employ'd tomorrow to take them from the Sheds to examine them
particularly & paint them I believe from report, that the powder and other Military Stores
require the immediate attention of a Gunner I have not had time to
examine, but shall as soon as I conveniently can - Two or three new
new cables will be necessary - As soon as I have opportunity to
make further examination I shall make report - A Carpenter is wanted for the Ship -and I believe Oconomicd to attach a purser to her I request you to permit me to engage a CaptP Clerk for the Constitution as I am much in want of one - Lieuto Blake & Tarbell & Midshi men D.

1. Commodore Morris tlrrived before Tripoli in the U S Frigate
New York May 22sd 1803.
2sd Commodore Morris left the station June 10Q 1803. having
remained 19 days before Tripoli, 6 of which were employed in negotiation with the Bey.
3. At 5 P M, May 28Q 1803 the New York, (Commodore M) being
2 or 3 miles ahead of the Squadron, and a very light breeze, 9 Gun
boats of the enemy, and a large Zebec, were discovered, in shore of us.
The Commodore made a signal for the John Adam, to make sail she had every thing then set that could be of any advantage, but one
lower steering sail, which was instant1 set. The wind still decreasing & not comeing up with the New ork, the Commodore, h x too,
with his Main Top sail aback, & made the signal for the John Adums,
to lead the Van; she accordingly passed the New Ywk & commenced
the action on the Gun boats, Zebec & Forts. The Commodore took
a osition, about 3 or 4 Cables length, on the weather bow of the
o n Adums, & fired 2 or 3 broad sides, after which no report was
heard from his battery. The John A
h continued firing untill
darlmess prevented objects from being distinguished. The Forts &
Gun boats kept a constant fire. The John Adum remained, on the
scene of action all night. In the morning the Commodore, with the
remainder of his Squadron were about 11 or 12 miles distance to the
Northward & Westward.
4 It was currently reported Commodore Morris disapproved of the
capture of the Mmshouda, and said that, to Cap't Rodgers should be
attached the bkcme, and expence. Mr Alline, Purser of the John
Adam can probably authent~catethis report.

facts contained in the answers to your questions, to the log book of
the John Adurns and a copy of Cap't Rodgers journal. Both these

probably afford you many more awjul testimonies, against the conduct of Commodore Morris - It would be more agreeable to me,
that those records should be quoted as your authority, than my

NAVYDEPM? May h'4*@1803 Captain Bainbridge having been directed to assume the command
of the Frigate Philadelyhia and prepare her for sea with all possible
dispatch, will necessarily be too much occupied in the execution of
these instructions to continue the superintendency of the Brig Siren
to advantage. It has, therefore, been deemed proper to relieve him
from that business, and to direct you to supply his place. You will accordingly undertake to superintend the building of the
Siren, of which vessel you are to have the command as you have
been heretofore advised. As a deviation from the plans which have been devised by Cap!
Bainbridge in building this vessel, might retard her preparation,
occasion considerable additional expence, and possibI might produce
no essential advantage, you will communicate free y with Captain
Bainbridge in every stage of your progress where i t may be necessary,
and pursue the arrangements he has made; and in short, you wlll
take up the business where he may leave it, and make no alteration;
a t least without obtaining my previous sanction to it. Your letter of the 20t@with the accompanying model of a carriage
for a Carronade, I have received. I t will ever afford me a high degree
of happiness to perceive such manifestations of zeal in an officer to
introduce improvements into the Navy of the United States. The
use of Carronades, and especially in small vessels I have much approved, and my only objection to them has been their imperfect
Slides or Carriages. Being pleased with the plan which you have
proposed, I am willing that you make the experiment & that the
Carriages for the Carronades of the Siren, be made according to the
model you have sent to me, with such further improvements as may
suggest themselves to you. But every variation from the model
you have sent, you will, without delay, communicate to me. The followin officers have been ordered to join the Siren. Lieutg

truly sensible of the honor the President has conferred on me by committing to my direction the command of the Squadron destined for
the Mideteranean service. I am fully aware of the great trust, and
high responsibilit connected with this appointment, and altho I may
err in judgment rom a want of talents and experience, for so important Station, yet he may rest assured that I never shall from a want
of Zeal for the Public service. The honor of the American Flag is
very dear to me, and I hope it will never be tarnished under my
command - I beg you to accept my thanks for the gratefull manner
in which you have communicated the appointment to me, and to be
assured it will ever be my pride to endeavor to deserve the good
Opinion you profess to entertain of me I a m making progress in preparing the Constitution for heaving
down - her stores and equip e are preparing and putting in Order,
she is now sufficiently rigged or careening, but we shall be obhged
to wait until some time next week for Capsterns and Hulks to be
prepared.
I presume that the ship will be ready to receive her men in three
Weeks from this, and as the are scarce it will be well to open a
rendezvous for recruiting by t at time I have not yet seen her powder, but as it has not been turned, or
moved for nearly two years, and was in bad Order when landed, it
is robably all spoiled, and fresh powder will be Necessary
beus Tarbell is not yet here, he was in the district of Main when
I ordered him to join the Ship. I expect him in a day or two, Neither
of the Midshipmen I ordered have yet appeared, they are momently
expected.
I experience the want of Officers to attend to the Different Departmenta - If I am to take 9 Pounders for the Brig [Argus] in lieu of
Camnades, the Carriages will want repairing - It will be well for
the Officerwho is to command the Brig to be here as soon as is convenient, he will find full employ in attending to the Mechanicks
employ'd about her - my time is ve much engaged in attending
be some time hence - She
to the Constitution a t resent, and
will want two or three oats: The Brig will be afloat by the time contemplated, a Purser and Gunner are much wanted for the Ship [LC. ,EPP, LB, 1803.1

seen, whereas we being in their western horizon made an excellent mark
for them: We haul'd close to the wind & ceaa'd firing, standing off
the land: it was almost calm, the shi going about 1 mile per hour:
Now had their Gun boats been manned y Americans, they would have
rowed out & completely wrecked our three ships, for had they come
within half a mile we could only have seen them when them guns
flash'd: the moon shining against our sails & the light from our gun
deck afforded them a sure mark a t the distance of one mile. a t eight

[ever] We have been all day sailing off & on just in sight of Tripoly.
About noon we discovered two boats running along shore towards
, being 10 or 12 miles to the westward of the town. Signal
made or the squadron to chase: these fellows too escap'd us and got
in to port: whether they were gun boats or not we could not ascertain
for we never came near enough to see their hulls.
I had the morning watch this morning & as the day dawned I
anxiously looked toward the spot where last ni ht's action took place.
Nothing was there: but just at the mouth of t e harbor we saw some
of the gun boats: the ship they have probally towed in. -

We were inform'd that the consul had made communications to the
Bey, who answer'd that as he had not reciev'd direct communications
himself from the American Comr he had nothing to sa - observing
haughtily that were the Rock of Gibraltar abreast o him he knew
how to difend himself. He very obligingly told the Consul that he
was at Liberty to send us fresh provisions - the Comr declin'd recieving any. The Comr wrote a letter to the Bey, & the Boat return'd
to Tripoly. Capt Hull politely offer'd to tow the Boat in near to
the City which the Tripoline gentry did not accept: We were inform'd

Carronade when discbar ed permit me to observe from all the observation I have made am fully persuaded that she is as secure
(if not more so) than any plan that has as yet sugested itself to me,
for this reason: the rid e on the bed haveing a good hold of both
sides of the Carria e & rom end to end must consequently render it
more firmly attac ed to the bed than the partial hold which the
center bolt has of its carriage in the usual plan: But! should your
apprehensions on experiment prove correct the center bolt can easily
then be added.

sail of small craft in a small bay, that the Adam lay watching them
& kept firing now & then to keep them from unlading. Cargoes wheat:
none of them were more than 25 tons nor less than 12 or 15. At 5
P. M we anchor'd in company with the Adurns - one short mile from
the Shore. The Boats were all aground. Four of their Skippers
had come off to the Adums, saying they were Tuniseans: the Comr sent
them this Notice to haul their boats off along side of us, before 12
oclock or we would burn them. Our Boats were order'd to Row Guard
& at 8 oclock, but I am too fast - let me return - all the afternoon
there were about 1000 people about on different ernininces. Some
on Arabian horses - riding full s eed flourishing their guns over their
heads & cutting Capers The A m now & then giving them a shot
for Amusement. On the banks just where the Boats were grounded
was a stone house, built something like a fortification. At 8 oclock

and a air of pistols, with the first Lieutnt M' Porter & Mr. Wadsworth h d q put off from the ship, we call'd along side of the Enterprize

come near, one in particular on a Black steed, flourishing his carbine

of the enemy are killed. But we did not accomplish our object full :
for the cargoes must in a great measure remain uninjured. At 11 t e
squadron weighed anchor and made sail.The Comr says there were several Thousand on shore collected
behind the different eminences, & only waiting for us to land - to
make a general attack on all sides & cut us off at once: he sup oses that
there were one thousand cavalry: I form'd an opinion, at e time of
the Attack from the Number of heads popping up from behind the
Mounds & hillocks: the stone house &c kc, that there were about
one thousand in all. I give you the Come*opinion & perhaps it is
more correct than my own for after we made sail & left them, they
began to muster out of their hiding places & throw the sand in the am
by handfuls in defiance.
The Adam8 threw her shot excellently well, whenever three or four
were seen running together she would throw s twelve pounder Br. if they
were not cut down, the sand would so cover them that for a minufe

TRIPOLIdt@June 1805.
Dt SIR. The gtQ UltQtwo Bmerican Frigates & a schooner appear'd
again before Tripoli, a few days after the Bashaws Frigate which
was at Gibraltar was intercepted going to Tripoli; the Emperor of
Morocco (having as it is said) obtain'd assports from the minister
of the United States at Lisbon & their 8onsul at Tangiers had sent
the Frigate to Tripoli with a moorish crew; having on board the
guns of the other cruiser which was sold at Gibraltar. Their has been several canondings between the Frigates the Forts
& the Gunboats but to no effect on the 27tQenter'd a Xebeck of 14
Guns under the cover of the boats not withstanding the fire-of the
Frigates & the Schooner the night being advanced & the Shlps not
being able to approach the batteries. - Of the three Cruisers that
are still absent two are safe in the Levant & the other is supposed to
h v e been lost a few days after her departure from Tripoh. - On
the 2gt@Ultq the Schooner demanded by signal a boat from the
shore; the Bashaw sent to me to know the meaning of .the signal
which I having told to Sacy his Excellency answer'd by h m that he
had nothing to correspond about, but had orderd a boat to be ready
for my use, that I might write what I pleased, but only to add that
in case the Americans wish'd for any fresh revisions I should have
leave to send off whatever they askd for. - likewise sent an answer
to Ca 9 Rodgers of the John Adams, who a few days before had wrote
me a etter re uesting me to communicate to the Bashaw his wishes
of preventing$ostilities by an Amicable arrangement, the Bashaw
answer'd in high words declaring that if the Comodore wrote to him
he woud answer him. The boat return'd in the evening with a letter from the Comodore
to the Bashaw, which I have not seen it is said to be wrote in french
& to contain propositions of Peace, the Bashaw intended to have
sent his answer the 31" but the Americans were too fa-r off & did not

f

P

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1808 TO 1803
observe my flag. - This day a boat was sent out with the answer
440

which has not been shewn to me but is to contain that the Bashaw
is not adverse to peace that the Americans m' ht send some body on
shore to negotiate with him, & it is reportedl%
ere that the Bashaws
demands are five hundred thousand dollars, ou no doubt will be
inform'd of the contenti3 of the Comodores etter & the Bashaws
answer better than I am. But give me leave my Dr Sir candidly to observe that Tripoli this
year is well provided with provisions b a rich harvest here are
plenty of E ~ o p e a ngoods by the aniv of several ships,* & the
Bashaw havlng the Swedish money has wherewith to maintain his
people & defray his expences. He certainly will not declare War against Holland before he concludes s peace with the United States, but will extort sums from their
Consul if their presents & ships of war remain absent. - Under such
circumstances it seems Sir that a simple blockade is as expensive as
useless & that our navigation is not secure was seen last year! It
must of course e by other means that the United States of America
must endeavor to en age the Bashaw to a Peace & I can never believe
that you will subscri e to his terms, I a m very sorry that the moment
so favorable pass'd last year; now that I have nothing to write to the
Commanders of the American Ships of War the Bashaw desires me
always to send letters he knows their is nothing usefull to commu~llcate.* - what a glorious blockade [NA. SDA. CL, Tripoli, Vol. 2, June 1801-Sept. 1806.1

it a secret. They are anxious for peace. - When Capt Rodgers first
came off Tripoly in the beginning of Ma ,he ran w i t h half gun shot
of the town & fired over it & into it: the atteries open'd upon him but
it is d%cult to hit a ship under brisk way. These shot went t h o ' the

90* June 1803. Copy. DEARSIRI have received your favour of the 19th last Month, with
advice of His Imperial Majestys Ship Meshoudu having been detained
by Captain Ro[d] ers, when attempting to enter the Port of Trip01 ,
and conducted toghlalta. - At receipt of your Letter I immediate y
waited on our Governour Alcayde Hashash, with a heavy complaint
against Raiz Omar, not only for havin taken in the Stores and
Passengers you mention at Algeirs, but so for the attempt he had
made to enter a blockaded Port. - Even after a long conversation
he could not be made fully to believe that Omar could have committed
such a mad Action, and so diametricsly opposite to the Instructions
he had given him, by His Majestys Command. No other information besides yours, on the subject, has yet reached
this, which I did not fail of insuting on being perfectly correct, the
Alcayde then declared in the strongest language that on that appearing in the se uel to be the case Omar should lose his head; he even
desired I wo,?l d request of you to send him here in Irons, that I told
him was a thing we could not do, but that he might give his Orders
to the second in Command, or any other person on board the Ship. The conduct of Omar having been thus disavowed by this Government, and in which they will certainly persist, I hope you will as you
say liberate the Ship. - I am persuaded the Orders the Governour
transmits by this conveyance, are such as will prevent whoever may
command her henceforward from attempting a second time to enter
Tripoly. - If we view the conduct of the Emperour as taking this
Ship under his Flag for the special purpose of restoring her to our
Enemy, it must be considered unfriendly in the extreme, but it was
impossible to avoid according with his Requisition in the first Instance,
and now she is under his Flag by the latter clause of the third Article
of our Treaty with him, we are bound to let whatever may be on
board of her pass free. Entrance into blockaded Ports I was specialy carefull to restrain
by the Passport given for the Medun&, as that has been violated we
are to consider what has been the conduct towards other Vessels in
same prediccament since the blockade of Tripoly has existed, I
believe it has been to turn them away on the first attempt; if that
has been the case the Emperour would certainly consider it hard to
have a Sbip under his Flag and claimed as his own property dealt
with in a different manner.
Whilst I thus express my hopes that
the Medmda w i l l be liberated, I must confees that the cucumstances
of her cam wear an aspect of the
est aggravation, but as undoubtedly the Interest the the U~ited tstes have in maintaining Peace
with the Barbary Powers, is particularly applicable to Morocco, I
persuade myself you will see the g o d polic of making a sacrifice
even of this moment for that effect. - h a t e v e r may be your

determination I have to entreat you will forward to me as exact an
Account as you xnq be able to form of the Stores laden on the
Meshoudu at Algiers, and attempted to be introduced into Tripoly,
that I may be fully repared to substantiate the necessary proofs on
the occasion, to be aid before His Majesty in Justification of the
detention of the Ship Exertions are actually makeing for sending out as soon as possible
the Ship sailed from Larach in August last, and the two Gall~esfrom
Tetuan, one of the Sall6 Ships may be ready in about a Month hence,
but the other I believe cannot go to Sea this Summer. - An American
Brig lately brought some Spars - S d s , Cables and other Stores for
these last, from Mogadore, and landed them at Sallb. - It would
be very satisfactory to me to be enabled by you, to testify to EIis
Majesty your havlng in behalf of the Government of the United
States even His Majesty a proof of their Freindship in pardoning the
Crime unputed to the Commander of the MeshowEa. Mrq Simpson 'oins me in best respects to Mr* Morris and your

UNITEDSTATES'FRIGATE New-Ywk,
Potomac, December &h, 1805.
SIR-I have the honor to make you acquainted with the particulars
relative to the destruction of the Bashaw of Tripoli's largest cruiser
by refening you to the following extract from my journal:
On the evening of the 21st of June last, owing to some extraordinary
movements of the gun boats in the harbor of Tripoli, I was induced
to conceive that the Bashaw either intended to send some cruisers to
sea during the night, or that he had received intelligence of some
bound in. I therefore, accordingly made such disposition of the vessels
engaged in the blockade, as to enable us to intercept either, by stationing the Adam, captain Campbell, to the westward, the schooner
Enterprize, lieutenant Hull, to the eastward, and remaining myself,
with the John A h , abreast of the town; and a t half past 7, A. M.
on the following da , Tripoli, bearing W. S. W. distance three or four
leagues observed J e E n t e r e z e in the S. S. E. with a signal flying
its *cation
not distingmshable; made sail and stood towards her:
a t 8 o. spoke the Entarprize, when lieutenant Hull informed me that
a large ship of the enemy, was anchored close in with the beach.
At half past 8, A. M. shortened sail and prepared to anchor, with
springs on our cables, discovering that the enemy was anchored, with

s rings on his cables, in a deep narrow bay, about 5 or 6 l e m e s to
&e eastward of the town, and in a situation, very advantageous to the
defence of their ship. At the same time, observed, nine gun boats,
close in with the shore, coming to her assistance, and a vast number
and armed men on the beach. [For further details see
Of
Captain odger's letter of 30 June 1803.1 All the men who returned
to the ship, were blown up in her, and I have reaeon to believe her
captain was among the number, as well as man lives lost before they
abandoned her, as we saw severd shot holes tK,ough her. Immedlately after the ship blew up, I ordered the signal made to chase the
gun boats, but was not able to approach them within gun shot, owing
to the water being very shoal a great distance seaward of them.

SIB The Squadron having this moment arrived from the Coast of
~ r i ~ o Ii itake
,
the earliest opportunity to inform you in what manner
they were employed during your absence, and whch I hope may meet
your approbation. Previous to the Return of the Enterprize from
Malta, the John Adams was stationed to the Eastward of the Town,
and Adams to the Westward, st such distance as to enable us to

distinguish each others signals,and join our opperations if it had been
necessary. - after the Enterprizes return she was stationed to the
Eastward and John Adams in the Centre abreast of the Town, and in
justice to Captain Campbell and Lieu*Hull, permit me to observe that
their vigil an^ could not be excelled, of course such as to merit y o u
Commendation, however, the Enem having only two Cruizers a t sea,
and those ioPort so close1 wstchdthat noof importance after
your departure transpiref except the Deatructaon of the Bashaws
h e s t Cruizer, for the particulars of which I refer you to the following
Extract from my Journal. On the 22q instant, a t 4 past 7 AM. Wind ENE. the Town of
Tripoli bearing WSW. distant 6 or 7 leagues, observed the Entereze in
the SSE. with a signal flying, its signification not distingushable,
made a d , and stood toward her, At 8 ditto, spoke the Enterprize
when Lieu8 Hull informed me that a large ship of the Enemy had
anchored close in with the shore, at 4 past 8 ditto, shortened sail and
pre ared to Anchor with Springs on our Cable, discovering the Enemy
anc ored with Springs on his Cable in a deep N-w
Bay, about 7 or 8
leagues to the Eastward of the Town, in a sltuabon advantageous to
defending their Ship, at the same time observed the Gun Boats beating
up to their assistance, and s vset number of Cavalry and Armed men
on the Beach, At 7 Minutes before 9 AM, being in 7 fathoms Water

g

and supposing we were within Point Blank shot of the Enemy Commenced &ing which they returned, and a Constant fire was maintained
for forty five Minutes, when the Enemy's f m was silenced, a t which
instant the Crew abandoned the Ship in the most Confused and
precipitate manner, for such as her Boats could not carry, jumped
overboard and swam to the shore, At this moment being in a less 5
fathoms Water, and the Rocks appearing under our Bottom and in
every direction round us, I thought it prudent to Ware and lay the
Ships head off shore, and in the meantime ordered Lieu$Hull to stand
as close in as Consistent with safety and amuse the Enemy on the
Beach, until our Boats could be holsted out to take possession, At
f. before 10 A M, Discovering one of the Enemy's Boats returning to
the Ship (whilst in the act of hoisting out our Boats) tacked and
renewed our fire, and in a few Minutes after had the Satisfaction to see
the Enemy's colors hauled down, at the same time, h g both their
Broadsides, which was accompanied b the Ships Blowing up with a
Heavy explosion, which Burst the Hul to pieces and forced the Main
and Mizen Masts perpendicularly into the air 150 or 160 feet, with all
the Yards Shrouds Stays $ 9 belonging to them. - This Ship was
Polacre Rigged Mounting 22 Guns, the largest Cruizer belongmg to
Tripoli, and to appearance a very fine vessel. From the number of
Persons I saw land her Crew must have consisted of more than 200
Men, and from the advantageous position she held, added to the Shoalness of Water outside of her, she ought to have annoyed us ve much
and have done very considerable damage, yet to the disgrace of%rli,
we have received no injury. - all the Men which returned to the hip
in the Boat were blown up in her, and I have reason to believe her
Captain was among the Number; Several Men which were wounded
on the Beach, were seen to be carried off b others, and a vast number
must have been Killed previous to their a andoning the Ship. Agreeable to our orders I left the Station on the 26t!' instant, a t
which time the ashaw had only one Cruizer at Sea, a small Latteen
Rigged Boat, and she I have been informed was Cruizing in the Gulf
of Venice, so that I conceive there is not much to be apprehended
from her. - I was close in with the Town the day before I left the
Coast, and all the Cruizers appear to be much in the same inactive
state as when you quit the station. - The loss of his most valuable
Cruizer must of Course do him great injury, and from appearances I
am in hopes that none of our Merchant vessels will fall into their hands
this Summer,
N. B. The destruction of the before mentioned vessel, altho'
awful, was one of the Grandest Spectacles I ever beheld. - After a
Tremendous Explosion there appeared a Huge Column of smoke, with
a Pyramid of Fme darting Vertically through its Centre interspersed
with Masts, Yards, Sails Rigging, different parts of the Hull &c and
the vessel in an instant dashed to Attoms. [LC. John Rodgera &others, Let. & Doc., 1799-1848, Ac. 2647.1

I am well aware that the circumstances of the Mesh&

justify Commodore Morris going to eve rigour with her, were the
Ship under the Flag of any Power by w om the Law of Nations is
observed, but I conclude he made a distinction when in his Letter to
me he says, "she shall not be Condemned if proved that this was not the
"Order of the Emperour. It is however expected that the
"Captain will be severely unished if it is an Act of his own."
I t was upon this princip e and not from any sense of Justice on their

liberated: - er Condemnation I am fully persuaded wo d give the
highest dis t to the Emperour, on the contrary its my oppinion her
release wo d afford me, after what has happened, a happy opportunity of makeing a strong impression on his Majestys mmd of the
Friendly intentions of the Government of the United States towards
him. - At this critical moment when the Emperours Cruizers are
so nearly ready for Service, I confess I could wish to see some one or
more Vessels of War of the United States in this Neighborhood, to
remain untill the fate of the Meshowla be known; for our Governour
having the sole direction of the Larach Ship and Tetuan Galleys,
might give trouble if she be not liberated. - The best security against

sailing instructions, for the disbursements of the squadron, I have
thought it proper to send you a sum of money, and I have accordingly
this day b c t e d you a remittance of Twent five thousand dollars.
This sum you will distribute among the vesse s under your command
as their necessities may require. - In all cases where you pay any
portion of it away, you will take recei ts as necwwy vouchers m the
settlement of your account with this epartment. If the Carronades for the Constitution and Brig Argw cannot be
procured a t Boston, you may take out of any of the returning vessels,
all that they have of a suitable kind and purchase the residue in the
Mediterranean, if you should be abie to do it on reasonable terms:
For this purpose you are a t Liberty to use a sufficiency of the sum
this day remitted to you although I had rather you would draw on
me f6r the amount should you be able to do it to advantage. When you do buy, advise me of the purchase and terms.-

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1802 TO 1803

The connexions of Midsg Wg Sim (now on board the John Adams)
are desirous that he should be retained in the Mediterranean. You
may therefore, should no inconvenience attend it, attach him to one
of the Vessels under your command, most requiring his services. [NDA. OSW, Vol. 6, 1802-1805.1

Herewith you will receive your authority to subdue, seize, and make
prize of, all Vessels, Goods and Effects belonging to the Bey of Tripoli
or to his subjects and also the statute upon which that authority is
founded - also 25 copies of rules and regulations for the Navy which
you will distribute among the Officers under your command. As soon as the Constitution is ready for Sea, you will weigh anchor
and proceed to the Mediterranean. We have a t present in that sea,
the fx+ptes New York, J n ? Adums, Adams and schooner Enterprize.
The fngates New York, John Adums, and Adums are to return immediately to this country. The enclosed Letters which you will forward

You will see the Commanding Officer of the squadron a t present
in the Mediterranean and communicate with him on the subject of
his past and intended operations. From such communication you
may derive useful information and may thereby be enabled to make
a more skilful and advantageous disposition of the force under your

and Seamen of the United States against the Tripolitan Cruisers, the
President is authorized to instruct the Commanders of public Vessels
to subdue, seize and make prize of all vessels, Goods and effects
belonging to the Bey of Tripoli or to his subjects, and to bring or
send the same into port, to be proceeded against and distributed
according to Law, and also to cause to be done all such other acts of
precaution or hostility as the State of war will justify and may in
his opinion requireJ).The varying aspects of our affairs in the Mediterranean - the
great distance between this country and the probable places of your
operations, render it improper for the government to prescribe to
you any particular course of conduct. We therefore leave you unrestrained in your movements and a t liberty to pursue the dictates

an effectual blockade of Tripoli, & that you will by all the means in
your power annoy the Enemy and it is submitted to you whether
during such blockade it would not be advisable to keep some of your
squadron cruising off Cape Bonn. I t is however proper to state to
you that no place is to be considered by you in a state of blockade
which is not actually besieged. Your Commission extending on1 to the capture of vessels, Goods
&I Effects belonging to the Bey of ripoli or to his subjects, you will
bear in mind that the rights of all other nations are to be duly respecbd: that we are a t peace and wish to continue a t peace with
them, and that an Amencan Commander ought to be as much distinguished for his attention and adherence to dl the rights of other
natrons as for his firmness in support of the honor of his own country. You are to refrain from exercising the powers of capturing or recapturing in waters within the jwdictiond limih and under the
protection of any other nation. We shall scrupulously and without
indulgence examine that conduct which shall bring us into collision
with any other Power. So far as may be in your ower, you are to aid, euccour, relieve
and free any American pubic or private vessel attacked by the
Enemy or in their possession. In our present warfare, the taking of valuable prizes cannot be
calculated on. - Our main object is the protection of our commerce
and this we are to effect by depriving the enemy of the means of
annoyance. If however any prize should be taken that may be
deemed worth sending into ort for adjudication, all papers of whatever description found on goard, must be sent with such prize, &
you may also send one or two of the persons found on board, should
they wish it, for the purpose of defending their propert . All Tripolitan Vessels, Goods, and Effects c a p t m 8 in virtue of
your commission, are to be sent into some port in the United States
to be proceeded against and distributed according to Law. With res ect to Prisoners, if a Cartel can be established with
Tripoli to e ect an exchange, it must be done: if found impracticable,
you may then dispose of the Prisoners to an of the powers a t war
with Tripoli, with a reservation, if it can Ke obtained, that they
shall be restored to the U. S. in the event of their demandmg them on
an adjustment of our differences with Tri oli. If neither of these

will give the requisite instructions to aU the Commanding Otficers of
your Squadron on these and all other points. We have heretofore kept dl our deposit of provisions and stores
for the squadron, at Gibraltar. This is so great a distance from the
principal Theatre of our operations that the propriety of continuing to
make Gibraltar our only place of deposit, may well be questioned.
You are therefore a t liberty to cause to be made, de osits of provisions
and stores at Malta, if permitted, or such other p ace in the vicinity
of Tripoli,as you may deem under dl circumshces, the most suitable. I t would be well if you could fix on a place when you get to Gibraltar
as we shall continue to send d our provisions and stores to Gibraltar
thence to be transported to such place, and you might make the
necessary arrangements with M' Gavino while at Gibraltar, If however
you should not determine on a place before you leave Gibraltar, you
will do it as soon thereafter as may be in our power advising M:
Gavino of your determination, and you wdmake with him all the
necessary arrangements for transporting in Merchant Vessels provisions and stores from time to time, under the instructions of the
Commanding Officer for the time being, so as to keep the squadron
arly and fully sup lied. T o u will keep a &mt Eye over the movements of all the other
Barbarg powers and communicate frequently with our Consuls at
Algiers, Tunis, and Tangier, and should any of these powers be induced
to declare or wage war against the U. S. it is the command of the
President and you are hereby instructed to protect our commerce
by d the means in your power against them. The establishment of an Hospital for the reception of the sick and
disabled seamen of the squadron, has heretofore been authorized,
but no such establishment has been made. Care must be talcen of
our seamen & great advantages will result from their being made
sensible that we regard them as an useful class of citizens and in all
respects deserving of our care and attenfion. I deem it, therefore,
proper to invest you with a discretionary power to establish an hospital
m Malta if permitted, or in some other of the most healthy orts in
the vicinity of Tripoli, and you may commit the superinten ency of
it to one of the s eons of the Fleet and if necessary allow him a
Mate. A chest of edicines 4% Instruments was sent to Gibraltar
to be used in such an Establishment. You will, I presume, h d it
there and you will use it if necessary. The conduct for some time past pureued by our squadron in the
Mediterranean, has, unhappily, not been calculated to accomplish
the object of government nor to make a just impression on the Enemy
of our national character. We have therefore transferred to you
the command of our forces in that ma, in full confidence that you will
maintain the dignity of your ststion and that the FLAG of your country
will not be dishonored in your hands.

DEPARTMENT
OF STATE,
Jdy lQth 1803.
SIR. The opinion the President entertains of your unshslren
integrity and firmness has Ied him to select you for the Office of Consul
General a t Algiers, a station in which those qualities are eminently
requisite, and which, as well on that account ae of the importance of
the trust to the peace & interests of your Country, is considered as
highly honorable.
As you have already made yourself in some degree acquainted with
the History and state of our transactions with the Regencies of Barbary, it is the less necessary to dwell upon the explanatory details in
the instructions witb which you are furnished.
The Regency of Algiers being of most importance to the United
States, considering its influence with those of Tunis & Tripoli; and
our stipulations mth that Regency requiring the largest expenditures
are the causes why the Consul General is established there. The
relation of the Consuls for those other Re ncies is therefore a subordinate one, and they will consequently e instructed to correspond
regularly with you, as well as directly with the De artment of State.
I n all cases of difficulty & urgency, they are ta as and follow your
opinion, especially when the state of our affairs ma, require immediate
decision, and where the sacrifice to be made is eit er of an occasional
and not a permanent nature, or of no very high value. They are to
keep regular journals of their proceedings, including their pecuniary
transactions, and transmit transcripts, as often as ma be to you.
be given to
Of so strict a necessity is this latter duty that the
understand that no allowance for di~bufsementsw* be made to them
unless registered in their Journals at the time and transmitted both
to you and this Department, with the very first Di~patchesthey may
wnte to either, after the expense is incurred. The same duty will be
incumbent upon youraeIf y t h the Department of State.
The only written obligation under which the United States remain
to Algiers is to pay her an a ~ ~ u i of
t y12,000 Algerine Sequins; but

r

usage equally imperious, subjects them to the payment of a biennial
present, calculated by Mr O'Brien for the current term at 16,000
Dollars, and a present, on the change of a Consul, of the value of 20,000
dollare accorhng to the same estunate. Neither the value nor the
quality of these presents admits of certainty. They have generally
been procured on the coast of Barbary, but this mode must certainly
be the least advantageous. M' Cathcart was furnished with the sum
of Twenty four thousand dollars, to enable him to procure a Consular
present on his appointment to Algiers. He is therefore directed to
return you the money if not invested, but if it has been done, to deliver
you the articles for the present, and account for the balance, if any, as
you may direct. I n future you will be pleased to give us timely
notice of what the biennial present is to consist, that they may be
laid in here or in Europe. You will be provided witb the sum of
for that which becomes due on the tit@September
money necess
next, which is so the regular termination of the Year, as it regards
the annuity. The annuity is stipulated to be paid in "Maritime
Stores", and "Should the United States forward a larger quantity
(than is due) the overplus is to be paid for in money by the Dey and
Regency" - It will perhaps seldom happen that much more than
is due &ill be forwarded at any time, and we should generdy prefer
that any occasional overplus should be carried to the account of the
succeedmg year. Next September, two Years annuities will be due,
for which two or three Vessels have been engaged at Norfolk to make
the remittance. The whole will probably arrive before you, and be
delivered and accounted for by Mr OBrien. The articles for the
annuity are directed from time to time, by the Deys order. Those
lately sent complete the list given by him, and they are presumed to
be sufficient to produce a balance in our favor, after SepP next.
There is much room for address, to obtain the payment of the annuity
in articles which are favorable and to avoid such as are disadvantageous; for they are not received at the current price but according to an
established standard of value. M' OBrien informs us that a loss of 3
or 4 Cent pr Cent is incurred upon powder, cables, cordage & canvass,
which is not the case with Timber, plank, scantling, small masts,
spars, pipe-staves and spikes.
An experiment has been tried whether it were possible to procure
a change in the Treat so as to enable us to pay the annuity m Cash
instead of stores, whicTl are sometimes S c u l t to be procured, according to the requisitions of the Dey, and are liable to accidents in the
remittance. It succeeded for the for the last annuity paid, viz. for
the Year ending in Septr 1801, which encouraged a repitition, of the
attempt for the succeeding years but without success, probably
because the last order, which was for timber for buildmg two frigates,
had been partially complied with, and the Dey wished it to be cornpleated by us, as it now is. The present period, when he will receive
together a biennial and a Consular present, immediately after so
large a quantity of Stores, may be auspicious to an attempt to make
tbe commutation, into Cash permanent, and you will accordingly
exert yourself to effect it. You will also from the best advice you
can obtain, ascertain whether these presenta may not be separately
diminished from what is customary when they fall due a t different
periods or whether they may not be blended and their joint amount
reduced.

NAVAL OPERATIONS FROM 1802 TO 1803

Your salary will be at the rate of 4000 Dollars per m u m , with an
allowance of the same sum as an outfit and a quarters salary for the
expense of your return, to commence from the day of your receiving
notice of our recall. You will also be allowed House Rent on a
moderate ut decent scale, the expense of Couriers, postage,.printing,
when necessary, of a Secretary's and Dmgermans services, and
presents which the custom of the Regency require to be made to its
Officers. There may be calls for Charitable donations, but it has
been judged most consonant with principle and public interest, to
refer them to the Consuls private account, and to free the Treasury,
from them. Should you find any usage requiring National charities,
you will be pleased to state them, & their amount for consideration.
All proper means are to be used to prevent American Vessels, which
may come to Algiers, from taking freights there on account of the
Subjects of the Barbary States; as the Regencies assume it as a principle that compensation is due from the Nation whose flag the vessel
bears for any capture it may be subjected to, and an estimate of the
indemnity is regulated by an arbitrary price set upon the Cargo.
It is ascertained that the American Mediterranean Passport has
been forged in Spain, m d probably there may be some copies of it in
circulation. To guard against the embarrassing effects of such a
circumstance and to obviate some imperfections in the form of the
old passport, a new plate has been engraved, three im ressions from
which are herewith enclosed, one for yourself and eac of the other
Consuls. A fourth is enclosed for James Simpson Esqr our Consul at
Tangier. You will also receive Two hundred tops of this pass ort,
to be divided amongst you, including Mr Simpson. You w& be
pleased to intimate to the Regency of Algiers this change, and that it
will take effect within nineteen months from the time of the intimation, of which you will immediately write to me by so man opportunities as will ensure an early receipt of the information. f b u will
direct the Consuls at Tunis and Tripoli (should peace take place with
the latter) to do the like towards the Governments at which they
reside, and give me information in the same manner.
to this arrangement, the Barbary Cruisers will be immediately supplie
with Tops of the new passport, and every Vessel must be suffered
to pass with either until the e iration of the nineteen months;
after which the new passport will"ge the only one used.
You are apprised that after acquitting all our engagements to
Tripoli, its Bashaw commenced an unprovoked war upon us. Mr
Cathcart has been hitherto cha ed with negociations for peace with
him; but the President has thoug t fit to entrust them to you, should
they remain unsuccessful on your arrival in the Mediterranean. In
conducting them, you will have referrence to the instructions given to
MT Cathcart (co ies of which are enclosed) and especially to those
contained in my etter of the 9'9 April. A letter from the President
to the Badmw, acquainting him with your appointment, is enclosed.
It would be expedient that you should call a t Gibraltar on your entering the Mediterranean to enquire of the situation of Mr Cathcart; an
interview with him appears to be essential previously to your entering
on these negociations, in order that he may fully.explam to you the
s t a b of our Barbary transactions. The mstrucbons respecting the
proposed biennial payment to Tunis, in lieu of ih occasional demands,

Mr OJBrienstates that we are indebted in the sum of 15,073 dollars

to the B

setti'ement taking place, which you are authorised to m d e . Cap$
Preble has orders to stop at Gibraltar or any other convenient port,
to enable you to enquire for Mr Cathcart, and afterwards to concert
with you the times & plan of visiting the other places which it may be
requisite for you to touch at, in the exicution of these instruct~ons.
You will be supplied with the sum of 43,000 Dollars for the objects
stated in the enclosed estimate.*

P.S. The universal toleration in matters of religion in most of our
States, and the entire want of power respecting them in the general
Government, has as we understand induced the Barbary powers, to
view us more favorably than other Christian Nations who are exclusively so, and with whom these powers consider themselves in
erpetual hostility, suspended only at times, by tempomq truces.
ft is recommended to you to avail us of this fact & opinion, as far as
it can be used to lessen the unequal condition of the intercourse between us. All the extraordinary expenses to which you may be
subjected by the negociations with Tunis and Tripoli, will be reimbursed to you.

SIBThe Bashaw of Tripoli is now collecting a Considerable Army
which he intends to March against the inhabitants of the Guerrian
Mountains, who revolted about Two weeks ago and killJdthe Bashaw's
Son in law, the Chief Hamadar and made them selves Masters of
above 500 Camels loaded with Grain and a considerable Sum of
Money-the Bashaw had sent the Hamadar to levy Contribution on
those people, and he probably had proceeded with too much severity;
the people of Guerrian seem determined to defend themselves, but
the Bashaws light Artillery gives him too great a Superiority to
Arabs Armed simply with Muskets, many of which are Match locks,
which in rainy weather renders them of little or no service - The

BOSTON
16tQJuly 1803
SIR,I have been informed that the Tripolines have a very considerable coasting trade in which they employ a number of vessels
from 30 to 150 tons constructed and rigged in a manner peculiar to
the Mediterranean
If ColQLear should not be successfull in his mission can I be authorized to hire or purchase three or four vessels of about 40 or 50 tons of
the above description-eitherat Malta or elsewhere: for the purpose of
capturing or destroyln the Tripoline Merchant Vessels, and distressing their coast?
ose Vessels should arm as they do their
coasters say with two or four Guns on deck and should man them
with an enterprizing Lieutenant, three or four Midshipmen a Surgeons
Mate, and about 50 or 60 petty Officers Seamen and Marines from
the Squadron, Only a certain number to appear on deck at a time when
near the coast, or in sight of any vessel, and those to be in the Tripoline Garb with the turban - This method would enable them to
approach the Coast without suspicion for the purpose of reconnoitering
and probably be the means of capturing some valuable prizes I suspect those barbarians will not be dis osed to make peace with
us, untd they feel sensible of our ability an determination to distress
them by every possible means. If ou should not think pro er to allow me three or four of those
resseE, may I employ one s d o n e as a reconnoitering tender?
The Wcers of the Wardroom of the Constddion are very desirous
of having their appartment decently furnished that they may receive
those Gentleman who visit the Ship abroad, in a manner suitable to
their rank as Wcers, and agreeable to their feelin

July lg* 1803
SIB I am hon* with your much esteemed and very friendly favour
of the 14t@Inst I am extremely hurt that any persons should have
made the observations hinted a t in your letter but it convinces me
that they are not acquainted with the duty I have had to perform or
the difliculties I have had to encounter.
It is now eight weeks since I took charge of this ship The 20t@
May I r e d orders to Command. She was to be hove down & coppered
and it was the 2gtQbefore she could be got to a wharf for that pur-

pose owing to the wind & weather, and want of a proper number of
men. Not any Officer but the Sailq Master and one Midshipman,
and not one of her crew, attached to her - she was stripped of every
thing but her lower-masts and ballast. I was obliged to hire men by
the day to remove her to the careening place & take out the ballast and to strengthen & prepare the Wharf, as this is the first ship of her
rate in our service that has ever been hove Keel out in Ameriea, we
had every thing to create for the careening business. Ships of this
size are easily handled and prepared for sea in almost any situation
when they have their proper crews on board - Four hundred men
acquainted with the duty they have to perform can do much - but
with the assistance I have had, it is no easy task to accomplish as
much as I have done - in the same time - would to God I could
have done more, Zeal on my part has not been wanting. I have
made use of every exertion in my power, and have devoted myself so
wholly to the service - as even to deny myself the pleasure of dining
with a friend, three Sundays have I hired men to work to forward
the business and attended to them myself - You may rest assured
I should deem myself unworthy of your friendship if I did not exert
myself in the service of my Country when called on. I t was the lo*
of June before the Captsterns- Rigging &c could be made and the
ship prepared for heaving down, between that and the 17* one side
was stripped of all the old copper, every seam in it recaulked, and
the bottom new coppered. The ship was then to be winded and prepared for heaving down the other side - This was done & the Cop ermg compleated on the 26* June. The ship had been la
by so ong
a time that the plank had shrunk and it was absolu y necessary to
recaulk every seam in her. The whole of the standing rigging was to
strip & refit owing to its having been fitted in cold weather. I have
had much joiners work to do - The cabbin bulk heads were so placed
as to prevent the guns from running out of the Ports - of course they
were to be shifted - all the Officers births & rooms in the ward room
were to remove - they were so constructed that we could not caulk
under them. Midshipmens bulk head to build, Store-rooms to finish
& [word illegible] Magazine & filling room to cop er - Bread & sail
rooms to tin, Iron work to make - Cables & Cor'it age to make. The
cables are not yet finished but will be next week - it takes a long
time to spin the yarns - and it requires that they should lay in the
coil after having been tarred two or three weeks before they are laid
, we have had the ship wholly to ballast, $ water with 54000 GallP

directed 60 more to be shipped at York and expect to be able to compleat our compliment here by the time they arrive. I have gone thus
full into this subject, that you may have zt in your power on proper
grounds to defend me from any improper refiectiom on the tardiness
of this equipment. More than has been done here, cannot be done
in the same time with the same number of men in any Port of the

since it was on my assurance twelve Months ago that they would soon
be here that the derangement then happen'd was accommodated. I muid say much more but that I cannot depend on Letters reaching
in these times. - Under these circumstances its in my o p b o n highly
re uisite a Ship should be hereabouts until the fate of the Me~houda
be own; and if she be condemned that it will be indispensably necessarg for the rotection of the Trade. If you co d send me by any of your Frigates comeing Down two

awe table, and 1 will thankfully pay the cost.

SIR,I yesterday acknowledged the rec 1 of a Packet containing my
Sailing Orders, Instructions and sundry etters It is now two months since I took charge of this Frigate and I
deeply regret that she is not ready to Sail at this moment, I have done
all m my power to equip and man her, would to heaven I could have
done more! for be assured I feel as anxious to be in sight of Tripoly
as you can possibly wish me to be Wages in the Merchant service has risen and we have not been
able to increase our number of men here, more than One or two a day
for several days past, one of the Midshipmen (M: Stewart) has
recruited ten Men at Providence the other Officer (Lt Jenckes) who
resides a t that place and gave me ve flattering hopes that he could
procure many has been unsuccessfJhaving recrrlllted only one 0.
Seaman - The Men recruited at New York by Lieutenant Blake
have not yet arrived we ?ant their assistance much it does not require
much time to equip a *ate
for Sea with her proper complement of
men on board - Three or four hundred men, ac uainted with their
duty can do much, but our numbers have genera y been small compared to the object - The men we have engaged here, are not such
as I wish wages are so high in the merchant service that the best men
will not ship with us - I do not believe that I have twenty native
American Sailors on board. If the men from New York arrive here
in Season I expect to be read for Sea, b the last day of this month.
I shall write you often until sail, and s all not fail writing by every
opportunity that may offer while abroad - as there will robabl be
tune for me to have an answer to this - please send me t e S p s in
use in our service as I have none My instructions directs me to "capture the vessels of the Bey of
Tripoly and of his Subjects &c* and to respect the rights of other
Nations - do you consider that h t to extend to their entering the

the Commission for Tunis was not enclosed probably left out by

a greek Polacca bound to Corpi whose master has agreed to land me
at Malta where I no doubt wdl find some of our shps of war & will
proceed to execute the Presidents orders with an alacrity proportionable to the means f h h ' d me, I have endeavor'd to negotiate funds
for the purpose but find it dif?icult to procure cash for bills upon
government & I am not furnish'd with a credit elsewhere, none as
yet offer'd to accept them for less than twelve pr Cent which wiU
Induce me to only draw for s d c i e n t to facilitate a negotiation with
Tripoli which is absolutely necessary as that Bashaw prefers a sum
comparatively smaller on the moment an agreement is made to a,
much larger gratuity payable at a distant period. I sail tomorrow God willing upon a mission not very congenial to
my feelings, but the President may depend upon my punctually
obeying my instructions however mortifying to my own pride &
sense of national dignity; but government are the proper & best
judges of the steps necessary to be taken to promote the welfare of
the community in enerd & I bend to imperious necessity, but not
without a sigh! I ong ere now expected to see Tripoli prostrate at
our feet, one small effort would have establish'd our national character
with that Regency for s century better than a million sterling, but for
want of energy & a spirit of enterprize we bring o w humiliations to
their Bashaws foot stool. [NA. SDA. CL, Tripoli, Vol. 2, June 1801-Sept. 1805.1

of the Guns, I found it so hi h, that the Gun could not be worked
in the Port; of course I have een obliged to land the whole of them
for alteration. As the Carriages are all new, and made on purpose
for this Ship, under the direction of the Oficer at that time comrnandr
I had no suspicion of their not having been properly calculated. this
will take up four or five days at least. The weather has been too wet
to take off our Bread. It's now raining, and we only wait for fair

SIR I have the honor to transmit for your consideration the following plan of negotiation with the Regency of Tripoli with my

my former opinion that Peace with Tripoli is attainable by co-ercive
measures; for at this moment I would suffer to be crucified If with the
sum I a m em-power'd to expend there applied in measures more
congenial to our feelings if that petty Tyrant would not in less than
two months sue for peace upon our own terms & sign the Treat on

board our Comodores Ship. - But Sir the government of the

who have already set us the example, I therefore drop my former ideas
not from conviction but in obedience to my instructions, & actuated
s zed for the service, I am ready to put them in execution with an
ab~acrity proportionate to the means furnish'd me. It is unnecessary to entar into elaborate minuteness with you Sir

when it could have been render'd most serviciable, that at the moment

her being captured going into Tripoli, though it furnishes sufficient
ounds for her legal condemnation it will be denied by both the
gashaw of Tripoli & Em emr of Morocco because not congenial to
their interests those poop e will not acknowledge the most palpable
facts when prejudicial to their preconcerted views of rapine &
de redation. f t is likewise to be observ'd that said prize has been always supposed
to be worth 30,000 dollars at Tripoli, the Bashaw ransom'd her from
Portugal for that sum, which is five times her value, excluaive of what
other property their is on board, & a number of his subjects among
whom is is his vice Admiral, & although he holds up the idea that he
sets no value upon them, I know by experience that at the same
moment he sooths their relations by giving them small presents &
promising them the speady liberation of their friends. Viewing the above premises I presume it would be conducive to our
interests to make said prize a medium of accomodation with Tripoli
in preference to cash, & in order that the Captors may be indemnified
for her value in case the Bashaw acoepts of her as the price of Peace;
I will give them bills upon government for her value after it is ascertain'd by a regular appraisment. If the above proposal meets your ideas it would be of advantage to
order her to be painted & her yards & rigging black'd & tar'd, in order
to make the Bashaw suppose we set some value on her - & increase
his desire of repossessing her, by her appearing before his ca ital in
this situation it would interest his pnde & thus add the orce of
another passion to that of his cupidity in our favor & it undoubtedly
would be more honorable as well as advantageous to divide a sum of
among our own Citizens than to give it to the Bashaw of
Tnpo ' provided it answer'd the same purposes. Whatever plans are adopted I presume the greatest dispatch is
necessary as well to prevent the capture of our defenceless merchantmen the consequences of which would be fatal to our negotiations, as
to prevent the Bashaw of Tripoli from idluencing the Emperor of
Morocco in his favor, which might render a dipsion of our force
necessary $ consequently .expose our commerce m a much greater
to the effects of thew depredations. f we advert to the exhorbitancy of the Bashaws demands which I
am informed is *500,000 dollars & an annuity of twenty thousand
dollars, it is necess
to observe that he demands a great deal in
order to obtain a sm 1 part & he is properly answer'd by an offer of
5000 Dollam. I conceive Sir that I have now done what is incumbent on me in
stating my opinion for your consideration I have only to add that if
Messrq Degen & Purviance has the cash ready to embark for which I
have given them bills upon government, that I can embark in four

16* August 1803. SIR Nq 60 dated 28" last Month was forwarded in triplicate by
wa of Gibraltar. - The two Ships have sailed from Larach and
S& on their Cruize, and the two Galleys built last ye= at Tetuan
have been by great exertions got over the Bar of thst River, now
nearly dry; they are daily expected here to compleat their e ui ment
when they will be employed m and about the Straits, as sue% $easels
usually are. - Another G d e y is geting ready at Tetuan and the
Governour of this lace talks of arming a two Masted Boat lately
seized here under enoeae Colours. We have not had any tidings of the two Frigates since they sailed,
which I confess I a m very anxious to receive. I feel great concern a t not having been able to satisfy the enquirp
of this Government respecting the fate of the Ship detained by Commodore M o d Squadron and carried to Malta, no other Letter from
him on the subject has reached me besides that of the 19* May
mentioned to you in Nq 59. M' Gavino tells me for want of conveyance my answer to that
Letter was long detained at Gibraltar. In this state of things I have considered it proper to recommend
in the strongest manner, thro' M' Gavino, to the Captains of the
Vessels of War he tells me are expected from the United States, that
two of them remain on this station, until1 the opperations of the
Emperours Cruizers actualy at Sea be known. - The necessity of this
measure was obvious to me so soon as I found the Frigates were to
sail with sealed Orders; I aincerel hope the precaution may not in
fact be necessary, but I trust it d b e admitted by you as proceeding
from my anxiety for the good of the Service, viewing it as the best
mode can be adopted for protection of the Commerce, without giving
it any un-necessary alarm. - On Friday last Alcayde Hashash gave
notice to the Consuls that Ris Imperial Majesty would ve soon be

This is an unexpected visit, we believe it has been occasioned by sbme
late dessensions between the Governour of this place and the people
of the Neighborhood. It will afford me m opportunity of renewing to His Majesty aseurancss of the steady disposition of the Government of the United
State3 to maintain Peace with this Country, and to discuss matters
fully with his Minister, which I most ardent1 wish I ma be able
to accomplish on a pleasant footing. - On t& occasion must as
every other Consul not only make a handsome present to His Ma'esty,
but to the Cheifs and others of his Court; for which purpose this
day desire Mr Gavino to provide a variet of Articles suitable for
that purpose, and for payment I transmit

the cause of her not going off yesterday, was owing to the ways not

& I am in great hopes I shall be ready m a shorter time The officers that have joined the Argus are LieutQBlake, bvingston

a Boatswain, Gunner, & Carpenter, their names are Geo. Nicholson
Boatswain, Robs Huntress Gunner, & John Gay carpenter, they have
been in the situations they are now in before & have all been highly
recommended; from what I have observed since they have been under
my command, I conceive the are highly qualifyed for the situations,
they have engaged to go in t$e Brig provided they get warrants previous to sailing, should you think proper to grant those men warrants,
I would be glad if they could be forwarded as soon as convenient Dr Tisdale has not joined the brig & I conceive it doubtful whether
he will or no, if he does not we may be placed in a very awkward situation, most of our men will be from New-York where it is certain a contageous disorder exists, Lieuf Blake who is recruiting at New York has
informed me four of the men he has entered have dyed with this disorder, should no surgeon or mate get on b the time I am ready, I shall

You will use it economically and distribute it among the v
d of the
squadron under your command, charging their respective Commanders
to spend no part of it unnecessarily and to be economical in what they
do expend. My reason for sending you this sum of money, is this. You would
otherwise in all probability be constrained to draw bills to a great disadvantage so long as the present war continues in Europe. This sum
by being judiciously distributed among the squadron, ma render it
unnecessary for the Commanders to draw on either of the p aces where
a credit is deposited for them, or it will so far abridge the amount of
their drafts, that no considerable loss in the Exchange w i l l be experienced. - The Carronades for the Argw having been procured in

SIR,I had the honor of writing you on the 24*@inst. info
had that day arrived in the Bay of Gibralter & received news of ripolitan cruisers being off cape de Gatt, which made me proceed the

On the 26'4 at 8 p. m. abreast of AImeria Bay we fell in with and
captured the Moorish Ship of War Mirboka of 22 guns & 100 men,
commanded by captain Ibrahim Lubarez, who had in company the
American Brig Ceilia of Boston, Richard Bowen master, her prize;
that night blowing fresh with a high sea detention in getting the
prisoners on board and Manning the cruiser occasioned our loosing
sight of the Brig; but the following night at 12 oClock being close in

I am now bound with both vessels to Gibralter. For further

I trust that tbe circumstances relating to the capture will appear
in the opinion of the President of the United States, proper justification for my conduct in detaining the Ship without a declaration of

what ever but the reverse, to have proceeded to Tripoli without funds
or credit, the Bashaw as in a former instance would increase his
demands in proportion to the lenght of time that must necessarily
elapse between the agreement taking place & its completion & on
the contrary would moderate his terms in proportion to the apparent
certainty of our s eedily compl g with them.
I likewise had t e honor to m o m you that I had taken m passage

me to reconcile to my ideas of propriety; he declared he had not the
least intention to wound my feelings, that he conceiv'd he could
negotiate with those powers without my assistance & that consequently my services were unnecessary, of the result government are
the best jud es; though it is worthy of remark that in his communication to Mr issen of the 5'h of June he acknowledges his being unacquainted with the usages of Barbary, how extraordinary then doth it
ap ear that at the moment he contemplated a negotiation he should

government for that purpose & who was perfectly acquainted wit

[LC. EPP, Journal 1803.1

[31 August 18031
Concerning Commodore Morris' squadron in the Mediterranean

On the 29th of May, 1803, he [Commodore Morris] addressed a
letter to N. Nissen, esq. his Danish majesty's consul at Tripoli,
"soliciting" him to communicate to the Bashaw of Tripoli, "that he
and that
was authorized by his government to negotiate with h,"
he was "ready to commence a treaty immediately, should he (the
Bashaw) be & sed for peace."
On the 31st E a y the Bashaw informed him that he had named
;'his trusty minister Mahamed Dghies," with fuh power to negotiate;
and closed his communication with the following observation: "I do
not fear war - it is my trade - I understand it better than any
body."
The commodore proposed that the negotiation should be conducted
on board the New York; which arrangment, however could not be
agreed to, in consequence of the indisposition of Mahamed Dghies.
It was therefore decided, upon the commercial agent of the French
Republic, then resident at Tripoli, becoming responsible for the safety
of the commodore's person, that the business should be conducted on
shore. An interview took place on the 7th June; and on the 8th the
minister, Dghies, informed commodore Morris that his master, the
Bashaw, demanded two hundred thousand Spanish milled dollars
and the expenses of the war "for a peace;" intimating his disposition
to "employ his influence" to induce his master to lower his demands.
On the same day commodore Morris offered a present of five
thousand dollars in specie, on condition of the Bashaw's agreeing to
the project of a treaty of peace which had been prepared, and was
submitted. To this offer he received "a verbal message" informing
him "that the business was a t an end, and that he must depart immediately," and thus ended the negotiation.
On the loth June, commodore Morris, with the New-York and
Enterprize, uitted the coest of Tripoli, and proceeded to Malta,
leaving the ohn Adam and Adams to continue the blockade of that
port. It appears to have been the intention of commodore Morris,
to leave these two ships off Tripoli, and to proceed with the New-York
and Enlerprize down the north side of the Mediterranean, touching
st the several ports, for the
ose of affording convoy to such of
our merchantmen as he sho d d in them; but on h s arrival at
Malta, he receive a letter from Mr. Davis, charge des affair@a t Tunis,
(dated 24th March, 1803,) informin him, that there was a "strong
armament fitting out a t Tunis, an that a junction was intended
between the fleet of that power and the Algerines." This informa-

f

527

tion rendered it expedient, in the commodore's opinion, to keep the
"whole of his squadron together," that he might "be prepared to
meet so formidable a force," expecting that they only wated a favorable opportunit to declare war. Under these cmcumstances, he
"raised the bloc ade of Tripoli;" on the 26th June, 1803, collected
his whole force a t Malta, and thence proceeded to Messina, Naples,
and Leghorn, where he arrived on the 13th August, from which place
he despatched the John Adam with convoy to Gibrdtar - the
Adams with Mr. Cathcart, to Tunis, and thence to Gibraltar - and
the Enterprize back to Malta for despatches, (which he had understood had passed up to Malta, for him,) to be brought to him off cape
De Gatt. Having made these arrangements, the commodore left
Leghorn, in the N m Pork, for Gibrdtar, and touching a t Malaga on
his way thither, he received his letter of suspension dated 21st June which transferred the command of the squadron, and of the frigate
New York to commodore Rodgers, and directed commodore Monis
to take charge of the Adums, and return without delay to the United
States, where he arrived on the 21st November, 1503.
On his arrival, he was called on for an explanation of his conduct
his command. The considerations which had induced the
Presi ent to direct bis suspension were frankly and explicitly stated
to him; but he could offer no explanabon that was deemed satisfac%ry. It was therefore determined to institute a solemn inquiry into
hw conduct; and as from the warrant, convening the court on this
occasion, we may see the causes of his suspension, it IS here given a t
length:

%

duY

To Samuel Barron, esq. a capfain in the Nagl of the Uniied States.
"Whereas, the President of the United States did send a squadron
of ships of war to the Mediterranean, and did give the command
thereof to Richard V. Morris, a captain in the Navy of the United
States, with orders and instructions to subdue, seize, and make prize
of ad vessels, goods, and effects belonging to the Bashaw of Tn li,
or to his subjects; and to exert such other efForts as should be j u & d
most proper for annoying the enemy and for pmtec
the commerce
and seamen of the United States; and whereas Richar V. Morris was
specially instructed to proceed with the squadron under his command
and lay off against Tripoli, and closely and vigorously blockade that
ort; ail which will, by our several instructions hereto annexed, more
full appear. And whereas, a close and vigorop blockade of the port
of ripoli hath not been made; and all pract~cablemeans have not
been used to annoy the enemy: concerning the came of which disobedience and neglect, we think it necessarg that inquiry should be
made, in order that we may have a f Jthful report made to us of the
causes thereof, for our better information. The President of the
United States hae therefore charged me to call a court of inquiry, for
the purpose aforesaid; and you are hereby accordingly ordered to
proceed to ttus place, to act as a member of the said court, and being
the senior officer called, you will be the President thereof. Notifications are also transmitted to captain Hugh G. Campbell and lieutenant
John Cessin, with orders to appear a t this place, on or before the first
day of Ap& next, as members of the court; and the court is hereby

R.SMITE,Secretary of the Navy
Under this precept the court, consisting of
Capt. Samuel Baron, President.
Walter Jones, Jr. Esq. Judge Advocate.
Convened in the City of Washington, on the 3d April, 1804, and continued its sessions, by adjournment from day to day, till the 13th April,
1804 - and its finding was as follows:
Friday, 13th April, 1804. Present all the members and the Judge
Advocate.
"The court wss cleared, and proceeded to form and pronounce their
opinion, as follows. viz.
"This court having carefull examined, and deliberately weighed,
the evidence produced, and a that was alleged by captaln Richard
V. Morris, in explanation or in vindication of his conduct, do report,
as their opinion:
"That the said captain Morris did not conduct himself, in his
command of the Mediterranean squadron, with the diligence or
activity necessary to execute the important duties of his station; but
that he is censurable for his inactive and dilatory conduct of the squadron under his command, in these ipstances, viz.
"1. In remaining with, and detslning his squadron at Malta, without necessity, or any adequate object, answerable to the length of
his stay and detention aforesaid: that is to say, from the 5th to the
30th day of January, 1803; and from the 11th to the 19th day of
February, 1803; and also from the 1st to the 21st day of May, 1803.
"2. In carrying his whole s uadron, on the 19th February, 1803,
from Malta to Tunis bay, an?Ithence down to Gibraltar, and not
returning with, or sending back any part of his squadron till the
month of May following, having, in the mean time, no part of his
squadron on the station aloft, to cruise off the coast of Tripoli, or
otherwise protect our commerce in that quarter, as occasion might
Beme.
"3. I n remaining with, and detaining his squadron at Gibraltar
without necessity, or any adequate object, till too late a period in
the spring of the year 1803; that is to say, from the 23d March to the
1lthA nl,1803.
"4. n not proceeding with, or sending any part of his squadron
(after the one unsuccessful attempt in the month of J n n u g , 1803)
to the coast of Tripoli, till he sent captain Rodgers from M ta wit11
the frigate John A h alone, on the 5th May, 1803; who arrived
with his frigate on the 8th May following.
"5. I n not going sooner than the 22d May, 1803, to the coast of

"And this court do further report, that, as to the period that the
Mediterranean squadron was under the command of captain Morris,
from 25th May, 1802, when he first arrived in the Mdterranean, to
the 5th January, 1803, when he was joined at Malta by Captain
James Barron, with the frigate New Ywk, and by captain John
Rodgers, with the frigate John Adam8, there are no facts disclosed by
the evidence, sufficient1 clear*and explicit, whereon to ground any
censure of the conduct o ca tam Morris, in his command aforesaid, or
whereon to form any spec& opinion, suEciently ati is factory to the
judgment and conscience of this court. Wherefore they have limited
the expression of their opinion to such periods of his command, and
to such parta of his conduct, as they could, from the evidence, fairly
and clearly psss an opinion upon."

When commoclore Morris arrived near the coast of Tripoli [22 May
18031, with his squadron, a number of merchant v d . , convoyed by
several gunboats, were discovered, making for Tripoh. Chase was
immediately given. The gun boats escaped into Tripoli. The merchant vessels, eleven in number, loaded with wheat, were driven into
Old Tripoli. Lieutenant David Porter proposed to the commodore
to take the boats of the squadron, the following night, and attack
these vessels, then defended by a number of men staboned near a
large stone building; but the commodore, calculating that his force
would enable him to obtain them b "negotiation,." declined concurring in the proposition. - He, Kowever, p m t t e d lieutenant
Porter, in the course of the night, to proceed mth four men in an open
boat and m d e d oars, to reconnoitre the position of the vessels,
reparatory to an attack, in the event of "mgotiatwn" failing.
Leutenant Porter completed his observations without interruption not a single shot having been fired at him, till he put about to row
off, when innumerable vollies of musketry were discharged towards
him - he escaped, however, without having sustained the slightest
injury; owing, no doubt, to the darkness of the night, which, while
it served him, served the enemy also, so effectually as to prevent a
discovery of the operations they were then amying on. The next
morning it was perceived that the enemy had, dunng the night, hauled
up all the vessels a t high tide, and erected extensive breast works from
both sides of the stone building; and that the vessels were lying side
by side, high and dry, their sterns within twenty feet of the breast
work, so as to render lt impossible for them to be cut out. Previously
to belug hauled up, the vessels were unloaded, and their cargoes O>ags
of wheat) with stonea collected in the neighborhood, formed the
breastwork, which waa on a bank, fifteen to eighteen feet high, and

bshind which it was perceived a great number of armed men, collected during the night, were stationed, ready to defend the veasels;
and a multitude of cavalrg covered the high grounds, presenting a
grand and formidable appearance. It is supposed, indeed, that almost
the whole force of Tripoli h d been d r a m to this point during the
night. Under these circumstsnces, the boats of the s uadron undar

2

the command of lieutenant Porter, were manned and or ered to attack
and set f i e to the vessels. Unappslled by the preparations made to
receive them, they proceeded on this service, in open day. As soon
as they arrived within musket shot, the men behind the breastwork
commenced a heavy fire upon them, which wuld only be returned
occasionsly, as they showed their heads above the works, or came out
from behind them. AE the boats a prmched, several of our men were
Idled and wounded
among t f e latter, lieutenant Porter, who
received a slight wound in the nght thigh, and a be31 through the left,
which, however, did not occasion one moment's intermission of his
exertions. Proceedii steadily to their object, they were so near the
works, that five or six of the enemy stepped from behind them,
picked up handfulls of pebbles and earth, threw at them, and then
d i s c w e d their piecas. The moment, however, of their discovery
was the moment of their fate - the whole of them were shot down the boats advanced within pocket-pistol shot of the breastwork, and
their crews leaped from them, boarded the vessels, and set fire to the
whole of them - then,
eeably to a reconcerted arrangement, they
retired to the right and eft, so as to eave an opening for the fire of
our ships, they lying within point blank shot - the ships accordingly
opened upon the enemy, in the expectation of completing the work
so gallantly co~mencedby the boats; but the enemy, in apparent
disregard of the many broadsides discharged at them, came in bodias
from behind their breastwork, extinguished the flames, and pre8erved
their vessels.
Lieutenant Porter, althoJ severely woundad, proposed to renew the
attempt; but the commodore considered the semce too hazardous,
and the enterprize was abandoned.
The service performed by the boab of the squadron, reflected honor
upon their several commanders asd crews-the names of all were
never reported; but those of lieutenant David Porter, lieut. James
Lawrence, and midshipman John Domes, were mentioned as deaerving particular distinction. Many thousand balls were fired by the
enemy from muskets and pistole, and yet, astonishing to relate, our
whole loss in killed and wounded, did not, it is believed, exceed fourteen - the loss of the enem from the fire of the boats and sbips, is
unknown to us; but it has een estimated as far ester than ours,
notwithstanding the decided advmtagea under w 'ch they fought,
behind a breast work, proof against musket ball at least, and with
numbers probably twenty t h e e greater than that of the boats.
Several of their horses were cut in two by cannon shot, from our ships,
and their riders were seen to fall as if dead.

the 28 May, it was decided to mske an sttack on tbe gun b t s
off Tripoli; but the result was not calculated to produce any serious
d e c t u n the enemy, owing, it is presumed, to the very umkilful
and aw ard manner in which the attack waa commenced. The
John Adccm, captain Rodgers, then considerably in the rear of the
bore
other ships was ordered to lead the van, and thst ship ~ccor-y
up, and gained a position as near to the enemy aa possible, and o ened
upon them. The psition of the commodore's ship, (the N m fork,)

6

at that oint of tlme, was a b u t three cables le th on the weather
bow of t e John Adam, and the position of the a m was about one
cable'a length on her weather beam, which rendered it impcssible for
their fire to reach the enemy, without endangering the John Adam,
she being directly in their line of fire. This extraordinary mismmage
ment on the art of commodore Morris drew upon him much censure.
In defence offurwelf, he says, "It was my wish and intention to destroy
the enemy and their boatw, and if the &position of the ships was not
at one time exactly aa I could have wished it to have been, still I
cannot impute it to rnysdf as an offence, but to causes that I could not
controd. The aame might, and no doubt has happened to abler and
better seamen than myself; the esca e of the enemy, under their
batteries, was entirely owing to ths c&an ess of the weather, and the
fast approach of night."
The commodore expressed great satisfaction in b
able to state,
that during the whole period of his command in the editerran-,
"there was not a citizen of the United States in those seas, who either
lost his property or was made a captive," trnd so far ae regarded the
protection of our trade in that distant sea, his squadron c&y
rendered essential services, altho h no incidents (other than those
above rnen[tion]ed,) calculated to t row any degree of lustre upon our
trrme. occurred duriug his command. T ~ is
Mto be aecribed, not to
an deficiency in personal courage on the part of the commodore, but
to
indolence, and want of capacity. Be might have
uitted himself well in the command of a single ship, under the orders o a superior,
but he wss not competent to the command of a squadron.
